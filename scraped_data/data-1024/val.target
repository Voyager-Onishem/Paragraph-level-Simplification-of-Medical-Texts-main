In general, we thought that the quality of the evidence was moderate. The main factor reducing our confidence was concern that the results of some studies might have been biased by the way they were done. We cannot be sure that the results apply to treatment longer than six months. After six months of treatment, there are benefits of donepezil that are large enough to measure in studies. It is associated with side effects that are mainly mild, but that may cause people to stop treatment.
Being able to stabilise cognitive performance or ability to maintain activities of daily living may be important clinically. In terms of total healthcare costs the use of donepezil appears cost neutral. However, there does not appear to be an effect on quality of life. More data are still required from longer-term clinical studies examining measures of disease progression or time to needing full time care.
This review found two small studies, one comparing a graft using a new material with a traditional graft, the other looking at the benefit of applying a special type of glue to the graft. Both studies were considered to be of poor quality and so no conclusions can be reached about whether either of these new techniques is better than the traditional type of graft.
This review included 19 studies reporting the outcomes of ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon versus hamstring tendon grafts in a total of 1597 young to middle-aged adults. Many trials used flawed methods that might have affected their results.
The limited data available for functional outcomes including patient-rated assessment did not show whether one graft was better than the other. Similarly, there were no differences found between the two types of graft for re-rupture or in the results of an internationally used knee score. All tests for knee stability favoured patellar tendon grafts. Conversely, people had more anterior knee pain and discomfort with kneeling after patellar tendon reconstruction. After patellar tendon reconstruction, more people had some loss in their ability to straighten out their leg at the knee. In contrast, more people had some loss in their ability to bend their leg at the knee after hamstring tendon reconstruction. It is not clear how important these losses in range of motion of the knee were to the patients themselves.
The review concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to recommend which of the two types of graft was better for ACL reconstruction.
Seven eligible studies were identified, all of which provided information on response to treatment (in 2061 patients), five on progression-free survival (in 1436 patients) and four on overall survival (in 1374 patients). The trials were generally old (conducted between late 1980s and early 1990s) and were of modest quality.
Based on the data from these trials, 25.8% of the patients in the TOR group responded to the treatment, compared with 26.9% in the TAM group. The cancers of 50% of the patients in the TOR group had progressed after 6.1 months, compared with 5.8 months in the TAM group. Half of the patients in the TOR group survived longer than 27.8 months, compared with 27.6 months in the TAM group. The risk for progression and death in the TOR group was not significantly different from that in the TAM group. The frequencies of most adverse events were also similar in the two groups, except that the number of headaches occurring in the TOR group was only about one-seventh of that in the TAM group. However, considering the results of other large trials, we cannot exclude the possibility that this is purely a play of chance. Due to the lack of data, no conclusions can be made as to the long-term adverse effects achieved with either treatment.
The evidence from this review suggests that TOR and TAM are equally effective and the safety profile of the former is at least not worse than the latter in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer. Thus, TOR may serve as a reasonable alternative to TAM when anti-oestrogens are applicable but TAM is not the preferred choice for some reason.
This review aimed to examine whether specialist paediatric home-based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses reduce the number of hospital admissions and length of stay, enhance health care in the community and reduce stress for families at the time of their child's illness. It is an update of our original review published in 2006. We found seven relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of total of 840 children aged from birth to 18 years with acute and/or chronic illnesses receiving either specialist home-based nursing services or conventional health care. The outcomes included use of health care services, physical and mental health, satisfaction, adverse health outcomes and costs. We decided not to combine the results of these RCTs because of the variety in types of services provided, types of participants and the outcome measures used. The results of individual RCTs show improved satisfaction with home-based care with no adverse impact on physical health outcomes for children. There is some evidence that specialist home-based nursing services reduce the length of hospital stay; however, there is no evidence that it leads to a reduction in use of hospital services. Further trials are required, measuring health, satisfaction, service use and long-term costs.
We searched for evidence on 9 May 2022, and identified 18 trials. We checked all trials for trustworthiness and did not include trials where we had doubts. We included 11 trials (2494 women and 2762 babies). One of these trials included over 1500 babies, finished in 2013 and was at low risk of bias. The other trials were smaller, older and at moderate or high risk of bias.
Nine trials compared the two corticosteroids most commonly used before early birth, dexamethasone and betamethasone. For the mother, while there may be no difference between these medicines, we could not rule out the possibility that the risk of both infection and side effects were lower with dexamethasone (moderate-quality evidence). For the baby, we are unsure whether the choice of medicine make a difference to the risk of any death after the start of the trial (moderate-quality evidence). The choice of medicine probably  makes little or no difference to the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (high-quality evidence) and chronic lung disease (moderate-quality evidence). We found that there may be little or no difference between dexamethasone and betamethasone in the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether the choice of medicine makes a difference to the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (inflammation of the small and large intestines), because this happened so rarely in the trials (low-quality evidence).
One large trial attempted to monitor all children longer term, reporting results when children were two years of age. This trial found that overall there is probably little or no difference in the risk of neurodevelopmental disability (illnesses that affect how the brain functions) at two years of age (moderate-quality evidence). The choice of medicine may make little or no difference to specific developmental outcomes including  hearing impairment (moderate-quality evidence), developmental delay (moderate-quality evidence) or learning difficulties (moderate-quality evidence). It is unclear whether the choice of medicine makes a difference to sight impairment (low-quality evidence). We are also unsure whether dexamethasone increases the risk of cerebral palsy (a group of disorders that affect the ability to move and maintain balance and posture) because there were  few events in the one study looking at this. We need information from more children to accurately assess the differences between these medicines for this outcome (low-quality evidence).
Three trials compared different ways of giving corticosteroids. One trial compared two ways of giving dexamethasone (by mouth or injection into the muscle), another trial compared different preparations of betamethasone and a third trial compared two ways of giving betamethasone (different time intervals between doses). Because these trials were small and at moderate risk of bias, we do not know whether their findings give a good indication of how best to give these medicines. Although we found that the effects of dexamethasone and betamethasone are probably similar for many outcomes, we are not sure which is the best corticosteroid in the context of early birth. We found no trials that reported the effects of these medicines beyond two years of age, so we cannot comment on their long-term effect on the child's health.
We did not find much evidence on the best way to give corticosteroids, so we are unable to say whether one way might be better than another.
We need more studies to establish which is the best medicine and what is the best way to give it, and babies in these trials need to be monitored over a long period to see any effects on child and adult development.
We included 11 trials involving 808 participants in our review. The methodological quality of the included studies was variable and the quality of the evidence was low because the outcomes of interest were only reported by one or two studies. Sensitive methods such as venography or sonography were not always used to diagnose DVT and the CPM was applied differently across studies, varying in range of motion, duration of CPM per day and the number of days after the surgery. The incidence of DVT or VTE was not clearly different in the CPM group compared with the control group of participants. This review did not find enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to conclude that CPM reduces VTE.
Short-term studies produced mixed results, with just over half indicating that opioids might be better than a placebo. While intermediate-term studies all indicated that opioids were better than placebo, most studies were small, most were short, and none used methods known to be unbiased. All these features are likely to make effects of opioids look better in clinical trials than they are in clinical practice. We cannot say whether opioids are better than placebo for neuropathic pain over the long term. Side effects such as constipation, nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness were common, but not life-threatening.
We wanted to learn the best way to reduce reflux in babies and children. We wanted to see if medicines help infants and children to feel better (symptom scores), heal the oesophagus (which is checked by using endoscopy, where a tiny camera is put down the oesophagus), or lower the time the oesophagus is exposed to stomach acid. We also investigated whether the medicines were safe by considering the harmful or unwanted effects reported in the studies. We searched for studies testing gastro-oesophageal reflux medicines in babies and children. We included all studies comparing these medicines, or comparing them to an inactive medicine (placebo). We assessed results which are important to doctors, nurses, and parents, and performed our own analysis of the results. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 36 suitable studies (involving 2251 babies and children), conducted worldwide, with most in the USA. The largest study recruited 268 babies, the smallest, 16 children. Fifteen studies compared an active medicine to placebo; 8 compared one active medication to another; and 11 studies gave the same medication at different doses. We found useable outcome information in 14 of the 36 studies. The remaining studies either did not report outcomes we were interested in or did not report them in a way we could analyse. We could not combine the results of any studies because they were too different (in terms of how long they followed participants up and the outcomes they investigated) to use in a meaningful way.  There is no clear effect on symptoms or measured acidity (one measure is reflux index, which is the percentage of time in 24 hours the oesophagus is exposed to stomach acid) between babies given omeprazole or placebo. One study (30 babies) showed cry/fuss time went down from 287 to 201 minutes/day in the placebo group and 246 to 191 minutes/day in the omeprazole group. Reflux index changed in the omeprazole group from 9.9% to 1.0% in 24 hours, and in the placebo group from 7.2% to 5.3%. One study (76 babies) showed that omeprazole and ranitidine may have a similar benefit for symptoms after 2 weeks: symptom scores (higher scores mean worse symptoms) in the omeprazole group dropped from 51.9 to 2.4, and in the ranitidine group, from 47 to 2.5. In one study of 52 newborn babies, esomeprazole appeared to show no reduction in the number of symptoms (184.7 to 156.7) compared to placebo (183.1 to 158.3). None of the studies reported harmful events or results about changes to babies' oesophaguses. In children older than 1 year of age, no studies assessed medical treatment versus placebo. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which block stomach acid production, at different doses may provide little to no improvements in symptoms or oesophagus healing. In one study (127 children), both lower-weight and higher-weight children given rabeprazole at lower and higher doses had both minimal – probably unimportant – changes in symptom scores and endoscopic scores (which indicate whether healing of the oesophagus has occurred). Pantoprazole may or may not improve symptom scores in children aged 1 to 5 years by week 8: there was no difference between lower and higher dosing in one study (60 children). Studies investigating other medications did not report enough information for us to assess their results properly. We are not confident in the evidence, which was mainly based on single studies with few babies and children. Several studies had pharmaceutical company help with manuscript writing. The question of how best to treat children with disabilities, and whether any PPIs are better than other medicines remain. The evidence is current to 17 September 2022.
We searched scientific databases in December 2016 for studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of intravitreal therapy with anti-VEGF agents in preterm infants with ROP. We identified six randomised controlled trials involving 383 infants. Five trials compared intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab with conventional laser therapy. One trial compared intravitreal pegaptanib plus laser therapy with laser/cryotherapy alone. The results suggest that intravitreal anti-VEGF agents reduce the risk of refractive errors (high myopia) during childhood but do not reduce the risk of retinal detachment or recurrence of ROP when used alone. Intravitreal pegaptanib used in conjunction with laser therapy reduces the risk of retinal detachment. The effects on other critical outcomes, including delayed side effects such as stroke, are not known. Further studies are needed to assess these outcomes. We graded the quality of the evidence as very low or low for most of the key outcomes. Neonatal units in China, Czech Republic, Italy, Iran, Ireland, and USA.
We reviewed the efficacy, safety, clinical disease progression and immunologic (CD4 count/percentage) and virologic (plasma HIV RNA viral load) markers of PRO 140 for HIV-infected patients. We included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The evidence is current to April, 2014. These three RCTs were of unclear risk of bias, as the details of methodological items were not adequately reported. All patients in these three studies were adult HIV-infected patients, PRO 140 was adminstrated subcutaneous or intravenous infusion with different doses. These three studies adressed the immunologic (CD4 count/percentage) and virologic (plasma HIV RNA viral load) markers. There may be potential conflicts of interest in all studies, as some of the authors are current or past employees of Progenics Pharmaceuticals, the producer of PRO 140.
Our systematic review showed that PRO 140 may offer significant short-term dose-dependent HIV-1 RNA suppression with tolerable side effects. PRO 140 2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 162 mg weekly, 324 mg biweekly, and 324 mg weekly could reduce HIV-1 RNA levels and demonstrate antiviral response. And PRO 140 5 mg/kg showed greater change in CD4+ cell count on day eight. Headache, lymphadenopathy, diarrhoea, fatigue, hypertension, nasal congestion and pruritus were reported to be the most frequent adverse events. Even though available evidence from the three trials suggests that PRO 140 may be effective, the number of patients in these three studies was very small, and the results of these three studies may be influenced by potential biases. So the quality of the evidence from available RCTs was low.
PRO 140 has been granted fast-track approval status by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but the efficacy of PRO 140 still needs to be proven in large, long-term high quality RCTs. The three studies reviewed here only evaluated the short-term (58 or 59 days) efficacy. The long-term efficacy was not evaluated, and adverse events data were not reported adequately for each group. So any recommendations cannot yet be made for applying this evidence. Whether PRO 140 could be used in clinical practice as first-line treatment for HIV-infected patients or not depends on the results of high quality future RCTs.
Major depression, also known as major depressive disorder or unipolar depression, is a common mental disorder characterised by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a person's ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy pleasurable activities. An episode of major depression may occur only once in a person's lifetime, but more often, it recurs throughout a person's life.
Antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first-line treatment for major depression in primary and secondary care settings. Milnacipran, a dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care in some countries. This systematic review investigated the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran compared to that of other antidepressive agents in the acute phase treatment of major depression. A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (2277 participants) were included in this review. When we brought together the results of approximately 2000 patients, we were unable to say whether milnacipran is better, worse or the same when compared to other antidepressive agents used in practice in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. However, there is some evidence that fewer people taking milnacipran stop taking the drug ('drop out') due to side effects and fewer people taking milnacipran experience side effects such as sleepiness, dry mouth or constipation than do people who take tricyclic antidepressants.
The studies varied in the definition of early initiation and late initiation of epidural analgesia. Early initiation is typically defined as with cervical dilatation of less than 4 cm to 5 cm, and late initiation with cervical dilatation of 4 cm to 5 cm or more. The dose, concentration and technique of epidural analgesia also varied between the studies. The groups randomised to receive late initiation of epidural analgesia differed in the analgesia they received before the epidural analgesia.
We searched for studies that used lactoferrin supplementation feeds to treat babies with infection or gastrointestinal injury. We did not find any studies on lactoferrin supplementation with antibiotics in treating babies with sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. It is unlikely that lactoferrin will be used for treatment of infection or intestinal inflammation in preterm babies because it has not been found effective to prevent these illnesses. During infection and intestinal problems feeds are usually not given. We do not recommend studies be done in the future to address this issue. This could not be assessed as no eligible studies were identified.
We included four trials (70 participants), two of which were performed in children and two in both children and adults. The trials looked at the effects of drugs (megestrol acetate and cyproheptadine hydrochloride) compared to a placebo (a tablet that contained no medicine) to stimulate appetite. The trials lasted between three and six months. We found that these drugs may improve weight and appetite in the short term (up to six months). No effect was seen on lung function. All stimulants can have adverse effects which can worsen cystic fibrosis, such as effects on blood sugar control, fatigue, mood, fluid retention, the liver, and shortness of breath, but unfortunately insufficient reporting of side effects prevented a full understanding of their effects. The included trials were too small to show if megestrol acetate and cyproheptadine hydrochloride can improve weight and appetite safely.
Whilst there is evidence to suggest that appetite stimulants may improve weight and poor appetite in adults and children with cystic fibrosis, we believe more research is needed to identify appropriate ways of measuring appetite, and then to collect sound data from enough patients to find out if appetite stimulants can improve appetite safely in cystic fibrosis. We have low confidence in the results being able to show the true effectiveness of appetite stimulants. We came to this conclusion because although we think that most of the people taking part had the same chance of being in the appetite stimulant or placebo group, and no one could not tell the difference between the appetite stimulant or the placebo, there may be some bias due to the small numbers of participants in the studies, and because in two studies some participants withdrew without clear reasons being given. Another possible source of bias is that three studies did not report on all of their pre-planned outcomes.
We included four studies, with 823 participants in total, comparing exercise for increased-risk individuals against control or no treatment. Follow-up of patients ranged from 16 weeks to six months. No study assessed cardiovascular or all-cause mortality, or cardiovascular events as individual outcomes. One or more of the studies reported on total cardiovascular risk, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index, exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life, but the results did not provide conclusive evidence of the effects of exercise in this population. The included studies did not assess smoking cessation or any adverse effects of the exercise intervention. We conclude that the evidence to date is entirely limited to small studies in terms of sample size, short-term follow-up, and high-risk of methodological bias, which makes it difficult to derive any conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the exercise carried out in the included trials on total cardiovascular risk, mortality, or cardiovascular events. It is necessary to conduct high-quality clinical trials that evaluate the effect of exercise on people with increased cardiovascular risk.
We wanted to find out whether disulfiram can help people with cocaine dependence reduce their cocaine use or stop using cocaine altogether. We also wanted to know whether treatment with disulfiram was acceptable and safe for people with cocaine dependence. We searched thoroughly for randomised studies (where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing disulfiram with no medicines, placebo (dummy treatment), or other medicines.
We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as methods and precision of the results of each study. We found 13 studies, which enroled 1191 people with cocaine dependence. The average duration of treatment was about three months. Twelve studies compared disulfiram with placebo or no pharmacological treatment, and three studies compared disulfiram with naltrexone (a medicine used to treat people with alcohol dependence or opioid dependence). Disulfiram compared with placebo may increase the number of people who are not using cocaine at the end of treatment, but may have little or no effect on the frequency of cocaine use (number of days or weeks of cocaine use at the end of treatment), the amount of cocaine use (weight of cocaine used or money spent on cocaine at the end of treatment), the number of people who achieve and maintain abstinence for at least three weeks, and the number of people who prematurely interrupt the treatment. We are unsure if disulfiram has any unwanted effects in people with cocaine addiction.
Disulfiram compared with naltrexone may decrease the frequency of cocaine use but may have little or no effect on the amount of cocaine use or on the number of people who prematurely interrupt treatment. We cannot be sure that the studies allocated people to groups appropriately, as most studies did not describe this process in detail.
There were important variations in the characteristics of the people included in the studies: some had additional substance use disorders, some were using other medicines, and some were receiving other psychosocial treatments.
In addition, most people included in the studies were men, and 11 of the 13 studies took place in the USA. Therefore, our results may not apply to women or people living in other countries. ?
This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.
In November 2015 we searched for as many studies as possible that both had a randomised controlled design and looked at the use of an antibiotic or antiseptic in participants with surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. We found 11 studies which included a total of 886 participants.These all looked at different comparisons. Several different types of wounds were included. Studies looked at wounds after diabetic foot amputation, pilonidal sinus surgery, treatment of various types of abscess, surgery for haemorrhoids, complications after caesarean section and healing of openings created by operations such as colostomy.
Most studies compared a range of different types of antibacterial treatments to treatments without antibacterial activity, but four compared different antibacterial treatments. Although some of the trials suggested that one treatment may be better than another, this evidence was limited by the size of the studies and the ways they were carried out and reported. All of the studies had low numbers of participants and in some cases these numbers were very small. Many of the studies did not report important information about how they were carried out, so it was difficult to tell whether the results presented were likely to be true. More, better quality, research is needed to find out the effects of antimicrobial treatments on surgical wounds which are healing by secondary intention.
Assessed as up to date November 2015.
This updated Cochrane review included 11 studies involving 753 participants. The studies compared maternal (mother) and neonatal (foetal) outcomes when pregnant women received extra oxygen versus room air. Oxygen was given to the women in different ways (at any flow rate or concentration via any oxygen delivery device). Overall, the results of this updated review reach the same conclusions as the original published review. None of the 11 included trials reported maternal desaturation. No differences were noted in routine measures of foetal wellbeing (Apgar scores) when mothers who received extra oxygen were compared with those who did not. The pregnant women receiving extra oxygen in comparison with room air had significantly higher oxygen saturation (three trials) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (five trials), as well as a significantly higher partial pressure of oxygen in both the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein (eight and 11 trials, respectively). Two trials reported higher markers of free radicals (perhaps indicating stress from excess oxygen) in mothers and foetuses when extra oxygen was given, but this is of no clinical significance Overall, we found no convincing evidence that giving oxygen in this situation is either beneficial or harmful for either the mother or the foetus. None of the 11 studies focused on maternal changes in oxygen saturation (defined as maternal saturation less than 90%). We graded the quality of evidence as low for the primary outcome (Apgar scores), and very low for the secondary outcomes (maternal oxygen saturation; partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein). The reasons for our grading were risk of bias and inconsistency of the results.
We searched scientific databases for clinical studies comparing ¹²³I-MIBG or 18F-FDG-PET imaging, or both, with microscopic examination of tissue suspected of neuroblastoma (histopathology). The evidence is current up to 11 September 2012.
We identified 11 eligible studies including 621 children that fulfilled our inclusion criteria: children < 18 years old with a neuroblastoma and ¹²³I-MIBG or 18F-FDG-PET imaging or both.
All studies included proven neuroblastoma. All 11 included studies had methodological limitations. Only one included study provided data on specificity (the ability of a test to correctly classify an individual as 'disease-free') and therefore we could not perform all of the planned analyses. When compared to histopathological results the sensitivity (the ability of a test to correctly classify an individual person as 'diseased') of ¹²³I-MIBG imaging varied from 67% to 100% in patients with histologically proven neuroblastoma. This means that in 100 children with proven neuroblastoma ¹²³I-MIBG imaging will correctly identify 67 to 100 of the neuroblastoma cases. Only one study, that reported on a lesion level, provided data to calculate the specificity (the ability of a test to correctly classify an individual as 'disease-free'): 68% in 115 lesions. This means that of 100 disease-free lesions in patients with proven neuroblastoma ¹²³I-MIBG imaging will correctly identify 68 lesions. So, in about 10% of the cases the neuroblastoma is not visible on ¹²³I-MIBG imaging (false negative results). For these cases, it is advisable to perform an additional test like 18F-FDG-PET imaging, but to be certain of its clinical value, more evidence is needed.
Only one included study reported on false positive findings. This means that ¹²³I-MIBG imaging and 18F-FDG-PET imaging incorrectly identified neuroblastoma lesions in patients which might result in wrongly classifying a patient with metastatic disease. It is important to keep in mind that false positive findings can occur, although more research is needed before definitive conclusions can be made.
We could not determine the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG-PET imaging, in case the neuroblastoma was incorrectly not identified with ¹²³I-MIBG, due to limited data. Also, we could not calculate the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG-PET imaging for detecting a neuroblastoma and compare this to ¹²³I-MIBG imaging because of the limited available data.
We wanted to find out if probiotics prevent acute URTIs in people of all ages with a healthy immune system. We searched for studies that investigated probiotics for URTIs. We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 24 studies. We analysed data from 6950 people, including children (aged from 1 month to 11 years old), adults (mean age 37.3 years), and older people (mean age 84.6 years) from Italy, Japan, the United States, Croatia, England, Finland, Sweden, Chile, China, Denmark, Germany, Thailand, and Turkey. It was not clear in which countries two trials were conducted. Most of the studies were conducted in the community, care facilities, schools, and hospitals for three months during the winter/spring. Probiotics were more likely to be given with milk-based food in children, in powder form in adults, and with milk-based food or capsules in the elderly. One or two strains (e.g. Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9, Lactobacillus paracasei (8700:2 or N1115)) and 109 or 1011 colony-forming units (CFU)/day of probiotics were used in most of the studies. Probiotics may reduce the number of people diagnosed with at least one URTI by about 24%; likely reduce the number of people diagnosed with at least three URTIs by about 41%; may reduce the incidence rate (number of new cases during a specified period of time) of acute URTIs by about 18%; may reduce the mean duration of an episode of acute URTIs by about 1.22 days; likely reduce the number of people who used antibiotics for URTIs by about 42%; and may not increase the number of people who experienced side effects (any harm). Evidence showing a decrease in the number of people absent from childcare centre, school, or work due to acute URTIs with probiotics was very uncertain. We are moderately confident that probiotics decrease the number of people diagnosed with at least three URTIs and the number of people who used antibiotics for URTIs, and have low confidence in the evidence that probiotics decrease the number of people diagnosed with at least one URTI, the incidence rate of acute URTIs, the mean duration of an episode of acute URTIs, and increase the number of people who experienced side effects (any harm). Evidence showing a decrease in the number of people absent from childcare centre, school, or work due to acute URTIs with probiotics was very uncertain. The main reasons for the limitations of the evidence were that people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The evidence is current to 10 May 2022.
Results from clinical studies on drugs and medical devices affect how doctors practice medicine and thereby the treatments offered to patients. However, clinical research is increasingly sponsored by companies that make these products, either because the companies directly perform the studies, or fully or partially fund them. Previous research has found that pharmaceutical industry sponsored studies tend to favor the sponsors’ drugs more than studies with any other sources of sponsorship. This suggests that industry sponsored studies are biased in favor of the sponsor’s products.
This review is an update of a previous review that looked at sponsorship of drug and device studies. The primary aim of the review was to find out whether the published results and overall conclusions of industry sponsored drug and device studies were more likely to favor the sponsors’ products, compared with studies with other sources of sponsorship. The secondary aim was to find out whether such industry sponsored studies used methods that increase the risk of bias, again compared with studies with other sources of sponsorship. In this update, we carried out a comprehensive search of all relevant papers of empirical studies published from 2010 to February 2015 and included 27 new papers, yielding a total of 75 papers included in our review.
Industry sponsored drug and device studies more often had efficacy results that were favorable to the sponsors' products, (risk ratio (RR): 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17 to 1.37), similar harms results (RR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.64 to 2.93) and favorable overall conclusions (RR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.51), compared with non-industry sponsored drug and device studies. We did not find a difference between industry and non-industry sponsored studies with respect to standard methodological factors that may increase the risk of bias, except for blinding: industry sponsored studies reported satisfactory blinding more often than non-industry sponsored studies. In industry sponsored studies, there was less agreement between the results and the conclusions than in non-industry sponsored studies, RR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.70 to 0.98).We did not find a difference between drug and device studies in the association between sponsorship and conclusions. Our analysis suggests that industry sponsored drug and device studies are more often favorable to the sponsor’s products than non-industry sponsored drug and device studies due to biases that cannot be explained by standard 'Risk of bias' assessment tools.
We found five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that studied a total of 833 participants; one was a very small pilot study of seven participants. Four studies involved patients with AVGs; there was only one study of AVFs. The outcomes were measured over a period of six or 12 months. There were reservations about the overall quality of all the studies, making us moderately to highly uncertain about the evidence. In AVF patients, we are moderately certain that fish oil supplements do not prevent blockage nor do they cause additional harm but the evidence only comes from one study. In AVG patients, we are very uncertain of the evidence for preventing blockage or causing serious harm, but there may be an increased risk of mild digestive side-effects such as a sensation of bloatedness, gas or a fishy aftertaste. There is limited high quality data on the benefits of omega-3 fish oil supplementation for preventing HD blockage in kidney failure patients. We did not find strong evidence that omega-3 fish oil supplements could prevent blockage of HD vascular access or that it increases the risk of serious and non-serious side-effects. All the evidence for preventing blockages come from just one or two studies, so more and better quality studies are needed.
We searched electronic databases and other sources up to June 2015 and found five relevant studies that reported the results for 368 adults with PFPS. Participants were recruited from health clinics in three studies and were military trainees in the other two studies. All five studies were small and at high risk of bias, which means that their findings may not be reliable.
The studies covered three different types of comparison: knee orthosis and exercises versus exercises alone; one type of orthosis versus another; and knee orthosis versus exercises. No study assessed the mode of knee orthosis use, such as whether the orthosis was worn all day or only during physical activity. All five trials compared a knee orthosis (either sleeve, brace or strap) plus exercise versus exercise alone. These provided very low quality evidence that wearing a knee orthosis made no difference to knee pain (data from three studies) and function (data from two studies). None of the three studies reported on quality of life, resource use or participant satisfaction. One study reported that both participants quitting military training due to knee pain were allocated a knee orthosis. One poorly reported study found over a third of knees had discomfort or skin abrasion in those given a knee sleeve.
Three studies provided very low quality evidence on single comparisons of different types of knee orthoses: a knee brace versus a knee sleeve (63 participants), a patella strap with a knee sleeve (31 participants), and a knee sleeve with a patellar ring versus a knee sleeve only (44 knees). None of three studies found an important difference between the two types of knee orthosis in knee pain. One study found no important difference in function between a knee brace and a knee sleeve. None of the three studies reported on quality of life, resource use or participant satisfaction. One study comparing a patella strap with a knee sleeve reported that both participants quitting military training due to knee pain were allocated a knee sleeve. One poorly reported study found three times as many knees with discomfort or skin abrasion in those given knee sleeves with a patella ring than those given knee sleeves only.
One study (66 participants) compared a knee orthosis (knee brace) with exercise. It provided very low quality evidence of no clinically important difference between the two intervention groups in pain or knee function. It did not report on other outcomes including complications. Overall, we found a lack of evidence to inform on the use of knee orthoses for treating PFPS. Our review found very low quality evidence from trials testing different knee orthoses (knee brace, sleeve and strap) that using a knee orthosis may not reduce knee pain or improve knee function in the short term (under three months) in adults who were also undergoing an exercise programme for treating PFPS. These findings point to the need for good-quality clinically-relevant research to inform on the use of commonly-available knee orthoses for treating PFPS.
We searched for evidence on 27 June 2017. We did not identify any randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared any type of exercise programme (plus standard care) for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes with 1) standard care alone, or 2) standard care plus another exercise programme. There is no evidence from RCTs to evaluate the effects of exercise interventions for improving mother and baby outcomes in women with pre-existing diabetes.
Good quality, large studies are urgently needed to find out if exercise interventions are safe, and if they improve health outcomes for pregnant women with diabetes and their babies. Future studies in this area could utilise the outcomes listed in this review, to improve consistency between trials in this area, and aid future analyses.
We found that compared to placebo, statin therapy reduced death and major heart-related events, with one in 13 people receiving statin therapy avoiding heart-related events and one in 26 people avoiding death. Statin therapy probably had little or no effect on stroke and kidney failure (when people would benefit from dialysis or a kidney transplant). The benefits of statin therapy were also evident in patients with CKD but not heart disease. Statins have some potential harms; however, we found there was probably no effect on cancer, liver function or withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events. There was limited reporting of muscle damage in the studies.
Studies did not identify a preferred type or dose of statin in treating people with CKD not requiring dialysis. Statins decrease death, major cardiovascular events, and myocardial infarction in people with moderate CKD. Limited data related to treatment toxicity resulted in uncertain effects. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials on hyperbaric oxygen therapy in adults with moderate to severe Bell's palsy. Our searches revealed no trials that met the inclusion criteria for the review. We found very low quality evidence from one trial to suggest that hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be beneficial for moderate to severe Bell's palsy. The trial involved 79 participants and compared hyperbaric oxygen therapy to prednisone, a corticosteroid, which is a proven active treatment. The participants did not know which treatment they were being given. Those treated with hyperbaric oxygen recovered more quickly and recovered normal facial movement more often (95% versus 76%). All participants tolerated the treatment well, and there were no major complications. The quality of evidence from this trial was very low because the assessors of facial function were aware of which treatment each participant had been given, which introduces a high risk of bias. There is therefore no high quality evidence on which to base conclusions about the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in Bell's palsy.
We searched scientific databases for studies that looked at the effects of high-concentration capsaicin in adults who had moderate or severe neuropathic pain. The treatment had to have effects measured for at least 8 weeks. The evidence is current to June 2016.
Eight studies satisfied our inclusion criteria, including two new studies for this update. The studies were well conducted. In seven studies, involving 2442 participants, we found that the treatment gave good levels of pain relief to a small number of participants with some types of neuropathic pain (pain after shingles, and nerve injury pain associated with HIV infection), and probably also in another type (painful feet because of damaged nerves caused by diabetes). About 4 in 10 people had at least moderate pain relief with capsaicin compared with 3 in 10 with control. The control was a treatment that looked the same but did not contain high levels of capsaicin, with either nothing added, or very small amounts of capsaicin added. In one small study (46 participants) in people with persistent pain after hernia surgery, it did not seem better than control.
In all people who have this treatment there can be short-lived localised skin problems such as redness, burning, or pain. Serious problems seem to be uncommon, and were no more frequent in these trials with high-concentration capsaicin than with control using very low-concentration capsaicin or placebo.
Slightly more people treated with control rather than capsaicin dropped out of the studies because of lack of benefit, but there was no difference between the groups for drop-outs because of side effects. We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate or very low for pain relief outcomes, mainly because only a small number of studies and moderate number of participants provided information for each outcome. We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate for harmful effects. Moderate quality means that further research may change the result. Very low quality means we are very uncertain about the results.
This review compares the effects of zotepine to other second generation antipsychotic drugs. Three trials suggest that the efficacy of zotepine may be comparable to risperidone and remoxipride. The evidence base is insufficient to provide firm conclusions as to whether zotepine is as effective or less effective than clozapine. The movement disorders and the cognitive changes appear to be similar to clozapine, risperidone and remoxipride. The need for antiparkinson medication is similar to risperidone and remoxipride, but may be associated with increased need than necessary with clozapine.
Among the pertinent medical literature only  two studies, comprising  a total of 123 participants,  met the criteria of the methodological quality necessary for their inclusion in this review. Taking into account  the disability progression, the analysis of the data showed that INF beta treatment in  patients with PPMS was  not associated with a reduction of  this parameter during the first two years of therapy. Adverse effects, mainly flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions, occurred frequently and were the same as  reported by the many studies on   IFN beta treatments in MS patients with different types of the disease.
It is worth nothing that the patients’ population analysed was too small to allow a definitive conclusion on the efficacy of IFN beta therapy  in PPMS.
The review identified 524 potentially relevant articles. Only five randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria, and these compared oestrogen with placebo in a total of 305 women who were clinically diagnosed with PMS. We found very low quality evidence to suggest that oral unopposed oestrogen given in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is probably ineffective for controlling the symptoms of PMS and may even make them worse. There was very low quality evidence to support the effectiveness of continuous oestrogen (in the form of transdermal patches or subcutaneous implants) plus progestogen, with a small to moderate effect size. A comparison between 200 microgram and 100 microgram doses of continuous oestrogen was inconclusive with regard to effectiveness but suggested that the lower dose was less likely to cause side effects. Uncertainty remains regarding safety, as the identified studies were too small to provide definite answers. Moreover, none of the included trials addressed adverse effects that might occur beyond the typical trial duration of 2 to 8 months. This suggests the choice of oestrogen dose and mode of administration could be based on an individual woman’s preference and modified according to the effectiveness and tolerability of the chosen regimen. The overall quality of the evidence for all comparisons was graded as very low, mainly due to risk of bias in the included studies, imprecision (due to small sample sizes) and differences between the studies.
We searched the literature in January 2018. We found two studies, enrolling 157 participants in total, that tested the effect of systemic corticosteroids on breathlessness in adults with cancer, compared to a dummy medicine (placebo). One study lasted seven days, and the other study lasted 15 days. Both studies compared a corticosteroid (oral (by mouth) dexamethasone) to a dummy medicine with no properties to reduce breathlessness, which we included in our analyses.
We were interested in the primary outcomes of participant-reported breathlessness intensity, quality and burden. We were also interested in the secondary outcomes of serious side effects, participant satisfaction with treatment and participant withdrawal from trial. We could not complete many of our planned analyses due to the small number of studies, the different medicines and comparisons, and outcomes that the studies reported. We did conduct one analysis of 114 participants to assess change in breathlessness intensity/relief from baseline. We found that corticosteroids had no beneficial effect compared to a dummy medicine on reducing breathlessness intensity in people with cancer.
We found that the frequency of side effects was similar between groups, and corticosteroids were generally well tolerated. None of the studies measured participant satisfaction with treatment. Participant withdrawals were 15% and 36% in the two studies. The current evidence was based on only two studies with a small number of participants. We rated the quality of the evidence from these studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. We judged the quality of the evidence in this review to be very low, downgraded due to problems with study quality and too few data. We are very uncertain of the results. More high-quality studies are needed to determine if corticosteroids are effective for dyspnoea in people with cancer.
We found six studies randomising a total of 9379 patients who have early CKD (stages 1 to 3 only, without diabetes). Patients were 18 to 75 years old, 79% were males, most had high blood pressure and were from China, Europe, Japan, and the USA.
All six studies were considered to be at a high risk of bias. This was due to poorly described trial methods, not all of the patients were kept blind to their treatments, and there were high numbers of participants dropping out. Five out of the six studies were funded by the drug manufacturer or by an agency with a commercial interest in the results of the studies, one study did not declare their source of funding.
1. Benazepril or trandolapril may reduce the chance of death, having a stroke, myocardial infarction, and side effects, but may or may not reduce the chance of congestive heart failure or transient ischaemic attack.
2. Losartan may or may not reduce the chance of death, side effects or the presence of proteinuria and may not improve kidney function (eGFR) or blood pressure.
3. Enalapril, perindopril, or trandolapril may or may not be any better than olmesartan, losartan, or candesartan for proteinuria and blood pressure. There is not enough evidence to know whether blood pressure-lowering medications work well in patients with early CKD (stages 1 to 3) who do not have diabetes. We also do not know which type of blood pressure-lowering medication is better than another.
The quality and certainty of the evidence is considered to be very low. This is due to a high risk of bias in the studies, poorly conducted methods, and too little data from too few patients. We have identified an area of large uncertainty for further research.
This review was published in 2015, and updated in 2017. We found 68 randomized controlled studies (RCTs), (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), with results from a total of 4525 participants. RCTs are used because they provide the most reliable evidence.
Intravenous lidocaine was compared with placebo or standard care in 66 of the studies, and with thoracic (chest area of spine) epidural analgesia in two studies. (A placebo is an inactive substance or procedure given to a participant in a medical trial to compare its effects with those of a real drug or other intervention). Lidocaine infusion was started during the surgery, before the first cut, and continued to at least the end of surgery. The included studies were moderately well conducted. We are uncertain whether lidocaine infusion reduces pain, one to four hours after surgery when compared to placebo or usual care (29 studies, over 1600 participants). There was probably no difference in pain at 24 hours (33 studies, 1847 participants) and at 48 hours (24 studies, 1404 participants) between participants in the lidocaine and the placebo group. We are uncertain whether lidocaine infusion improves recovery of bowel function, with a reduction in the time to first defaecation or bowel movements (12 studies, 684 participants), and reduced risk of stopping the passage of food in the gut (4 studies, 273 participants). We are also uncertain whether lidocaine reduces postoperative nausea (35 studies, 1903 participants), and the requirement for opioids for pain relief (40 studies, 2201 participants). Only a limited number of studies systematically analysed adverse effects of intravenous lidocaine infusion. The side effects of intravenous lidocaine were unclear.
In the two studies that investigated intravenous lidocaine compared to epidural analgesia (102 participants), the effect on pain at 24 and 48 hours, and on the time to first bowel movement, remains unclear. The effect of lidocaine on the risk of stopping the passage of food in the gut and for postoperative nausea is also unclear, as only one small trial assessed these outcomes. Neither study investigated the effect on pain immediately after surgery, or on opioid consumption. Both studies looked at adverse effects associated with lidocaine, but the effect is uncertain. We rated the quality of evidence for most outcomes as very low. This was because of inconsistent findings across studies and the fact that the evidence came from small studies that were of moderate design quality or a limited number of studies. The quality of the evidence for minimal or no effect on pain at 24 and 48 hours was moderate quality. The studies involved a variety of surgical procedures. The dose of lidocaine used, and how long it was delivered for after the end of surgery, also varied between studies.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are commonly used for treating low-back pain. This review found 65 studies (including over 11,000 patients) of mixed methodological quality that compared various NSAIDs with placebo (an inactive substance that has no treatment value), other drugs, other therapies and with other NSAIDs. The review authors conclude that NSAIDs are slightly effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica (pain and tingling radiating down the leg). In patients with acute sciatica, no difference in effect between NSAIDs and placebo was found.
The review authors also found that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs (paracetamol/acetaminophen, narcotic analgesics, and muscle relaxants). Placebo and paracetamol/acetaminophen had fewer side effects than NSAIDs, though the latter has fewer side effects than muscle relaxants and narcotic analgesics. The new COX-2 NSAIDs do not seem to be more effective than traditional NSAIDs, but are associated with fewer side effects, particularly stomach ulcers. However, other literature has shown that some COX-2 NSAIDs are associated with increased cardiovascular risk.
The review noted a number of limitations in the studies. Only 42% of the studies were considered to be of high quality. Many of the studies had small numbers of patients, which limits the ability to detect differences between the NSAID and the control group. There are few data on long term results and long-term side effects.
We summarized medical literature regarding the effect of two to six days of oral antibiotics (short duration) in treating children with streptococcal throat infection, compared with 10 days of oral penicillin (standard duration). We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis. The short duration treatment resulted in better compliance but more side effects. All side effects were self-limiting: mostly mild to moderate diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Three studies reported the rate of long duration complications with no statistically significant difference.
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, only 3 out of the 20 included studies followed the participants for a sufficient duration to be able to study the prevalence of complications of GABHS pharyngitis. Although these three studies had a total of 8135 participants, results were too under-powered to draw any conclusions on differences in complication rates. This means our conclusion is not applicable in low-income countries where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is high. Another limitation is that the primary studies evaluated different antibiotics for variable durations (three to six days). Also, studies were of limited quality. Finally, although the shorter antibiotic duration appeared to be effective and more convenient, it is more expensive than the standard duration 10 days of penicillin. However, one must take into account the reality of patient behavior and the price of unsuccessful or incomplete therapy.
Three to six days of oral antibiotics for children with streptococcal throat infection is a safe treatment with a comparable effect to the standard duration of 10 days of penicillin. However, our results must be interpreted with caution in low-income countries where acute rheumatic fever is still a problem.
We included 13 randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) involving a total of 1132 women assigned to receive either metformin (570) or placebo (dummy treatment)/no treatment (563). The evidence is current to 13 February 2020. We divided the analysis by type of ovarian stimulation protocol used during the IVF treatment (long GnRH-agonist or short GnRH-antagonist) to determine whether the type of stimulation used influenced the outcomes. We are uncertain of the effect of metformin using long protocol GnRH-agonist on live birth rates compared with placebo or no treatment, but metformin may increase clinical pregnancy rate with this type of ovarian stimulation protocol. Metformin may reduce the incidence of OHSS. We estimated that for a woman with a 28% chance of achieving a live birth (long protocol GnRH-agonist) following placebo or no treatment, the chance following metformin would be between 27% and 51%. For a woman with a 28% chance of achieving a clinical pregnancy in long protocol GnRH-agonist without metformin, the chance using metformin would be between 30% and 45%.
For the short protocol GnRH-antagonist, metformin may reduce live birth rate, and we are uncertain of its effect on clinical pregnancy and OHSS rates compared with placebo/no treatment.
Overall, metformin may reduce the incidence of OHSS when compared with placebo/no treatment. For a woman with a 20% risk of OHSS without metformin, the corresponding risk using metformin would be between 6% and 14%. Side effects (mostly gastrointestinal) may be more common with metformin. We are uncertain of the effect of metformin on miscarriage rates when compared with placebo/no treatment. The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcomes live birth rate and incidence of OHSS was low. We assessed the evidence as low for the secondary outcomes clinical pregnancy rate (long protocol GnRH-agonist), miscarriage rate, and side effects, and very low for clinical pregnancy rate (short protocol GnRH-antagonist). The main limitations were risk of bias and imprecise results. This updated review on metformin versus placebo/no treatment before or during IVF/ICSI treatment in women with PCOS found no clear evidence that metformin improves live birth rates: the effect of metformin is uncertain using long protocol GnRH-agonist, but live birth rates may be reduced using short protocol GnRH-antagonist. Metformin may increase clinical pregnancy rates using long protocol GnRH-agonist, but we are uncertain of the effect using short protocol GnRH-antagonist. Metformin may reduce the incidence of OHSS, but may result in a higher incidence of side effects. We are uncertain of the effect of metformin on miscarriage rate.
We reviewed all the available trial evidence to see whether drains help or hinder recovery after operations for incisional hernia repair. We found that no trials that compared people who had drains inserted for this type of surgery against those who did not. One trial compared two types of drain against each other, and both models of drain performed similarly well. Further trials need to be carried out before being able to answer the question about the benefits, or otherwise, of drains inserted during repair of incisional hernias.
These findings, however, are limited by the relatively short-term of clinical controlled observations which in all studies but one lasted for no more than three months. Subjective evaluations of these patients as given by their doctors were consistently positive and no noticeable side effects were evidenced in the various studies over the years.
We identified nine trials including 973 people. We found that people were less likely to have bacteria in their urine after urodynamic studies if they had antibiotics (4% versus 12%). While they did have fewer urinary tract infections (20% compared with 28% with no antibiotics), this did not reach statistical significance. There were too few adverse effects, such as fever, pain when passing urine or a reaction to the antibiotics, for the findings to be reliable. However, people were less likely to have blood in their urine with antibiotics. There was no information about other treatments which might help reduce infections, nor about different doses or types of antibiotics.
Two relevant trials with 167 patients were identified. The limited data suggest that a gland specific lower dosage of radioiodine treatment is potentially effective for pediatric GD, but a significant higher incidence of hypothyroidism compared with ATD was observed. However, all of the analysed studies were of low quality. No trial evaluated mortality, health related quality of life, economic outcomes or compliance with treatments.
We wanted to find out if taking daily iron supplements (either alone or with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals) during pregnancy would improve the health and nutrition of pregnant women and their babies. We searched for studies that examined the effects of daily iron supplementation during pregnancy (either alone or with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 57 trials involving 48,971 women in this review (40 studies on daily oral iron supplementation compared to placebo/no iron and eight comparing iron with folic acid compared to placebo/no iron and folic acid).
The largest study was amongst 18,775 participants and the smallest study was amongst 13 participants. The trials were conducted in 27 countries around the world; most studies were done in the United Kingdom (14) and United States of America (eight). Studies were mainly funded by government agencies, universities, health ministries within countries, and pharmaceutical companies.
Iron supplementation compared to placebo or no iron
Women taking iron supplements during pregnancy may have reduced anaemia, iron deficiency, and probably reduced iron-deficiency anaemia when they give birth around their due date. There is probably little to no difference in the risk of other maternal outcomes, including maternal death; however, the evidence is very uncertain for adverse effects, or severe anaemia in the second or third trimester. No trials reported maternal clinical malaria or infection during pregnancy.
Women taking iron supplements during pregnancy were probably less likely to have infants with low birthweight (less than 2500 g), but the evidence is very uncertain for infant birthweight. There was probably little to no difference between groups for preterm birth and little to no difference in birth defects or death of a baby in the first 28 days of life.
Iron + folic acid compared to placebo or no iron + folic acid
Women taking daily iron + folic acid supplements probably had reduced anaemia or may have reduced iron deficiency when they gave birth around their due date; however, the evidence is very uncertain for iron-deficiency anaemia, or maternal death. The evidence is uncertain for any adverse effects, and the evidence is very uncertain for severe anaemia in the second or third trimester. No maternal deaths were reported, and no trials reported maternal clinical malaria.
Women taking iron + folic acid supplements during pregnancy probably had infants with increased birthweight, but there may be little to no difference between groups for other outcomes, including low infant birthweight (less than 2500 g), preterm birth, death of a baby in the first 28 days of life, or birth defects. Few studies reported the main outcomes, including maternal deaths, adverse effects, severe anaemia, maternal clinical malaria, or infection during pregnancy, and other infant outcomes, including birth defects, and infant iron status, growth, and development. In addition, studies included pregnant women at different iron levels and gestational age at enrolment with different doses of iron, and timing of outcome assessments, which constrains the comparability of evidence for some outcomes in pregnant women and children. This review is an update of the previous review. The evidence is up-to-date as of 18 January 2024.
We found six studies including a total of 597 people living with vascular dementia. The method of Cerebrolysin treatment differed across studies, with varying strengths of Cerebrolysin and treatment durations. The studies reported that Cerebrolysin had beneficial effects on memory and thinking and on daily functioning. There was no reported risk of side effects with treatment. None of the studies described quality of life of people living with vascular dementia or their caregivers.
Although the studies suggested a benefit of Cerebrolysin treatment, the results are not definitive. The included studies had several issues that may have led to misleading results. Even if the benefit reported in the studies is real, the effect was modest and may not be important to people living with dementia. There is a need for a large, well-conducted study to better understand if Cerebrolysin is a useful treatment for people living with vascular dementia.
After a wide search for studies, we identified four trials involving 139 participants in total that met our criteria for inclusion in the review. Three randomised controlled trials compared the three different non-antiepileptic drugs tizanidine, tocainide and pimozide with carbamazepine, which is the standard drug treatment. No new trials were identified for the update of this review in 2013. Tizanidine did not produce significantly more benefit than carbamazepine according to low-quality evidence. The reporting of the tocainide trial did not allow us to assess whether the drug helped the pain of trigeminal neuralgia, but studies that were not part of this review suggest that this treatment can have serious harmful effects on the blood. Side effects of pimozide were very common but there was low-quality evidence that it was more effective than carbamazepine. In a fourth trial there was low-quality evidence that proparacaine hydrochloride eye drops did not show any significant benefit.
There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to show significant benefit from non-antiepileptic drugs in trigeminal neuralgia. Further well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to establish whether non-antiepileptic drugs are beneficial in trigeminal neuralgia.
The searches for the review are up to date to May 2013.
Our systematic review found 19 studies involving 2256 children that use epinephrine for the treatment of bronchiolitis in acute care settings. When comparing epinephrine with placebo, no differences were found for length of hospital stay but there is some indication that epinephrine is effective for reducing hospital admissions. Exploratory results from one large, high-quality trial suggest that combined treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (dexamethasone) and epinephrine may significantly reduce admissions. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of epinephrine for the treatment of bronchiolitis among children admitted to the hospital.
The evidence shows no important differences in adverse effects with epinephrine over the short-term with long-term safety not being assessed. Some limitations of this review include the quality of the included studies and inconsistent timing of measurement across studies which limited the number of children included in some meta-analyses. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy, applicability and long-term safety of epinephrine as a treatment for bronchiolitis.
In summary, our systematic review provides evidence that epinephrine is more effective than placebo for bronchiolitis in outpatients. Recent research suggests combined epinephrine and steroids may be effective for outpatients. There is no evidence to support the use of epinephrine for inpatients.
This evidence is current to June 2016.
Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria, including 13 studies of probiotics and four studies of fibre interventions. We also found one study of a diet low in substances known as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and one study of a fructose-restricted diet.
All of the studies compared dietary interventions to a placebo or control. The trials were carried out in eight countries and included a total of 1453 participants, aged between five and 18 years. Most children were recruited from outpatient clinics. Most interventions lasted four to six weeks. Probiotics
We found evidence from 13 studies suggesting that probiotics might be effective in improving pain in the shorter term. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported, other than dry mouth in one study. We judged this evidence to be of moderate or low quality because some studies were small, showed varying results, or were at risk of bias.
Fibre supplements
We found no clear evidence of improvement of pain from four studies of fibre supplements. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported. There were few studies of fibre supplements, and some of these studies were at risk of bias. We judged this evidence to be of low quality.
Low FODMAP diets
We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of low FODMAP diets in children with RAP.
Fructose-restricted diets
We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of fructose-restricted diets in children with RAP. We found some evidence suggesting that probiotics may be helpful in relieving pain in children with RAP in the short term. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of the management strategy for RAP. Further trials are needed to find out how effective probiotics are over longer periods of time and which probiotics might work best.
We did not find convincing evidence that fibre supplements are effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Future larger, high-quality studies are needed to test the effectiveness of fibre and low FODMAP diet treatments.
We conducted a search on 14th May 2021. Our findings are based on 31 studies with a total of 5754 women and their babies.
Twelve studies involving 3129 women compared any type of forceps with any vacuum cup. Forceps were more likely to achieve vaginal birth, but with a greater number of perineal tears including those affecting the anus or rectum (both low-certainty evidence). The was no evidence of a difference in rates of postpartum haemorrhage (heavy bleeding after birth) between groups (low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of difference in the chances of low Apgar scores (a scoring system used to assess the baby's well-being at 1 and 5 minutes to determine how well they are coping after the birth) and low umbilical artery pH (blood test from the cord to assess the baby's oxygen levels immediately before birth) (both low-certainty evidence). Women who had forceps had higher pain relief requirements, although babies were less likely to be jaundiced.
Two small studies in 218 women compared low forceps to any vacuum cup, but most of the evidence was of very low certainty, so we could draw no meaningful conclusion.
Nine studies involving 1148 women compared rigid cups with soft cups and found that rigid cups may be more likely to result in a successful delivery (low-certainty evidence), whilst there is probably no evidence of a difference in the rates of perineal tears affecting the anus or rectum or postpartum haemorrhages (low- and moderate-certainty evidence). In addition there is no evidence of a difference in the rates of low Apgar and low umbilical artery pH (low-certainty evidence).
In four studies with a total of 962 women we found no evidence of difference in the chances of a failed delivery between the handheld vacuum-cup group compared to the standard vacuum-cup devices (low-certainty evidence). In addition there was no evidence of differences in the risk of maternal rectal tissue trauma (low-certainty evidence). Finally, there was no evidence of difference in the rates of postpartum haemorrhage, low umbilical artery pH or low Apgar between the two groups (low-certainty evidence). The decision on which instrument to use is multifactorial and needs to consider the skills and resources available and the urgency for the birth. The clinician needs to choose the instrument that is most likely to achieve a successful birth with the least trauma to the mother and baby.
We included 22 studies with 2223 men. The average age was 68.0 years. These men had mostly symptoms rated as moderate or severe. Naftopidil may have had similar effects on urinary symptoms and QoL compared to tamsulosin and silodosin. In terms of unwanted effects, naftopidil may have had similar unwanted sexual side effects compared to tamsulosin but have fewer compared to silodosin. The reliability of evidence for most symptoms was low. This means that the true effect may be substantially different from what this review shows.
This review questions the appropriateness of the common practice of using inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of children with cough and without any other evidence of asthma or any other chronic chest condition. The review found that there is currently no good evidence to suggest that treatment with standard doses of inhaled corticosteroids will be beneficial.
We included randomised controlled studies published up to June 2016.
We found 17 studies, with 3149 women who had just delivered by CS. In these studies, a group of women chewed gum and a second group did not, receiving usual care. The studies were conducted in nine countries (mostly low- to middle-income countries) and were different in many aspects. For instance, some studies included only women having their first baby and others included women with a previous CS; some studies included only elective (pre-scheduled) CS and others also included emergency CS. The way that gum was given also differed in the studies; in some the women started chewing gum right after the CS and in others they waited for up to 12 hours. Also, the women could not be blinded to receiving the gum. The combination of the results (in a meta-analysis) of these studies showed that the women who chewed gum after a CS had an earlier return of their bowel function. On average, they passed gas seven hours earlier (13 studies, 2399 women). This effect was consistent for first versus repeat CS, time spent chewing gum per day, early feeding versus nothing by mouth until the return of intestinal function, elective versus non-elective or emergency CS, and length of time after CS when gum-chewing was initiated. The quality of the evidence for this outcome was very low. The women chewing gum were at least half as likely to have 'ileus' (a combination of symptoms such as bloating, cramping, nausea, vomiting and inability to defecate) than the women who did not chew gum (four studies, 1139 women, low-quality evidence). Gum chewing reduced the time to first defecation to about nine hours earlier (11 studies, 2016 women, very low-quality evidence) and the time to hospital discharge by some eight hours (seven studies, 1489 women). Only three out of 925 women complained about having to chew gum and there were no reports of adverse effects associated with gum-chewing (eight studies, 925 women, low-quality evidence). None of the studies assessed women's satisfaction in relation to chewing gum.
The overall quality of the evidence was low to very low, mostly due to lack of blinding of the participants (the women knew they were chewing gum) and heterogeneity between the studies. The available evidence suggests that gum-chewing in the first 24 hours after a CS is a well-tolerated simple, low-cost, safe and easy intervention that enhances early recovery of bowel function, improves maternal comfort and potentially reduces hospital costs. Further research is necessary to establish the optimal regimen of gum-chewing (when to start, number and duration of sessions per day) to enhance bowel function recovery and to assess potential adverse effects and women's satisfaction with this intervention.
When we looked at the study in which people started out on average with no pain, or almost no pain, we could not be certain whether algorithm-based pain management had an effect on the intensity of pain they experienced during the study. This was true whether the study participants reported on their own pain or whether nurses judged pain intensity. We also could not tell from this study whether algorithm-based pain management reduced challenging behaviour.
For people who started out with mild to moderate pain, we found that, compared to education for nursing staff, algorithm-based pain management may have little or no effect on pain intensity reported by the people themselves (based on the results from one study). When the pain was rated by somebody else (a 'proxy', who was a nurse or research assistant), we found that algorithm-based pain management may be better than usual care, although it may not be more effective than pain education. However, it is difficult to be sure about the accuracy of pain ratings made by other people.
Our confidence in the results was limited because of the small number of included studies, the variation in the intensity of pain and in the severity of the participants' dementia at the start of the trials, and the quality of the studies.
No study looked for harmful effects, and no study described that any harmful effects occurred. We found no good evidence that introducing an algorithm to guide pain management for people with dementia in nursing homes is any better than education for nursing staff for reducing pain or challenging behaviours, but it may be better than usual care at reducing pain (rated by observers). The amount of evidence was small, and we could not be certain of the results. More research in this area would be valuable.
We wanted to find out whether extending the administration of blood thinners beyond the hospital stay would lower the risk of developing VTE and its associated dangers compared to its administration only during the hospital stay. We also sought to explore the unwanted effects related to extending the duration of blood thinners. We searched for studies that investigated extending blood thinners beyond the hospital stay in acutely ill medical patients and compared them to blood thinners only during hospitalization. We then summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as the respective study sizes and research methods. Our search yielded seven clinical trials, including 40,846 participants that addressed our review question. Most studies reported the outcomes in the short term (i.e. during the treatment period and within 45 days of hospitalization).
Extended-duration blood thinners, compared with standard-duration blood thinners, reduced the risk of short-term symptomatic VTE (i.e. VTE that manifests because of patient-reported symptoms). However, that benefit was counteracted by an increased risk of short-term major bleeding (e.g. requiring blood transfusion and/or associated with a severe drop in haemoglobin). There was little to no difference between either strategy in terms of death from any cause. Extended-duration blood thinners, compared with standard-duration blood thinners, resulted in a reduction of short-term total VTE (including those manifesting with and without symptoms, only discovered via routine testing/screening) and the composite outcome of fatal and irreversible vascular events (including non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal PE, death due to heart/lung causes, or stroke). However, there is likely little to no difference between either strategy in terms of fatal bleeding (significant bleeding resulting in death) or death due to VTE. When assessing for fatal bleeding and death related to VTE, the results from the studies varied widely. The evidence is up to date to March 2023.
We identified only one small, poorly reported, unpublished, randomised trial comparing benperidol with another antipsychotic. Unfortunately the quality of reporting is so poor that the results cannot be considered reliable. Although benperidol was first marketed in 1966, more trials on this drug are justified as with the advent of new compounds there is a danger that inexpensive drugs such as benperidol remain under-researched and overlooked.
The review found that there is modest evidence that MAB improves the chances of longer survival for men with advanced prostate cancer. However, there are also adverse effects of MAB treatment that may mean that it is not a suitable treatment for all men.
The present review looked at the available evidence for the effectiveness of open surgery compared with placing a stent in the coarctation of the thoracic aorta. The review authors searched the medical literature but they did not found any studies that compared open surgery and stent placement for the treatment of coarctation of the thoracic aorta. The treatment of CoA is a challenging procedure and the centers that perform this treatment have a well-established strategy for patients with CoA; the strategy is in accordance with the experience of involved professionals and local resources. In both situations experience and resources have improved the results of the treatment. However a more concrete and long-term analysis of these strategies is needed.
This review found some evidence for relief with progesterone but trials differed in route of administration, dose, duration of treatment and selection of women taking part. Outcomes also differed. The studies had flaws in methods or in handling outcome data or both.
Adverse effects which may or may not have been the result of the treatment were generally mild.
Further research would be needed to test claims for the effectiveness of higher doses of progesterone. They are neither refuted nor borne out as yet. Using each woman's own symptoms to select participants and to judge treatment effects would be more accurate than checklists of largely irrelevant symptoms. Knowing how many women had fewer days with symptoms, fewer or milder symptoms, or the converse, would be more valuable than the calculations based on subjective data for groups of women.
We found only one trial that assessed atorvastatin (a type of statin drug) and placebo (dummy treatment) in 60 adults with asthma over a period of 12 weeks. These people had chronic asthma (persistent airway disease) when they started treatment. We found that the statin (atorvastatin) did not result in any clear improvement in lung function in people with asthma, but may be better in asthma control than the dummy drug. However, because there is only one trial, we cannot draw firm conclusions.
The trial did not report on adverse effects or severe adverse effects (harms). We are uncertain whether statins may  have beneficial effects on relieving asthma or whether they may increase the risk of adverse events or non-serious adverse events. The evidence was of very low certainty, so we cannot draw firm conclusions about whether statins are helpful and safe to be used by people with asthma.
The evidence is current to 7 February 2020.
We wanted to discover whether colchicine alone or added to other medications is better or worse than alternative therapies in preventing pericarditis. We have reviewed all randomised controlled trials about the effect of colchicine in preventing recurrence of pericarditis in people with pericarditis. We found four trials involving 564 participants, who were followed up for at least 18 months. Two studies examined the use of colchicine in people with recurrent pericarditis and two examined the use of colchicine in people with a first episode of pericarditis. The evidence is current to August 2014.
The trials showed that people taking colchicine have a lower risk of developing pericarditis recurrence and a higher proportion experience symptom relief. It is expected that at 18 months, one pericarditis recurrence can be avoided for every four people receiving colchicine with NSAIDs rather than NSAIDs alone. Adverse effects were reported in all trials and affected 15 people (9%) of the 162 taking colchicine. Adverse effects included abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
Two studies were designed so that participants knew the type of intervention they were taking and people in the comparison group had no dummy pill. The results of these studies could exaggerate the effects of the drug.
The evidence suggests beneficial effects of colchicine in preventing recurrence of pericarditis, however this is based on a limited number of small trials. More trials are currently being done and we await their results to see if the benefits of colchicine can be further confirmed.
This review of trials assessed the effectiveness of artesunate compared with the standard treatment quinine. Eight trials involving 1664 adults and 5765 children were identified, from study sites in Asia and Africa.
Treating adults in Asia with artesunate instead of quinine would prevent an extra 94 deaths for every 1000 patients treated. In trials involving children, the proportion of deaths was lower than in the trials involving adults. This lower risk of death results in a smaller benefit in children than in adults, but would still save an extra 26 lives for every 1000 children treated.
In the children who survived their illness, there were more neurological problems at the time of hospital discharge in those treated with artesunate than those treated with quinine. However, the majority of these neurological problems had resolved when they were reviewed 28 days later, and at this timepoint there was no difference between the two treatment groups.
Artesunate should be the drug of choice for adults and children with severe malaria worldwide.
We wanted to find out how effective occlusal treatment is for people who have TMD when compared to no treatment or other treatments. We searched databases of research studies. We selected only randomised controlled studies as this type of study is the best type to ensure that groups of participants are similar and to evaluate if a treatment really works. In a randomised controlled study, people are assigned randomly to one treatment or another, or to a group receiving no treatment. Ideally, these studies are carried out 'blind', i.e. the healthcare professionals involved in the trial and the people taking part do not know who is in which group.
Our aim was to find studies that compared occlusal treatment for TMD versus no treatment or another treatment. We were interested in the effect on jaw-joint pain, muscle pain at rest and during movement, discomfort, frequency and intensity of clicking of jaw joints, recurrence of TMD after treatment, quality of life, and satisfaction.
We used standard Cochrane methods to search for and select studies, decide what information to collect from each study, judge the risk of bias in studies, and assess the reliability of the results. We found 57 relevant studies, in which 2846 people (both males and females) took part. The studies' duration ranged from 5 weeks to 84 months. Our key results presented below are based on measurements taken between 4.4 weeks and 4 months. The studies evaluated hard stabilisation splints in comparison to no treatment, placebo (dummy splint), physical therapy, behavioural therapy, acupuncture, medication, or another type of occlusal splint. The studies involved people with different types of TMD receiving different types of treatments, and they measured the outcomes in different ways. This meant only a small number of participants contributed to each result, and so we have very little confidence in the available evidence.
It is unclear if the use of an occlusal splint has any effect on jaw-joint pain when chewing compared with a placebo splint or medicine in people with TMD because the type of TMD varied between studies.
Occlusal splints may reduce pain in jaw muscles when chewing compared to no treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if occlusal splint has any effect on pain in jaw muscles when chewing compared to laser treatment. It is unclear if occlusal splint has an effect on pain in jaw muscles at rest when compared with no treatment or physical therapy.
It is unclear if occlusal splint has an effect on the severity of jaw-joint clicking when compared with no treatment. Physical therapy may be better than occlusal splint for reducing joint noise severity, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if occlusal splint has an effect on the frequency of jaw-joint clicking when compared with placebo or jaw exercises.
It is unclear if one type of occlusal splint works better than another type of occlusal splint with a different mechanism of action.
None of the studies reported whether occlusal splints reduced discomfort or made TMD less likely to recur. We have very little confidence in the evidence because most studies had problems with the way they were designed. For example, some participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which may have affected how they felt about their symptoms or how they rated them. Not all studies provided results for all the outcomes we were interested in. This means that we should be cautious in interpreting the results because they may not be reliable. This review is based on a search carried out on 9 August 2022.
we reviewed all clinical trials in preterm babies for whom corticosteroids had been given systemically, that is, either as an injection or as a medicine, during the first week after birth, and for whom data on the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia later in the newborn period were available. We included 32 studies (4395 infants). The search is up-to-date as of 25 September 2020. this review of trials revealed that the benefits of giving systemic corticosteroids to infants starting within six days after birth may not outweigh the known adverse effects. However, a particular corticosteroid called hydrocortisone shows promise in improving short-term outcomes without adversely affecting long-term neurodevelopment, although the data on long-term outcomes are limited so far. Beneficial effects of systemic corticosteroids overall included shorter time on the ventilator and less bronchopulmonary dysplasia; adverse effects included higher blood pressure, bleeding from the stomach or bowel, perforation of the bowel, excessive glucose in the bloodstream, and increased risk of cerebral palsy at follow-up, particularly in those treated with dexamethasone - another type of corticosteroid. Early use of corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone, to treat or prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia should be curtailed until additional research has been performed. overall, the certainty of evidence supporting our conclusions is high.
We found 24 studies involving 1900 participants that met the review requirements and provided usable data. All studies compared group CBTp with standard care. Our evidence suggests there is no substantial difference between group CBTp and standard care or other psychosocial interventions in terms of numbers of participants leaving the study early. Group CBTp may be better than standard care or other psychosocial interventions for overall mental state for total symptoms of schizophrenia. Group CBTp seems to show no difference on positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to standard care or other psychosocial interventions. Group CBTp seems to be better than standard care or other psychosocial interventions on global functioning. There were no real differences between treatment groups for number of participants hospitalised for group CBTp compared to standard care or other psychosocial interventions. Group CBTp seems to be better than standard care or other psychosocial interventions on total symptoms of schizophrenia and global functioning. Studies with larger sample sizes and low risk of bias should be conducted. Longer-term outcomes need to be addressed to establish whether any effect is transient or long-lasting. Trials should improve their quality of data reporting.
We identified 16 trials involving 3578 adults that met our criteria. These studies included different types of interventions used in different places like touch screen computers in hospital clinics, computers connected to the Internet at home and programmes that communicated with mobile phones. The average age of people taking part was between 46 to 67 years old and most of those people had lived with diabetes for 6 to 13 years. Participants were given access to the interventions for 1 to 12 months, depending on the intervention. Three out of the 3578 participants died but these deaths did not appear to be linked to the trials.
Overall, there is evidence that computer programmes have a small beneficial effect on blood sugar control - the estimated improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - a long-term measurement of metabolic control) was 2.3 mmol/mol or 0.2%. This was slightly higher when we looked at studies that used mobile phones to deliver their intervention - the estimated improvement in HbA1c was 5.5 mmol/mol or 0.5% in the studies that used mobile phones. Some of the programmes lowered cholesterol slightly. None of the programmes helped with weight loss or coping with depression.
One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no obvious side effects and hypoglycaemic episodes were not reported in any of the studies. There was very little information about costs or value for money.
In summary, existing computer programmes to help adults self-manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small positive effect on blood sugar control and the mobile phone interventions appeared to have larger effects. There is no evidence to show that current programmes can help with weight loss, depression or improving health-related quality of life but they do appear to be safe.
The review identified 15 studies involving 4694 women. Delivery of the placenta by cord traction at caesarean section has more advantages compared to manual removal. These are less endometritis; less blood loss; less decrease in haematocrit levels postoperatively; and shorter duration of hospital stay.
When researchers want to answer a question they can use an approach called a systematic review, which is intended to examine all of the studies that have been done in a particular area of interest. When examining and summarizing the literature, researchers are expected to determine which of the studies were well-conducted (i.e. high quality) and those that were not. What we do not know enough about is how researchers should conduct the assessments to determine which studies were of high quality. This is important because if the researcher is aware of certain study characteristics (e.g. what journal the study was published in) they may inadvertently assess the study a certain way. For example, if the author of the study is well-known to the assessor, they may be more likely to assume it is of 'high quality'. Our research examines whether blinding researchers to study characteristics makes a difference when the goal is to summarize the literature. We only found a few studies that reported data relevant to our question. The results from these studies were inconsistent, however, the results suggest that it may not make a difference if quality is appraised under blinded or unblinded conditions during a systematic review.
We wanted to find out whether surgery or non-surgical treatment was better at preventing another knee cap dislocation and restoring knee function. We also looked at any unwanted effects of treatment, how satisfied people were with their treatment, symptoms of instability and the need for surgery after the initial treatment. We searched the medical literature until December 2021 for studies that compared surgical with non-surgical treatment for adults or children who had a patellar dislocation. We summarised and compared the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 10 relevant studies (519 adults and children). Studies randomly allocated people to receive surgery or a non-surgical treatment. In nine studies, people were treated for a first-time dislocation, one study treated people after repeated knee cap dislocations. People ranged from 13 to 27 years of age, with six studies including children. People in the studies were monitored from one to nine years after their injury. We were very uncertain about whether surgery compared to non-surgical treatment:
- reduced the number of repeat dislocations;
- affected how well the knee cap worked;
- increased or reduced the risk of side effects;
- made a difference to how satisfied people were with treatment;
- increased or reduced instability in the knee cap; or
- increased or reduced the need for additional surgery. These studies were small. Some had weaknesses in their design and conduct. The quality of the evidence is very low. We were very uncertain about these findings. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.
Although we found five studies which looked at anti-rejection drugs, they included people with a number of chronic conditions and not just cystic fibrosis. The studies we found reported results from all volunteers combined and we were not able to isolate the results that were specific to people with cystic fibrosis. We contacted the researchers who conducted these studies, but they have not sent us the specific results we need.
There is a review of drugs to suppress the immune systems of people who have had lung transplants (not restricted to those with cystic fibrosis) and this only included three studies which the review authors judged to have a high risk of bias. The review did not find that any one drug was better than another for reducing the chances of death or acute rejection; but one drug (tacrolimus) led to a lower risk of long-term rejection and high blood pressure, although there was a higher risk of diabetes.
Research is needed on the use of drugs that suppress the immune system in people with cystic fibrosis who have received a lung transplant. Due to the lack of research in this area, we do not plan to update this review again.
We found nine studies in 5437 men comparing dose-escalated RT with conventional dose RT. Most of the patients were in their late 60s to early 70s, and most of them had early-stage prostate cancer. Compared to conventional dose RT, dose-escalated RT probably has little to no effect on the risk of dying of prostate cancer. It also probably results in little to no effect on severe bowel or urinary-related unwanted effects in the long term. There is probably also little to no difference in the risk of dying from any cause or from developing spread to other organs (such as the bones or lymph nodes). Depending on the particular long-term quality of life measure, dose-escalated RT probably has or may have little to no effect on physical health and mental health, respectively. The certainty of the evidence for all main outcomes was moderate or low. The true effect may be quite different from what this review shows.
We searched scientific databases for randomised trials (clinical studies that randomly put people into different treatment groups) that systematically provided CVD risk scores or usual care to adults without a history of heart disease or stroke. The evidence is current to March 2016. Funding for the majority of trials came from government sources or pharmaceutical companies. We identified 41 trials that included 194,035 participants. Many of the studies had limitations. Low-quality evidence suggests that providing CVD risk scores had little or no effect on the number of people who develop heart disease or stroke. Providing CVD risk scores may reduce CVD risk factor levels (like cholesterol, blood pressure, and multivariable CVD risk) by a small amount and may increase cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-lowering medication prescribing in higher risk people. Providing CVD risk scores may reduce harms, but the results were imprecise. There is low-quality evidence to guide the use of CVD risk scores in clinical practice. Studies had multiple limitations and used different methods to provide CVD risk scores. It is likely that further research will influence these results.
We included three studies with 3384 participants. These studies were very different in terms of the participants (some with and some without stroke), the medications studied (single and combinations of different blood-thinners), and how the effects on memory and thinking were measured (different tests used for assessment). No trial consistently demonstrated an improvement in performance in memory and thinking tests or in daily activities. No trial assessed for a new diagnosis of dementia. There was suggestion of blood-thinning medications possibly causing an increased risk of bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding, but the numbers were too small to be certain that this was not just a chance difference. Overall, we considered that the quality of the evidence was poor for answering our review question regarding memory and thinking. Much of the information we needed was not reported. Two of the three studies were small, meaning that there was uncertainty around their results. In the only study that reported any benefit from blood-thinning medication, different measures of memory and thinking did not all agree with each other. Lastly, where there was an improvement in memory and thinking, the size of this improvement may have been too small to make a noticeable difference to the individual in reality. We found no convincing evidence that taking blood-thinning medications is beneficial for memory and thinking in people with cerebral small vessel disease. However, the studies were very different from each other, and each one had limitations with regard to our review question.
We wanted to find out if non-surgical treatments for arthritis of the big toe reduced peoples' pain and improved their function, quality of life and the structure of the big toe joint (based on X-rays). We also wanted to know if there were any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that investigated any non-surgical treatment compared with placebo (dummy or sham) treatment or another non-surgical treatment in people with arthritis of the big toe.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. Six studies with 547 participants aged between 32 and 62 years. Four studies took place in Australia, one in Turkey, and one in the USA. Each study looked at different treatments:
• arch-contouring foot inserts versus sham inserts; 
• shoe-stiffening inserts versus sham inserts; 
• hyaluronic acid (substance occurring naturally in the body that helps to lubricate and cushion the joints) injection versus saline (placebo) injection; 
• arch-contouring foot inserts versus rocker-sole footwear; 
• peloid therapy (application of clay mud at 42°C) versus paraffin therapy; 
• sesamoid mobilisation (moving the small bones in the foot), flexor hallucis longus (muscle connecting the calf muscle to the big toe) strengthening and gait training plus physical therapy versus physical therapy alone.  probably do not reduce pain, or improve function or quality of life. There may be a similar risk of unwanted effects. This study did not report X-ray results.
On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain, people with arch-contouring foot inserts reported a pain reduction of 0.4 points
• people with arch-contouring foot inserts rated their pain as 3.5 points;
• people with sham inserts rated their pain as 3.9 points.
On a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 is best function, people with arch-contouring foot inserts reported a worsening in function by 7.8 points
• people with arch-contouring foot inserts rated their function as 65.5 points.
• people with sham inserts rated their function as 73.3 points.
On a scale of -0.04 to 1.00, where 1.00 is best quality of life, people with arch-contouring foot inserts reported no difference in quality of life 
• people with arch-contouring foot inserts rated their quality of life as 0.81 points.
• people with sham inserts rated their quality of life as 0.81 points.
Unwanted effects (mostly foot pain) were reported by 6% fewer people with arch-contouring foot inserts
• 4/47 (9%) people with arch-contouring foot inserts reported an unwanted effect.
• 6/41 (15%) people with sham inserts reported an unwanted effect.
Withdrawals due to unwanted effects were reported by 2% more people with arch-contouring foot inserts
- 1/47 (2%) people with arch-contouring foot inserts withdrew due to unwanted effects.
- 0/41 (0%) people with sham inserts withdrew due to unwanted effects. probably do not reduce pain, improve function or quality of life. There was probably a similar risk of unwanted effects. probably do not reduce pain, or improve function, and may not improve the quality of life. There may be a lower risk of unwanted effects. For arthritis of the big toe, we are moderately confident that there are no benefits of arch-contouring foot inserts, shoe-stiffening inserts, or an injection of hyaluronic acid, but there are not enough studies to be certain. This updates our previous review, published in 2010. The evidence is up-to-date until 21 February 2023.
Overall, we considered the risk of bias for the majority of included studies to be low.
The review of trials found that none of these treatments provided a significant beneficial effect over placebo in improving the live birth rate or lowered the risk of future miscarriage in women who have recurrent miscarriages.
We wanted to find out the best interventions to reduce SSIs after heart surgery. We planned to assess the effectiveness of pre-, intra- and postoperative interventions to prevent SSIs after heart surgery (primary outcome) and also the impact these interventions have on complications, deaths and use of resources (secondary outcomes). We searched for studies (randomised controlled trials) that assessed an intervention to reduce or prevent SSI in adult patients (> 18 years of age) undergoing cardiac surgery (operations on the heart or great vessels). Following selection of appropriate studies, they were firstly categorised into pre-, intra- and postoperative interventions and then into appropriate comparisons based on what the intervention entailed.
A comparison of studies and our confidence in the evidence based on study methods and size were provided for each comparison. This review included 118 studies involving 51,854 participants. We identified 22 different interventional categories throughout the pre-, intra- and post-operative period that were implemented to reduce SSI in adult cardiac surgery. Given the size of this review and numerous differences in study methodology making certain comparisons less meaningful, we prioritised our discussion around four interventional categories. there is considerable uncertainty about the benefit of bacterial decolonisation (removing or reducing bacteria) and further work is required to investigate the impact this may have on bacterial resistance. tight blood sugar in people with diabetes may reduce SSIs; however, uncertainty remains in evidence in people without diabetes. Further research into patient-specific blood sugar control is needed. specialised dressings (negative pressure wound therapy) may reduce SSIs, but current studies are too small to be definitive. antibiotic sponges placed in the chest may reduce SSI of the sternum (breastbone), but it is unclear whether, if placed in the leg or arm, these will reduce SSIs there. The impact on bacterial resistance also remains unknown. The main limitation of the evidence is the inherent poor quality of the included studies. Only one study was perceived by authors to be at ‘low risk’ of bias. As a consequence of the inconsistency of SSI definitions, studies utilised and the manner in which interventions were implemented, meta-analyses (syntheses of evidence data) were not possible for many of the comparisons. Furthermore, many of the studies did not include sufficient numbers of participants to provide reliable conclusions. The evidence is up to date to May 2021.
We included 14 clinical trials (involving 1563 participants). They were conducted in Australia, Canada, Egypt, France, Italy, Iran and the UK. Most compared laparoscopic ablation or excision versus diagnostic laparoscopy. Only six of the 14 included trials reported their source of funding. The evidence was current to April 2020. We found that it is uncertain whether laparoscopic surgery improves overall pain compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only. Unfortunately, there were no data on live birth; however, we found that laparoscopic surgery may increase intrauterine (within the womb) pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only. We are uncertain whether laparoscopic excision is more effective than ablation in relieving pain, although this result came from a single study. There was insufficient evidence on side effects to allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding safety. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low with regard to the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery. Additional studies are needed in this field, and these should report certain specific endpoints for endometriosis (i.e. the core outcome set, developed by healthcare professionals, researchers and women with endometriosis) and adverse events as an outcome.
Participants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found seven randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 2702 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. One study investigating liraglutide dominated the evidence (2285/2702 participants). The participants in this study were overweight or obese.
This evidence is up to date as of January 2017. DPP-4 inhibitors did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with placebo (a dummy medicine). In the big study investigating the GLP-1-analogue liraglutide, given in a dose used for obese people (3.0 mg), the development of type 2 diabetes was delayed: 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo developed type 2 diabetes after 160 weeks. On the other side, 970/1472 (66%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 268/738 (36%) participants randomised to placebo switched back to normal glucose levels. This study was extended for another 12 weeks without treatment and five additional participants developed diabetes in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After the 12 weeks without treatment, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had glucose levels considered as normal. This means that to keep chances high to prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk one probably needs to continuously take this drug. Of note, serious adverse events (e.g. defined as hospitalisation or a hazard putting the participant at risk, such as an interaction with another medicine) happened more often following liraglutide treatment (230/1524 (15%) participants in the liraglutide group and 96/755 (13%) participants in the placebo group) and it is unclear whether taking this drug is safe in the long term.
We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 analogues in relation to non-fatal heart attacks, non-fatal strokes or heart failure. Our included studies did not report on other complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health-related quality of life were inconclusive. In the included studies, very few participants died and there was no apparent relation to treatment.
Future studies should investigate more patient-important outcomes like complications of diabetes and especially the side effects of the medications, because we do not know for sure whether 'prediabetes' is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement, is in fact a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient-important outcomes. All included trials had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how key items were reported. For the individual comparisons, the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).
In January 2017, we found eight clinical studies that examined 315 people. We included TENS administered to produce a non-painful 'tingling' sensation at the site of pain either as a treatment alone or combined with exercise treatment. All studies used TENS in comparison with 'fake' (called placebo or sham) TENS, no treatment, or other treatments such as medicine or hydrotherapy (treatment in water). We did not find enough high-quality studies to allow us to come to any conclusions about the effectiveness of TENS for fibromyalgia pain. Even though seven studies concluded that TENS relieved pain associated with fibromyalgia, the studies were low quality and the findings for measures of pain were inconsistently reported. Studies did not measure most of our outcomes and it was not always clear what aspects of pain were being reported (e.g. present pain, remembered pain, pain severity, etc.). Only one small pilot study found that one 30-minute treatment of TENS reduced pain on movement during and immediately after treatment; however, there were too few participants observed and it is unknown whether this effect would be maintained over a longer course of TENS treatments. Overall, it is not possible to judge whether TENS reduces pain associated with fibromyalgia. There were no serious side events reported in any of the studies. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. The quality of the evidence was very low overall because of a lack of data.
We found one small trial undertaken in 28 children aged 1 to 16 years with confirmed peanut allergy. The study did not include children who had moderate to severe asthma or who had had severe anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction that may result in death) because of their peanut allergy. The authors randomised children to intervention or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Intervention arm children received peanut flour whereas control arm participants received oat flour. The 48-week trial showed that treatment with peanut OIT enabled children receiving OIT to substantially increase the amount of peanut flour they ate in comparison with those in the placebo arm without having an allergic reaction.  However, almost half of the children (nine out of 19) receiving OIT had an allergic reaction due to the OIT which required antihistamines, and two had more serious reactions to the treatment which required adrenaline (epinephrine).
Although promising, based on the findings of this one small trial, we cannot recommend that peanut OIT be used routinely for people with peanut allergy. There is a need for further larger studies investigating safer OIT regimens and establishing the long-term effectiveness of OIT after treatment is stopped.
Four databases were searched up to November 2013. We found 15 trials that met our inclusion criteria. Four trials included individuals with headache pain, 10 trials included individuals with non-headache pain, and one trial included individuals with both headache and non-headache pain. We looked at data about pain, disability, depression, and anxiety immediately after the end of treatment and between 3 to 12 months follow-up. We also looked at how satisfied people were with the treatments, and its effects on their quality of life.
We found that for people with headache pain, pain symptoms and disability scores improved immediately following the end of treatment. However, only two trials could be entered into each of these analyses and so findings should be treated with caution. For people with non-headache pain, pain, disability, depression, and anxiety improved immediately after the end of treatment. Disability was also improved at follow-up. Only one study recorded quality of life scores in individuals with headache pain, so we were unable to analyse the results. Three studies presented quality of life scores for individuals with non-headache pain immediately following treatment. We did not find that quality of life improved after receiving the therapy. No data could be analysed on treatment satisfaction/acceptability.
We conclude that these findings are promising for psychological treatments delivered via the Internet for the management of chronic pain in adults, but more trials are needed to determine the efficacy of such therapies.
The review of trials found that clonidine can lead to a small increase in the number of people likely to quit smoking. However, the quality of the trials was poor, which makes the evidence less reliable. Adverse effects of clonidine included a dry mouth and sedation. Clonidine may not be the best option for people trying to quit smoking, but it might be useful for people who are not helped by nicotine replacement therapy or antidepressants.
The review includes 15 trials, covering 2387 women. Ten trials compared urinary-derived gonadotrophins with rFSH. Of these, three trials compared rFSH with human menopausal gonadotrophin, and seven trials compared rFSH with FSH-HP. Four trials compared FSH-P with human menopausal gonadotrophin. One trial compared gonadotrophins with continued clomiphene citrate. We found no trials that compared rFSH with FSH-P, or FSH-HP with FSH-P. The evidence is current to January 2018. There may be little or no difference in live birth, multiple pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, or miscarriage rate between urinary-derived gonadotrophins and recombinant FSH. We are uncertain whether human menopausal gonadotrophin or urinary follicle stimulating hormone improves pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS. We are uncertain whether the interventions decrease the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
When compared to continued treatment with clomiphene citrate, gonadotrophins resulted in more live births without increasing the rate of multiple pregnancies. Gonadotrophins resulted in more clinical pregnancies, but also in more miscarriages than clomiphene citrate, while there were no cases of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The quality of the evidence was low to very low for outcomes from rFSH versus urinary gonadotrophins, and human menopausal gonadotrophin versus FSH-P. The quality of the evidence was moderate for outcomes from gonadotrophins versus continued clomiphene citrate.
Ten of the fifteen studies included in this review reported a commercial sponsor.
The evidence was current to December 2013. We found four randomized clinical trials involving 210 participants aged from one day to 17 years with PH either in the preoperative (one study) or postoperative period (three studies). Control groups received conventional management therapy (two trials) or nitrogen gas as placebo (two trials). Two trials compared changes in systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressure and heart rate (haemodynamics). The other two trials compared the number of pulmonary hypertensive crises and deaths, with changes in haemodynamic measurements as secondary outcomes. We found no differences between the groups of patients who received iNO and those that did not. Two trials reported on deaths before discharge, with none occurring in one of the trials. We observed no differences in the number of deaths (two trials); pulmonary hypertensive crises (one trial); changes in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (three trials), arterial pressure (three trials), or heart rate (HR) (three trials); or changes in oxygenation of the blood (one trial). However, no trials reported long-term deaths or neurodevelopmental disability. In addition, no data were available for analysis of length of hospital stay.
Although iNO has been studied as a postsurgical therapy in children with heart disease in order to assist recovery, this review showed no benefits with its use. Two trials had a low risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was, however, very low due to the small number of participants and low event rates. All trials utilized different concentrations of iNO, different durations of administration initiated at different times after the operation, and included patients with diverse congenital heart defects necessitating repair.
We searched the literature in order to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared stereotactic radiotherapy to other treatment methods. None of the studies we identified met the criteria for inclusion in this review.
There is currently no high quality evidence from RCTs to determine whether any of the treatment options for patients with a vestibular schwannoma have clear advantages over the others. Treatment therefore has to be selected on an individual basis, taking into account the patient's own preferences, clinician experience and the availability of radiotherapeutic equipment. Further research is needed to compare the efficacy and safety of all the different treatment options.
We wanted to know whether any assistive technology was better than routine therapy, no therapy, or another assistive technology for improving passive range of motion (how much a person can move a joint with outside assistance) and hygiene in adults after a stroke. We also wanted to know if assistive technology had any unwanted effects. We looked for studies that evaluated the effects of assistive technology compared with no treatment, routine therapy, or another assistive technology. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found seven small studies that compared assistive technology with routine therapy. The types of assistive technology were electrical stimulation, splinting, positioning wrists using a hinged board, and a non-robotic device with electrical stimulation. The treatments lasted between four and 12 weeks. Some studies included people with conditions other than stroke as well as people with stroke. Where possible, we only analysed the results of the people with stroke. We were only able to analyse data from five studies involving 252 people. Immediate effects of treatment were measured after the last stretch intervention in the study period.
We are very uncertain whether assistive technology is better than routine therapy for improving passive range of motion in the wrist, shoulder, or elbow. No studies reported any measures of hygiene. Unwanted effects were pain during application of stretch to muscles and skin breakdown when using a thumb splint. We are not confident in the evidence because it comes from only seven small studies, and the people giving and receiving treatment knew which treatment group they were in (assistive technology or routine therapy). In addition, different studies used different methods of applying stretch and different scales to measure the results. The evidence is current to May 2022.
We searched the electronic databases and found 16 randomised trials (18 publications) that met our selection criteria. These trials involved delivery of surfactant via a thin catheter. Evidence is up-to-date as of 30 September 2020. Surfactant delivery via a thin catheter to spontaneously breathing preterm infants compared with surfactant administration through an ETT was associated with a decrease in the following: risk of death or BPD, need for assisted breathing in the first 72 hours of life, severe brain bleeding, death during first hospitalisation, and BPD among survivors. We are uncertain as to whether the intervention has an important effect on air leak requiring drainage because the results are imprecise. None of the studies reported on the outcome of death or survival with disability. The procedure had rates of adverse effects similar to surfactant administration through an ETT. These data suggest that treatment with surfactant via a thin catheter is preferable to surfactant therapy through an ETT. Further well-designed studies of adequate size and power, as well as ongoing studies, are required to confirm and refine these findings, and to clarify whether surfactant therapy via a thin catheter provides benefits over continuation of non-invasive respiratory support without surfactant. Most of the studies had important methodological weaknesses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. We downgraded the evidence to 'moderate to low'. More good quality studies are urgently needed to address uncertainties within important subgroups.
To find out whether antibiotics work for the common cold we identified studies that compared one group of people taking an antibiotic with another group of people taking a medication that looked similar but contained no antibiotic (a placebo). We found six studies of the common cold, with 1047 participants and five studies of acute purulent rhinitis, with 791 participants. Many of the studies had flaws which might have biased the results, especially because many of the participants probably had chest or sinus infections that the researchers did not know about.
Results suggest that antibiotics do not work for either the common cold or for acute purulent rhinitis and many people are affected by antibiotic side effects.
We found the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low. The trial itself was only published as an abstract from a conference which did not include numerical data and it was not published as a full report. This meant that we do not know many details about the trial. We thought that the overall risk of bias was unclear, as the trial authors did not describe how participants were put into the treatment groups, whether any participants dropped out or whether the planned outcomes were the same as the reported outcomes. The trial also had a very small number of participants and a limited age range, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relevance of the treatment for all people with cystic fibrosis.
We searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature, compared their results, and summarized the evidence. We assessed how certain the evidence was for each finding, based on factors such as how well studies were conducted, study sizes, or consistency of findings across studies. We categorized the evidence as being of very low-, low-, moderate-, or high-certainty. We identified 10 studies on 4348 people with diabetic macular edema. Participants were followed for nine to 36 months. The studies investigated three different injected steroids: dexamethasone, fluocinolone, and triamcinolone. Six studies were funded by pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Benefits (measured 12 or 24 months after treatment)
Compared to a sham treatment:
• Dexamethasone and fluocinolone probably improve visual sharpness and reduce thickness of the retina more; triamcinolone may also do this.
• It is probable that more people’s vision improves by three lines or more on a vision chart with fluocinolone. Evidence is insufficient to tell whether dexamethasone or triamcinolone has the same effect.
Compared to antiangiogenics (medicines that prevent new blood vessels forming behind the retina):
• Dexamethasone probably improves visual sharpness similarly or slightly less but may reduce thickness of the retina slightly more. Triamcinolone may improve visual sharpness less too; we do not know how it affects thickness of the retina because the evidence is of very low-certainty.
• We cannot tell whether more people’s vision improves by three lines or more on a vision chart with dexamethasone or triamcinolone. This is because the evidence on dexamethasone is inconsistent and of low-certainty, and no studies on triamcinolone evaluated this.
Compared to laser therapy:
• Triamcinolone may make little or no difference to whether people’s vision improves by three lines or more on a vision chart.
• We do not know whether triamcinolone increases visual sharpness or reduces thickness of the retina more due to insufficient evidence.
Risks (measured nine to 36 months after treatment)
Compared to a sham treatment:
• It is probable that cataracts progress in more people with dexamethasone or fluocinolone; cataract may be more likely with triamcinolone too.
• It is probable that more people treated with dexamethasone or fluocinolone need drops that lower eye pressure. The evidence is too imprecise to show if triamcinolone affects the need for such drops.
• Fluocinolone may increase the risk of needing surgery for glaucoma (optic nerve damage caused by high pressure in the eye). There is insufficient evidence to show if dexamethasone or triamcinolone affects the need for glaucoma surgery.
Compared to antiangiogenics:
• Cataract progression and the need for pressure-lowering eye drops is probably greater with dexamethasone.
•We do not know if dexamethasone affects the need for glaucoma surgery because the evidence is poor and imprecise.
•There is insufficient evidence to show if triamcinolone causes more adverse effects.
Compared to laser therapy:
• Cataract progression and the need for pressure-lowering eye drops is probably greater with triamcinolone.
• The evidence is too imprecise to show how triamcinolone affects the need for glaucoma surgery. Evidence of low- to moderate-certainty suggests that:
- steroids may be, or probably are, more effective than a sham treatment;
- steroids may be, or probably are, less effective at improving visual sharpness than antiangiogenics;
- steroids may, or probably, increase the risk of cataract progression and elevated eye pressure. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 15 May 2019.
The findings are based on eight studies measuring a variety of outcomes, using a range of standardised measures. It was possible to combine results (meta-analysis) for nine comparisons. Results from four of these meta-analyses suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving parent responsiveness to the child, and parent-child interaction, both post-intervention and at follow-up. Infant responsiveness to the mother also showed improvement at follow-up. The results of the other five meta-analyses we carried out were inconclusive.
Further rigorous research is needed that provides both short- and long-term follow-up of the children of teenage parents, and that assesses the benefits of parenting programmes for young fathers as well as young mothers.
This review found that intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin is more efficacious than epirubicin to prevent cancer recurrence. However, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin appears to induce greater local and systemic adverse effects than epirubicin.
The evidence is current to November 2014. We included trials with interventions lasting at least three months. We found 11 completed trials (1369 participants). These trials showed variation in participants recruited, duration of qigong and follow-up of the interventions. For two trials that were followed up for many years after trial completion, results showed that qigong had a beneficial effect on all-cause mortality, stroke mortality and stroke incidence, but it is not clear whether this effect can be attributed to qigong, as it is uncertain whether qigong was practised during the years after the trials ended. Some beneficial effects of qigong on blood pressure and blood lipid levels were observed, but these results were based on only a small number of studies with small sample size that were at significant risk of bias. Therefore, additional large, high-quality, long-term trials are needed before we will be able to determine whether qigong is beneficial for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
The review identified only two randomised controlled trials, involving 262 patients with breast cancer. The data from these studies provide low-grade evidence for multidisciplinary rehabilitation in producing short-term gains at the levels of impairment (range of shoulder movement), psychosocial adjustment and quality of life after breast cancer treatment. None of the studies reported the longer-term functional outcomes of such care, the impact on caregivers or cost effectiveness of these programmes.
Overall, the results of this review suggest that multidisciplinary rehabilitation is not harmful and may improve functional ability and quality of life in the short term. This review highlights the lack of robust trials in the field and the need for further high-quality trial-based research.
What are the benefits and risks of massage for treating acute, subacute and chronic persisting neck pain in adults with or without arm pain and headache or associated with a whiplash injury? Does the dose (frequency per week, total number of weeks, session duration) of massage influence findings? We found 33 studies that involved 1994 people suffering subacute and persisting moderate to very strong neck pain including arm pain (6%), whiplash (3%) or headache stemming from the neck (9%). There were no studies addressing acute pain. Studies examined adults aged 18 to 70 years, who were mostly female (70%). Trials were conducted in outpatient settings in Asia, America, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Funding, when reported (in 15% of studies), was from research centres or universities. We included studies evaluating many massage techniques (with ischaemic compression, a sustained pressure over the soft tissue, being the most common technique) that vary in the manner in which touch is applied, the amount of pressure and intensity that is applied, and session frequency. We did not include techniques that used a massage tool to deliver treatment or non-touch energy techniques.
Compared with a 'dummy' massage treatment, massage probably results in little to no difference in the following:
• Pain (3% improvement): People who had a 'dummy' massage rated their pain at 20.55 points while people who had massage rated their post-treatment pain as 17.12 points. Those who used massage improved by 3.43 points (8.16 better to 1.29 worse) on a 0- to 100-point scale, where a lower score means less pain.
• Function-disability (10% improvement): People who had a 'dummy' massage rated their function-disability at 30.9 points. People who had massage rated their post-treatment function-disability as 21.21 points. Those who used massage improved by 9.69 points (17.57 better to 1.81 better) on a 0- to 100-point scale, where a lower score means better function-disability.
• Participant-reported treatment success (11% improvement): People who had a 'dummy' massage rated their self-reported treatment success at 3.1 points. People who had massage treatment rated their post-treatment success as 2.3 points. Those who used massage improved by 0.80 points (1.39 better to 0.21 better) on a 1- to 7-point scale, where a lower score means more self-reported treatment success.
• Health-related quality of life (5% improvement): People who had a 'dummy' massage rated their quality of life at 43.2 points. People who had massage rated their post-treatment quality of life as 48.5 points. Those who used massage improved by 5.30 points (8.24 better to 2.36 better) on a 0- to 100-point scale, where a higher score means better quality of life.
• Patient satisfaction and serious adverse events - these outcomes were not reported.
• Minor adverse events - minor adverse (unwanted or harmful) events were poorly reported, were the same as with the dummy massage and included minor temporary effects such as mild treatment soreness. We have little confidence in our findings that massage provides little to no benefit in terms of pain, function-disability, quality of life and participant-reported treatment success compared to a 'dummy' massage, because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. We believe that these biases may result in either an over or underestimation of the size of the effect reported. The occurrence of adverse events was not commonly reported. The number of participants in most trials was small. Focused planning of studies with larger numbers of participants, adequate massage doses and control for study biases is needed. We searched databases up to 1 October 2023.
The researchers identified four studies that included a total of 206 participants. All of the studies were small in size and were judged to be of unclear quality. The studies compared anti-tuberculous therapy (i.e. clofazimine or combination therapy with clofazimine, rifampin, ethambutol, and dapsone or combination therapy with clarithromycin, rifabutin and clofazimine) to placebo (inactive pills or tablets). Anti-tuberculous therapy may provide a benefit over placebo for the prevention of relapse in participants with Crohn's disease in remission. However, this result is very uncertain due to unclear study quality and the small numbers of patients assessed. Participants receiving anti-tuberculous drugs had more side effects than placebo participants. Common side effects included reversible pink skin discolouration and rash. No serious side effects were reported in the four studies. Further studies are needed to provide better quality evidence for the use of anti-tuberculous therapy for maintaining remission in people with inactive Crohn's disease.
The evidence on which this review is based was correct as of 28 October 2013. This is an update to an existing review, which included one study. Fifteen studies were included in this review involving data from 561 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. Most took place in university settings or training hospitals and one in a specialist orthodontic practice. Most studies contained a similar number of males and females, however there were more females than males in five studies and only females in two. The age range varied from adolescents and young adults to adults up to the age of 54 years. All participants in the studies needed a course of orthodontic treatment with additional anchorage control. None of the studies reported adverse effects. When surgically implanted anchorage devices were compared to conventional anchorage devices, they were better in providing stabilisation for preventing unwanted movement in teeth during orthodontic treatment. There was limited information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and how acceptable the devices were found to be. No information was reported on adverse events. The quality of the evidence for the important outcomes in this review ranged from moderate to low quality. The main shortcomings of all of the studies were related to issues with their design and the way they were carried out, with insufficient and low quality reporting of the study methods and outcomes.
We searched the literature for randomised controlled trials up to 23 September 2013, and included 71 trials. The included studies compared chlorpromazine with three newer antipsychotics: risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine. Most included trials were short term studies and undertaken in China. Based on low quality evidence, we found that chlorpromazine is not much different to risperidone or quetiapine but is associated with more side effects. More favourable results were found for olanzapine with those receiving olanzapine experiencing fewer side effects and greater improvements in global state and quality of life than those receiving chlorpromazine, but again this is based on low quality evidence. Larger, longer, better conducted and reported trials should focus on important outcomes such as quality of life, levels of satisfaction with treatment or care, relapse, costs and hospital discharge or admission. Also, more international studies are needed. Outpatient treatment was under-represented in the included studies, and future research should also include work with this group of people.
Due to the limitations of evidence in this Cochrane review, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. Chlorpormazine is available widely, is comparable with the newer antipsychotics and is relatively cheap so despite its propensity to cause side effects, is likely to remain one of the benchmark antipsychotics.
The plain language summary has been written by a consumer. Ben Gray: Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation. http://mcpin.org/.
This updated review now includes 14 trials. We were able to use data from 10 of the trials, involving a total of 1055 women. We found no trials on reflexology, osteopathy, shiatsu and zero balancing therapy.
In the various included trials, massage was given either by the woman's birth companion, a student midwife, a physiotherapist or a massage therapist (though some trials did not report who gave the massage). Three trials involved a two- to three-hour prebirth course attended by women and their partners, and delivered by a qualified practitioner. In three trials, the intervention was delivered by a qualified health practitioner (massage therapist, physiotherapist or nurse/researcher with unspecified qualifications). In one trial, nurses taught women's partners in the labour ward. There was insufficient reporting of the qualifications of the practitioner teaching massage.
We found that massage and thermal packs, in comparison to usual care or music, may help women manage labour pain intensity during the first stage when the cervix is dilating. However, the quality of this evidence was very low. The effects of massage on assisted vaginal birth, caesarean section rate, the length of labour and use of drugs for pain relief were less clear, and the quality of the evidence was also very low. Two small trials showed increased satisfaction with childbirth, and a greater sense of control for women receiving massage.
Warm packs were associated with reduced pain in the first stage of labour and reduced length of labour (very low-quality evidence). Massage may help women cope with pain in labour and may give them a better birth experience, and warm packs and thermal methods may help with pain. However, the quality of the evidence was generally low or very low, partly due to the trials being small and without sufficient numbers of women participating. These findings highlight a need for further research on this topic.
Despite a comprehensive search, we identified only three small randomised controlled trials with a total of 109 participants. Each trial tested different interventions for treating a complete intra-articular fracture in which the joint surface is separated from the shaft of the humerus. One trial compared open reduction and internal fixation versus total elbow replacement in people aged 65 years and older. This found some limited evidence that internal fixation is sometimes not practical for some more complex and difficult fractures and that people treated total elbow replacement may have a better outcome early on (around six months). The second trial compared two ways of placing two plates used for internal fixation. These were either perpendicular (where the plates were at right angles to each other along the bone) or parallel (where the plates were on either side of the bone). The trial did not find any major differences in outcome between the two methods. The third trial did not provide clear evidence of a difference in two surgical approaches of managing pre-operative ulnar nerve dysfunction.
In all, none of these three under-sized trials provided adequate evidence to determine which of the surgical interventions under test was the most appropriate. The review found no evidence to inform on the use of more current methods of surgical fixation, specifically the use of locking plates.
This review of four studies with 166 relevant participants, looked at whether participating in home-based therapy programmes, targeted at the upper limb, could improve performance in activities of daily living (ADL), functional movement of the upper limb, performance in extended ADL and arm motor impairment. In comparison with usual care, home-based upper limb programmes had no difference in effect on any of the outcomes. In comparison with an upper limb programme based in hospital, we found home-based upper limb programmes to be no more or no less effective for arm motor impairment outcomes. The evidence in this area is limited. Further research is needed to determine the effects of home-based therapy programmes.
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trial's Register in January 2015 and March 2016 and found four relevant studies involving 300 adults diagnosed with both SMI and PTSD. The participants received treatments that included trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), and brief psychoeducation. All of these therapies support individuals to work through and process the memories, emotions and behaviours associated with trauma.
Key results
When TF-CBT was compared to the care usually received, no effect for reducing PTSD, psychotic, depressive or anxiety symptoms or improving quality of life, was noted. There was some low-quality evidence from two studies that people with SMI and PTSD receiving TF-CBT were more likely to recover from PTSD, that is, having PTSD symptoms which are below diagnostic threshold. TF-CBT was not linked to an increase in side effects.
A comparison of people receiving EMDR against those awaiting treatment showed a favourable effect for reducing the symptoms of PTSD (very low-quality evidence). Again, there was no difference in side effects. No data were available for the effect of EMDR on quality of life, psychosis, depression or anxiety.
A comparison of TF-CBT with EMDR indicated no difference in reduction of PTSD symptom severity (very low-quality evidence).
Finally, when TF-CBT was compared with brief psychoeducation there was no evidence that either therapy was superior in treating a range of PTSD symptoms.
Quality of the evidence
The review identifies limited, low-quality evidence on TF-CBT and EMDR. The effects of these treatments in reducing the symptoms of PTSD remain unclear although they do not appear to cause any more side effects than waiting for treatment. However, many important outcomes of interest have not been reported on and more research into the benefits of trauma-focused psychological interventions for individuals with SMI and PTSD is required.
We wanted to find out:
- if child protection training improves professionals' reporting of child abuse and neglect;
- what components of effective training help professionals to report child abuse and neglect; and
- if the training causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared:
- child protection training with no training or with a waitlist control (those placed on a waiting list to receive the training at a later date); and
- child protection training with alternative training (not related to child abuse and neglect, e.g. cultural sensitivity training).
We compared and summarised study results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and size. We found 11 studies that involved 1484 people. The studies ranged in size from 30 to 765 participants. Nine studies were conducted in the USA, one in Canada, and one in the Netherlands. A number of different types of training interventions were tested in the studies. Some were face-to-face workshops, ranging in duration from a single two-hour workshop to six 90-minute seminars conducted over one month; and some were self-paced e-learning interventions. The training was developed by experts and delivered by specialist facilitators, content area experts, or interdisciplinary teams. Nine studies received external funding: five from federal government agencies, two from a university and philanthropic organisation, one from the philanthropic arm of an international technology company, and one from a non-government organisation (a training intervention developer). It is unclear if child protection training has an effect on:
- the number of reported cases of child abuse and neglect (one study, 42 participants); or
- the number of reported cases based on hypothetical cases of child abuse and neglect (two studies, 87 participants).
Based on the available information, we were unable answer our question about whether training has an effect on the number of official cases recorded by child protection authorities, or the quality of those reports; or whether training has any unwanted effects.
Child protection training may increase professionals' knowledge of reporting duty, processes, and procedures (one study, 744 participants). However, it is unclear if this training has an effect on:
- professionals’ knowledge of core concepts in child abuse and neglect generally (two studies, 154 participants);
- professionals’ knowledge of core concepts in child sexual abuse specifically (three studies, 238 participants);
- professionals’ skill in distinguishing between reportable and non-reportable cases (one study, 25 participants); or
- professionals’ attitudes towards the duty to report (one study, 741 participants). We have low to very low confidence in the evidence. This is because the results were based on a small number of studies, some of which were old and which had methodological problems. For example, the people involved in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data for all our outcomes of interest. In addition, our analyses sometimes only included one professional group, limiting the applicability of our findings to other professional groups. The evidence is current to 4 June 2021.
We found 48 randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing treatment versus no treatment or versus a different treatment method in a total of 5384 men. The evidence is current to April 2020. We are uncertain whether surgical or radiological treatment improves live birth rates when compared to no treatment. Treatment may improve pregnancy rates compared to delayed or no treatment. The evidence suggests that couples with no or delayed treatment have a 21% chance of pregnancy, whilst the pregnancy rate after surgical or radiological treatment is between 22% and 48%. Data were lacking on adverse events, varicocele recurrence, and quality of life.
We are uncertain about the effect of surgical versus radiological treatment on live birth, pregnancy rate, varicocele recurrence, and the adverse event hydrocele formation. Data were lacking on quality of life for this comparison.
Microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment probably improves pregnancy rates slightly compared to other surgical treatments. This suggests that couples with microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment have a 10% to 14% chance of pregnancy after treatment, whilst the pregnancy rate in couples after other surgical treatments is 10%. This procedure also probably reduces the risk of varicocele recurrence. This suggests that 0.4% to 1.1% of men undergoing microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment experience recurrent varicocele, whilst 1.4% of men undergoing other surgical treatments do. Results on adverse events were inconclusive. Data were lacking on live birth and quality of life.
We are uncertain about the effects of open inguinal surgical treatment versus retroperitoneal surgical treatment on adverse events, pregnancy rates, or varicocele recurrence. Data were lacking on live birth and quality of life.
We are uncertain about the effects of radiological treatment (sclerotherapy versus embolisation) on varicocele recurrence. Data were lacking on live birth, adverse events, pregnancy, and quality of life. Our findings were inconclusive, as the certainty of the available evidence ranged from moderate to very low depending on outcome. More research is needed with live birth or pregnancy rate as the primary outcome.
This review examines the effectiveness of speech and language therapy interventions for children with primary speech and language delay/disorder. The review concludes that whilst there may be some support for the effectiveness of speech and language therapy for children with expressive phonological and expressive vocabulary difficulties, the evidence concerning the effectiveness of interventions for expressive syntax is mixed, and no evidence is available concerning interventions for children with receptive language difficulties.
Treating all HIV-positive adults with deworming drugs without knowledge of their helminth infection status may have a small suppressive effect on viral load at six weeks (low quality evidence ), but repeated dosing over two years appears to have little or no effect on either viral load (moderate quality evidence ) or CD4+ cell count (low quality evidence). These findings are based on two included studies.
Providing deworming drugs to HIV-positive adults with diagnosed helminth infection may result in a small suppressive effect on mean viral load at six to 12 weeks (low quality evidence ) and a small favourable effect on mean CD4+ cell count at 12 weeks (low quality evidence). However, these findings are based on small studies and are strongly influenced by a single study of praziquantel for schistosomiasis. Further studies from different settings and populations are needed for confirmation.
Adverse events were not well reported (very low quality evidence), and trials were too small to evaluate the effects on mortality (low quality evidence ). However there is no suggestion that deworming drugs are harmful for HIV-positive individuals.
Seven randomised controlled trials involving 1839 patients with clinically confirmed DVT compared home (LMWH) versus hospital (unfractionated heparin, or LMWH in one trial) treatment. Trials had limitations, including high exclusion rates and designs that did not take into account short hospital stays for any of the people treated at home to allow fair comparison of heparin in hospital with LMWH at home.
Trials showed that patients treated at home with LMWH had less recurrence of VTE than hospital-treated patients. The review showed no clear differences between treatment groups for major bleeding, minor bleeding, or death. No study reported venous gangrene. We could not pool information on patient satisfaction and quality of life, as studies had different ways of reporting these, but two of the three studies reporting on quality of life provided evidence that home treatment led to greater improvement in quality of life compared with in-patient treatment, at some point during follow-up. The third study reported that a large number of participants chose to switch from in-patient care to home-based care for social and personal reasons, indicating that home treatment was better accepted than in-patient treatment. Studies that looked at cost found that cost of home management was lower per incident of treatment. Overall, the quality of evidence of the available data was low to very low owing to risk of bias, indirectness, and differences in measuring and reporting of outcomes. Risk of bias is a concern, as many of the included studies did not fully explain how they randomised and allocated participants to treatments, and blinding techniques described were not clear. Full blinding would be difficult if not impossible for these types of treatments (home vs hospital), but some techniques could be put in place such as using the same treatment medications or blinding those who measure outcomes. Another concern of reviewers was that in some studies, participants randomised to home treatment actually ended up being treated in hospital but remained in their assigned treatment for the analysis (this is known as indirectness). This makes it hard to determine whether trial results actually can be used to answer the question of whether home versus hospital treatment for DVT is superior. A further concern regarding a few of outcomes is variation in the way outcomes were measured and reported.
We identified 68 randomised controlled trials comparing various treatments for impetigo. Altogether, these studies evaluated 26 oral treatments and 24 topical treatments, including placebo, and results were described for 5708 participants.
Overall, topical antibiotics showed better cure rates than topical placebo.
Two antibiotic creams, mupirocin and fusidic acid, are at least as effective as oral antibiotics where the disease is not extensive. There was no clear evidence that either of these most commonly studied topical antibiotics was more effective than the other.
Topical mupirocin was superior to the oral antibiotic, oral erythromycin.
We found that the oral antibiotic, oral penicillin, is not effective for impetigo, while other oral antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin and cloxacillin) can help.
It is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics for people with extensive impetigo.
There is a lack of evidence to suggest that using disinfectant solutions improves impetigo. When 2 studies with 292 participants were pooled, topical antibiotics were significantly better than disinfecting treatments.
Reported side-effects for topical treatments were mild and low in frequency; the treatments sometimes resulted in itching, burning, or staining. Oral antibiotics produced gastrointestinal complaints, such as nausea and diarrhoea, in 2% to 30% of participants, depending upon the specific antibiotic.
Worldwide, bacteria causing impetigo show growing resistance rates for commonly used antibiotics. For a newly developed topical treatment, retapamulin, no resistance has yet been reported.
We found five controlled before-after (CBA) studies from South Africa, India, Uganda, and Kenya and one randomized controlled trial from the USA. The studies included over 48,000 participants. Five studies examined antiretroviral therapy and one study examined vocational interventions as a way of improving return to work in HIV+ people. The five CBA studies found that antiretroviral therapy interventions may increase employment outcomes in HIV+ people. One study assessed the effect of making changes to work tasks or the work environment but did not report enough data to say if it helped or not. We found no studies on psychological support to help HIV+ people cope better. Overall, we found very low-quality evidence because the included studies all had a high risk of bias. We found very low-quality evidence that antiretroviral therapy interventions could improve employment outcomes for HIV+ people. We need high-quality, randomized trials to find out if pharmacological, vocational, and psychological interventions can improve employment outcomes for HIV+ people.
We found one study comparing zonisamide versus placebo, involving a total of 20 randomised participants with essential tremor. The impact of zonisamide on functional abilities, risk of treatment discontinuation, and adverse events is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low. Adverse events were only reported in participants from the zonisamide group, making it possible that they were aware of which treatment they had been receiving. Quality of life was not assessed in the study included. The single study we found was small and the possibility of study participants becoming aware of the treatment group means that we cannot be certain about the risk-benefit profile of this treatment.
The review of four small trials found that there was no large difference between the drugs in the short term. There is not enough evidence to exclude a small difference in benefit, long term effects or a difference in less common adverse effects. More research is needed into the long term and adverse effects of these drugs.
We identified seven trials for inclusion including 614 people. Four trials compared selective bowel decontamination (prolonged use of antibiotics to clear bacteria in the gut) versus placebo (inactive intervention) or no treatment. In one trial, people were randomised to selective bowel decontamination, active lactobacillus with fibres (probiotic with prebiotic), or to inactivated lactobacillus with fibres (prebiotic). In one trial, probiotic with prebiotic was compared with prebiotic. In another trial, different doses of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; substance that stimulates the immune response) and placebo were compared. Most trials included adults undergoing elective liver transplantation. There were five comparisons: selective bowel decontamination versus inactive control; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics with probiotics; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics; prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics; and G-CSF versus control. There was no trial comparing different antibiotics to prevent bacterial infective complications and wound complications in people undergoing liver transplantation. There was no significant difference in proportion of people who died or required retransplantation between the intervention and control groups in any of the five comparisons. There was no significant difference in the graft rejections, intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the intervention and control groups in any of the comparisons. Overall, 193/611 (31.6%) participants developed infective complications. The proportion of people who developed infective complications and the number of infective complication episodes were significantly higher in the selective bowel decontamination group than prebiotics with probiotics group. There was no significant difference between the proportion of people who developed infection and the number of infective complication episodes between groups in any of the other comparisons. Quality of life and serious adverse events in the groups were not reported in any of the trials. There is no clear evidence that any of the interventions may be of benefit. Selective bowel decontamination may even increase the risk of infection compared to prebiotics with probiotics. Most of the trials were at high risk of systematic errors (there was a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (there was a potential to arrive at the wrong conclusions because of the play of chance). The overall quality of evidence is very low. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary in people undergoing liver transplantation. Such trials should include patient-oriented outcomes such as mortality, graft failure, quality of life, length of hospital stay, and serious adverse events related to the treatment.
This review found there was not enough evidence to say if one method of manipulation is better than another, or that manipulation is needed.
There was no statistically significant difference in the number of people who died during treatment with formoterol compared with placebo or salbutamol. Because so few people die of asthma, huge trials or observational studies are normally required to detect a difference in death rates from asthma. There were more non-fatal serious adverse events in people taking formoterol compared to those on placebo; for every 149 people treated with formoterol for 16 weeks, one extra non-fatal event occurred in comparison with placebo. There was no significant difference in serious adverse events in people on formoterol compared to regular salbutamol.
We conclude that regular formoterol should not be taken by people who are not taking regular inhaled steroids due to the increased risk of serious adverse events. Formoterol should not be used as a substitute for inhaled corticosteroids, and adherence with inhaled steroids should be kept under review if separate inhalers are used when formoterol is added to inhaled corticosteroids.
A search for trials was carried out in July 2012. The review now includes seven studies with a total of 479 participants and assesses the effects of perazine for people with schizophrenia. Comparisons of perazine versus placebo (‘dummy’ treatment) and versus other antipsychotic drugs revealed no clear differences or superiority of perazine. However, only a handful of studies have been undertaken and the number of participants in each study was small. In addition the studies avialable were of limited quality with data for the main outcomes of interest rated as low or very low quality. As perazine is a cheap drug and there is some limited evidence that it may cause less side effects than other older antipsychotic drugs, further large scale, well designed and well-reported studies are much needed.

The evidence is current to July 2015. In this update, we identified seven randomised controlled trials that compared only giving platelet transfusions to treat bleeding versus giving platelet transfusions to prevent and treat bleeding. One trial is still recruiting participants and has not been completed. We reviewed six randomised controlled trials with a total of 1195 participants. These trials were conducted between 1978 and 2013. Five of the trials included adults who were receiving chemotherapy or a stem cell transplantation as treatment for blood cancers. One of the trials included children receiving chemotherapy for leukaemia.
Four of the six studies reported funding sources; these were charitable foundations or government funds. Giving platelet transfusions to prevent and treat bleeding in patients with low platelet counts due to blood cancers or their treatments may result in a reduction in bleeding when compared with giving platelet transfusions only to treat bleeding.
There may not be an increased risk of death or adverse events if platelet transfusions are only given to treat bleeding versus giving platelet transfusions to prevent and treat bleeding, but there was not enough evidence to be certain about this.
Giving platelet transfusions only when bleeding occurs probably reduces the number of platelets given.
None of the six studies reported any quality-of-life outcomes. The evidence for most of the findings was of low or moderate quality, as patients and their doctors knew which study arm the patient had been put in; outcomes reported in the studies were difficult to compare because bleeding was measured and reported differently; and some outcomes were imprecise, because the outcome did not happen very often (such as death).
We searched the medical literature for randomised double-blind controlled clinical trials with or without placebo (dummy treatment) to November 2019. Randomised controlled trials are studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method. In a double-blind study, neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving a particular treatment. We found two trials that looked at treatment of chronic Typanosoma cruzi infection (late-stage, symptomatic Chagas disease and CCC) with the trypanocidal drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox. After reviewing this limited evidence, we concluded that it is insufficient to support treatment with these drugs. The certainty of the evidence ranges between low to very low since a small number of trials were included and the number of participants was limited. More clinical trials are therefore required to evaluate the effect and efficacy of trypanocidal drugs in late-stage, symptomatic Chagas disease and CCC.
This review looked at vaccinations targeted at the asexual (blood) phase of the parasite's life, when the parasites are in red blood cells. One vaccine for this phase, MSP/RESA (also known as Combination B), has been tested in field trials in Papua New Guinea. It reduced the density of parasites in the blood, but it did not prevent malaria attacks. Blood-stage vaccines are being actively pursued in further research.
We identified four studies including 141 participants; two of these were in children (aged six months to 14.5 years) and two did not specify the age of the participants. Those taking part in the studies received different forms of vitamin E supplements (either water-soluble or fat-soluble), placebo (a substance containing no medication) or no supplements. Three studies stated that the treatment for each person was chosen at random, but one study only said the people were split into different groups. Water-soluble vitamin E
Evidence from one study (45 participants) showed that supplementation may increase vitamin E levels in the blood after six months. Similar results were seen at the earlier time points of one month (two studies, 32 participants) and three three months (one study, 45 participants). Only one study (45 participants) reported weight at one and six months, but showed no difference between supplementation and placebo at either time point.
Fat-soluble vitamin E
Two studies (36 participants) reported higher levels of serum vitamin E after one month of fat-soluble vitamin E supplements compared with no treatment, but a different study (36 participants) did not find any difference between supplementation and no treatment after three months.
None of the studies in either comparison reported results for our planned outcomes of vitamin E total lipid ratio, the incidence of vitamin E-specific deficiency disorders, lung function or quality of life.
As the studies used different forms of supplements and different doses, it was difficult to combine the results and apply them to the wider cystic fibrosis population. The results showed that vitamin E supplementation may lead to an improvement in vitamin E levels in people with cystic fibrosis, but the quality of the evidence was low.
Future studies should look at more specific outcomes such as vitamin E status, lung function and nutritional status, especially in people already receiving treatment with pancreatic enzymes and vitamin E supplements. They could also look at the best level of vitamin E supplements needed to be most clinically effective. We judged the evidence to be low quality for the following reasons. We do not think that any of the people taking part in the studies could tell whether they received the supplements or the placebo, so that would not have affected the results; although they would have known if they were taking supplements or not taking anything. We could not tell from the information we have whether most of the studies were designed so all people had an equal chance of being in any of the groups. We also could not tell if anyone would have been able to guess in advance which group they would be in. It was also not clear if there were results reported for everyone taking part in the studies and the reasons why anyone might have dropped out of the studies. We do not know if these facts will affect our confidence in the results.
We searched medical databases for clinical studies comparing different strategies regarding the frequency of endotracheal tube suction in newborn babies on ventilators. We found only one study recruiting 97 newborns with bodyweights under 2.5 kg (these are called low birthweight infants). Suctioning was performed every six or 12 hours during the first three days of life. There were no important differences on the time the babies were on the ventilator, occurrence of pneumothorax (collapsed lung), need for ventilation or oxygen at more than 30 days, bleeding in the brain, and death in the first month of life. In addition, the study reported no side effects. We only identified one study, which was conducted in 1987 and 1988 and had several shortcomings. We cannot advise health professionals and parents about the optimal frequency of suctioning when newborns are ventilated.
We searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate. Using 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low-quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate-quality evidence), first-degree tears (low-quality evidence), second-degree tears (low-quality evidence), or third- or fourth-degree tears (very low-quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing. Fewer women in the warm-compress group experienced third- or fourth-degree tears (moderate-quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate-quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low-quality evidence), second-degree tears (very low-quality evidence), or episiotomies (low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first-degree tears (very low-quality evidence). There were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low-quality evidence), and fewer women with third- or fourth-degree tears (moderate-quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low-quality evidence), first-degree tears (very low-quality evidence), second-degree tears (very low-quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low-quality evidence). One small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first-degree tears (very low-quality evidence), but more second-degree tears (very low-quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third- or fourth-degree tears, or episiotomies (both low-quality evidence). We found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third- and fourth-degree tears). Hands-off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth.
More research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women.
We found 10 relevant studies, published between 2000 and 2016, that enrolled from 78 to 4500 adults. These studies took place in the USA (seven studies), Canada (two), and Japan (one). Five studies were conducted in doctors' offices and five in hospital clinics. People taking part in the studies were followed up for three months to two years. Two studies were funded in part by pharmaceutical companies.
The studies focused on patients with type 2 diabetes (five studies), asthma (one study), glaucoma (one study), congestive heart failure (one study), and hypertension (one study); one study focused on patients who visited their doctor for any reason.
Studies compared usual care plus access to electronic health records against usual care alone. In nine studies, access to electronic health records came with extra services.
We could not combine study results because of differences in how studies were conducted, types of patients enrolled, and how results were measured, so we had to evaluate them separately. Compared with usual care, we are uncertain whether access to electronic health records affected:
1. patients' knowledge and understanding of diabetes and of blood glucose testing (evidence from one study in 379 patients with diabetes); or
2. how often patients communicated with their healthcare provider (one study in 107 patients).
Compared with usual care, access to electronic health records may make little to no difference in:
1. patients feeling empowered (three studies; 601 patients) or satisfied with their care (three studies; 903 patients); or
2. how many patients died or reported serious unwanted effects (two studies; 486 patients).
Four studies (in 5466 patients) looked at how well patients kept up with monitoring programmes and continued to take their medicines. Although access to electronic health records may slightly improve keeping up with monitoring programmes, studies assessing how patients continued to take their medications showed different results, so we are unclear about effects of the intervention.
Accessing electronic health records may not have affected how often patients used healthcare services (three studies).
No studies reported on any unwanted effects nor on whether access to health records may have affected patients' anxiety, worry, or depression. We are not confident in our results because of the small number of studies found. Our search may have missed some relevant studies because of differences in terms used for electronic health records. In addition, we identified limitations in the ways most studies were designed or conducted. Further evidence is likely to change our results. Access to electronic health records (and extra services) may provide little to no benefit for patients' feelings of empowerment or satisfaction, nor for risk factors for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and high pressure inside the eye (a risk factor for glaucoma). Such access may slightly increase how many patients keep up with monitoring for risk factors.
Future studies should use up-to-date technologies such as mobile devices to find out:
1. effects of access to electronic health records;
2. for which groups of patients access is most suitable; and
3. which extra services should be included.
A literature search up to July 2014 found five trials (involving 4023 women with a median follow-up variable from 16 to 120 months). Since the previous version of this Cochrane review in 2004, one new study has been published. This review of trials found that follow-up programs based on a regular physical examination and a yearly mammogram appear to be as effective as the more intensive approaches and to have similar impact on HRQoL. No significant differences were found between follow-up performed by specialists or family physicians, regularly or on demand. These results should be interpreted with caution bearing in mind that these studies were conducted almost two decades ago; additional trials incorporating new biological knowledge and improved imaging technologies are needed. Allocation concealment was adequate in all but one trial; two trials were judged to be at low risk of selection bias;the blinding of the outcome assessor was not described in two trials. For one trial it was not possible to judge risk of bias because it reported no methodological information.
The latest search was done on 30th May 2016. No new studies were identified. Only one study is included in the review.
One trial (involving 176 women) was analysed which provided information on the rate of exclusive breastfeeding on discharge from hospital. We found that there was low-quality evidence that keeping mother and infant together in the same room after birth until they are discharged from the hospital increased the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at four days after birth. There was no difference between the groups in the proportion of infants receiving any breastfeeding at six months of age. We found little evidence to support or refute the practice of rooming-in after birth. A randomised controlled trial is needed and it should report all important outcomes, including breastfeeding duration.
We identified one study, which recruited 64 adults with type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Researchers compared usual care plus information leaflets with a 24-week education programme delivered once a week for 90 minutes (Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training). This programme provided basic diabetes education and information about nutrition and exercise. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years old. People in the included study were monitored for six months after the programme ended.
This evidence is up to date as of 07 March 2016. In summary, few studies have evaluated the effects of diabetes self management programmes for adults with severe mental illness. Study authors of the single included study did not report diabetes-related complications, all-cause mortality, adverse events, health-related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. They described small improvements in body mass index and body weight, as well as in diabetes knowledge and self efficacy. Current evidence is insufficient to show that these types of programmes can help people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness to better manage their diabetes and its consequences. We rated the overall quality of the evidence as very low, mainly because of the small numbers of included studies and participants, and because reported study results showed inconsistency.
At present, only three trials are available; results suggest that supplemental glutamine has no benefit for these infants.
Seven randomised controlled trials which included in all 199 participants are published. None fulfilled the presently accepted standards of a high-quality trial. All these studies have risks of bias and have a weak statistical power. Limited evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests that corticosteroids offer short-term benefit compared with placebo (dummy treatment). This supports the conclusions of observational studies and expert opinion. Limited evidence from randomised controlled trials does not show any difference in efficacy between corticosteroids and either azathioprine or intravenous immunoglobulin. All trials had design flaws which limit the strength of the conclusions. Further randomised controlled trials are needed.
First, we searched for randomized controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarized the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. We found 45 studies that involved a total of 2664 people over the age of 18 who had gum disease. The studies compared professional cleaning plus antibiotics against professional cleaning alone, or compared different antibiotics used alongside professional cleaning against one another.
We cannot tell whether antibiotics reduce gum disease in the long term (one year or more after treatment), or whether some antibiotics are better than others. This is because we have very little confidence in the evidence we found.
We cannot tell whether antibiotics are associated with unwanted effects, because we have too little confidence in the evidence. The most commonly reported unwanted effects were temporary, mild gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or a metallic taste in the mouth. No serious unwanted effects were reported.
No studies reported on antimicrobial resistance or changes in people’s quality of life. We do not know whether:
- using antibiotics alongside professional cleaning is beneficial for treating gum disease in the long term (more than one year after treatment);
- using antibiotics alongside professional cleaning is associated with unwanted effects; or
- some antibiotics are better than others for treating gum disease alongside professional cleaning.
Our confidence in the available evidence is very low. The results of our review are likely to change if more evidence becomes available. Future studies should clearly define what qualifies as a minimally important improvement in gum disease. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to March 2020.
We included 13 studies randomising 1459 adults undergoing haemodialysis. We did not find any studies in children and there were no studies in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Patients were randomised to CCBs, other medications used to treat hypertension, or placebo or standard care. Some studies were short-term (over few months) and heart-related complications were not assessed. The benefit of CCBs over other medications was unclear, possibly due to the small number of participants and the overall number of events. When compared to placebo or no treatment CCBs may decrease blood pressure before haemodialysis, although the quality of the evidence was low. The benefits of CCBs over other medications to treat hypertension could not be determined, while CCBs may lower blood pressure compared to placebo or usual care.
Does oxygen therapy delivered by small tubes into the nose reduce the incidence of low and critically low oxygen levels in the blood during the time it takes for the medical team to insert the breathing tube whilst the person is not breathing? Does this then prevent the incidence of associated complications and change the length of stay in both the hospital and intensive care unit? We searched medical databases for randomized controlled trials (a type of study where people are randomly assigned to treatment groups) of adults (aged years or older) that compared giving oxygen therapy with giving no oxygen therapy during the period between when they stopped breathing and intubation. We found 23 studies with 2264 participants. The studies were conducted in intensive care units and operating theatres in countries around the world. Pharmaceutical companies contributed funding to some studies. Compared with no oxygen therapy, oxygen therapy improved the lowest recorded blood oxygen levels slightly (by about 2%; 15 studies, 1525 participants), and reduced the duration of intensive care unit stay by about one day (5 studies, 815 people).
Oxygen therapy had no effect on the incidence of critically low oxygen levels in the blood during the non-breathing period in predominately critically ill people (15 studies, 1802 people).
There was no effect on the occurrence of complications during intubation (10 studies, 997 participants), or in the success rate of first attempt at intubation (8 studies, 826 participants).
None of our included studies reported the effect on hospital length of stay. Although we did find some benefits of oxygen therapy, we have low to moderate confidence in the results. This was mainly because the doctors in many studies were aware if the participants were receiving extra oxygen and there were differences between the groups of participants that we could not account for. It is unlikely that oxygen therapy during the non-breathing period provides much benefit to all participants in any of the measured intubation-related outcomes. Further studies might focus on length of intensive care stay and any plausible reasons for its effect, or on which groups of participants it is more helpful to. Our evidence is current to 4 November 2022.
The review authors found four randomised control trials of adequate quality evaluating the impact of zinc supplementation as an adjunct to antibiotics for pneumonia in children. These studies were conducted in Bangladesh, Nepal and India, in which 3267 children aged two to 35 months were randomly assigned to receive zinc or placebo. No serious adverse events were observed. Analysis did not show any significant effect on the clinical recovery of patients in terms of time-to-recovery from tachypnoea (respiratory rate > 50 breaths per minute) and time-to-recovery from chest indrawing. It also showed non-significant effects of the intervention on the time-to-hospital discharge. Evidence provided in this review is insufficient to recommend use of zinc as an adjunct to standard antibiotic therapy for pneumonia in children aged two to 35 months.
There has been no well-conducted review of studies examining the effects of family-centred health care delivered through primary healthcare services on the health and well-being of Indigenous children and their families. One scoping review (a brief assessment of the research and evidence) completed in 2017 found 18 evaluations on family-centred care for Indigenous children and families with three randomised controlled trials (well-designed studies that provide the best evidence) identified. As a result, we wanted to find out if family-centred care improved:
– the overall health and well-being of Indigenous children and their families;
– specific aspects of care such as physical health and development of children or the psychological health of families.
We also wanted to know how delivering family-centred care affected health service providers and the care they delivered. We searched for studies that looked at family-centred care interventions that were delivered in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA led by primary healthcare services to Indigenous children aged less than five years. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 11 studies that enrolled 1270 mother–child pairs and 1924 children aged less than five years. Most of the family-centred interventions delivered to children had different foci such as childhood obesity, behavioural problems, negative parenting patterns, and acute respiratory illness. Seven studies used education as a way of delivering family-centred care. All studies compared family-centred care interventions to usual care or a minimal control comparison. Seven studies were from the USA, two from New Zealand, one from Canada, and one from both Australia and New Zealand.
Family-centred care may improve overall health and well-being of Indigenous children and their families, but the evidence was very uncertain. There was little to no difference in psychological health and emotional behaviour of children, physical health and developmental outcomes of children, family health-enhancing lifestyle and behaviours, and psychological health of parents and carers, but the evidence was very uncertain. We are not confident in the evidence because people in the studies were aware of what intervention they were getting, and many people did not come back to report their results. Not all the studies reported the information we were interested in. Studies that did report on the data we were interested in were very specific to that particular study, so we had to make some assumptions about whether the data were applied to all families. The evidence is up to date to 22 September 2021.
The review of trials found that men using PGE1 reported more satisfactory sexual experiences. Higher doses gave greater benefits but also increased the adverse effects. The most common adverse effect is some pain, and men may prefer the urethral medication rather than injections.
In June 2020, we reviewed the evidence. We found 27 randomised clinical trials (trials where participants are allocated to groups at random) involving 1828 participants. Three trials investigated total shunt (164 participants); five trials investigated distal splenorenal shunt (352 participants); and 19 trials investigated transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (1312 participants). The source of funding was unclear in 16 trials. Eleven trials were funded by the government or received grants from local hospitals or universities. Evidence suggesting whether shunt treatments compared with endoscopic treatments with or without further medications alter the overall risk of death from any cause (all-cause mortality), reduce the risk of bleeding from varices, or reduce the risk of dying from bleeding varices (death due to variceal bleeding) was very uncertain.
Evidence that people treated with shunts compared with endoscopic treatments with or without further medications are at increased risk of acute hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction associated with liver disease) or chronic hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction that occurs repeatedly or does not fully improve) was also very uncertain.
We could not conclude with certainty whether people treated with shunt stayed in hospital longer than people treated with endoscopy with or without further medications, or which treatment was more expensive, as we were not confident that combining the results from different studies would produce a meaningful result. No trials reported on the impact of treatments on patient quality of life. The results of our analyses must be interpreted with caution due to concerns about the quality of included trials. Weaknesses in the design of these studies could influence results, making them potentially misleading. We cannot say for sure that portosystemic shunts when compared with endoscopic treatment associated sometimes with medical treatment modify the risk of overall death (all-cause mortality), reduce the risk of repeated episodes of bleeding, or increase the risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy. We need properly conducted trials assessing important outcomes for people with cirrhosis and health providers.
We found 18 studies with multiple study arms including a total of 10,680 participants. The studies lasted between one year and approximately 11 years. They compared metformin with:— insulin injections (two studies);— other medicines that lower blood sugar levels: sulphonylureas (seven studies); thiazolidinediones (seven studies); dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (three studies); a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue (one study); a meglitinide (one study);— no treatment (two studies).
No study compared metformin with a placebo or with diet or exercise programmes. Almost all studies investigated laboratory measurements of blood sugar control like fasting blood glucose. However, there was few information on patient-important outcomes such as death, serious unwanted events, health-related quality of life, death from cardiovascular causes, and non-fatal complications of diabetes when comparing metformin with other medicines that lower blood sugar levels, placebo or no intervention. The available data did not show any clear benefit or harm of metformin.
Four ongoing studies with 5824 participants will report one or more of our outcomes of interest andwill be completed between 2018 and 2024. Furthermore, 24 studies with 2369 participants could be used in a future update of our review once results are published. All the studies in this review were poorly conducted. The number of participants in most treatment comparisons was small. Even if studies reported some data we have very little confidence in the results of the comparisons. Future studies may substantially change our findings. This evidence is up to date as of 2 December 2019.
We found six studies involving 535 healthcare practitioners. The studies examined strategies encouraging practitioners to use EHI when caring for patients. We measured practitioners' use of EHI by counting the number of times they logged onto it; by measuring whether or not practitioners' followed the guidance provided by EHI; and by improvements experienced by patients. The studies compared the following strategies: EHI versus printed information (one study); EHI on a "mobile" (e.g. laptop computer) versus a stationary, desktop computer (one study); EHI presented with different search interfaces (an interface is what a user sees when accessing an online resource, think of Google versus Yahoo) (one study); and EHI provided with training (three studies). The results of this review showed that when provided with a combination of EHI and training, practitioners used the information more often. Two studies measured doctors' use of electronic treatment guidelines, but showed that the electronic aspect of the guidelines did not mean that doctors followed the guidelines. This review provided no information on whether more frequent use of EHI translated into improved clinical practice or whether patients were better off when doctors or nurses used health information when treating them. All included studies were randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), which are considered high-quality sources of evidence. However, three of the four comparisons that we examined were supported by only one study each and single studies do not typically produce high-quality evidence. Overall, we rate the body of evidence in this review as low quality.
We wanted to find out if giving children zinc supplements helps prevent child death and disease, and promotes growth. We searched for studies that randomly assigned children aged 6 months to 12 years to receive zinc supplementation or no zinc.
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 96 studies in the review, with 219,584 children. Studies took place in 34, mainly low- to middle-income countries. Most of the children in the studies were under five years old. Zinc was most commonly given as a syrup (zinc sulfate), and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily.
We found that giving children zinc supplementation might lead to a small to no reduction in the risk of death for any reason and the risk of death due to diarrhea. The risk of death due to lower respiratory tract infections or malaria may be reduced. Children given zinc experienced less disease due to diarrhea than children not given zinc; however, zinc does not seem to reduce children's risk of respiratory infection. Zinc supplementation may have a small positive effect on growth. Children who take zinc supplementation may experience vomiting as an unwanted effect. We are confident about our results on the effects of zinc supplements on reducing the risk of death due to any cause, illness due to respiratory infection, and occurrence of vomiting after supplementation. Our confidence in the results for our other outcomes was moderate because relatively few studies reported these outcomes and because studies sometimes reported different results from other studies for the same outcomes. This review updates a previous version published in 2014. The evidence is current to February 2022.
We collected data from eight randomized controlled trials addressing this issue and enrolling a total of 2515 patients. We found that D2 lymphadenectomy can reduce the number of deaths due to disease progression as compared to D1 lymphadenectomy. However, D2 lymphadenectomy was also associated with a higher rate of postoperative mortality. In addition, available evidence does not support the superiority of D3 versus D2 lymphadenectomy. In conclusion, our findings support the use of D2 lymphadenectomy in patients with resectable carcinoma of the stomach, although the increased incidence of postoperative mortality reduces its therapeutic effect. The quality of the evidence was moderate due to an intermediate level of result heterogeneity across the included trials.
Currently there are no studies available. Research is needed to assess the effect of using the charts in different settings and for both fundal height and ultrasound measurements on the health of women and their babies and should include important outcomes such as mortality.
We wanted to find out if zinc was better than placebo at reducing the risk of developing a cold and shortening the duration of existing colds. A placebo is a substance similar in appearance to a treatment, but that has no known therapeutic effect. Placebos help assess the effects of the belief that a treatment has been received versus treatment actually being received.
We also wanted to find out if zinc was associated with any adverse effects (e.g. harms), especially harms considered to be potential complications of the common cold. Additionally, we looked at self-reported overall cold severity, individual symptom severity, individual symptom duration, and days missed from work or school. We searched six databases and two clinical trials registers for studies comparing zinc with placebo for the treatment or prevention of the common cold in adults and children. We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and we found and rated our confidence in the evidence based on specific factors such as risk of bias and study methods. We found 34 studies of cold prevention or treatment. The studies were conducted in 13 countries, a majority taking place in the USA. Twelve studies were conducted on children (aged under 18 years) and 22 studies were conducted on adults. Most treatments ended with self-reported resolution of symptoms, and the minimum treatment period was five days with a maximum period of 540 days. Most of the studies were funded by an organisation with ties to related commerce/industry or did not report their funding. The remainder were funded by private clinics, non-government foundations, universities, or governmental entities.
We assessed the effects of:
- zinc as a preventative measure; and
- zinc as a treatment measure.
We obtained the following results:
Zinc for prevention
Compared with placebo, taking zinc may make little to no difference in preventing people from catching a cold (9 studies, 1449 people). Preventative zinc also probably makes little to no difference to the length of the cold if one has been caught (3 studies, 740 participants) and may make little to no difference to the severity of the symptoms experienced (2 studies, 101 people). Negative side effects were reported by people taking either zinc or placebo; irregularities in taste and stomach upset were the most common.
Zinc for treatment
Zinc taken for treatment of a cold may reduce the length of time that symptoms are present, by approximately two days, when compared with placebo (8 studies, 972 people). However, we have little confidence in the evidence supporting this conclusion. It is unclear whether zinc makes a difference to the severity of the cold symptoms experienced (2 studies, 261 people). Negative side effects were reported more frequently for those taking zinc as a cold treatment when compared to those taking placebo; irregularities in taste and stomach upset were the most common. Studies administering intranasal zinc did not report any cases of anosmia (loss of sense of smell) but information about specific side effects is uncertain. Our confidence in the evidence is mostly low to very low, and the results of further research could differ from the results of this review. Several factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, some studies did not report adequately on how people in the studies were randomly placed into treatment groups, meaning that differences between the study groups could be due to differences between the participants and not the treatments. Secondly, some studies used widely different ways of delivering treatments. Finally, due to the large differences between studies in the approaches used to test the effectiveness of zinc, it is likely that additional studies are required before any firm conclusions can be drawn. The evidence is current to 22 May 2023.
We looked for studies which compared steroid injections in the ear with placebo in patients with Ménière's disease or syndrome. Only one study satisfied the prespecified inclusion criteria for this review. This study demonstrated a benefit of this treatment for patients with Ménière's disease; at 24 months the patients in the treatment group had far fewer episodes of vertigo. The results of this review are encouraging, however as it is based solely on the results of a single study, further research is required.
The evidence is current to September 2015. We found and included 57 studies involving 3002 people with aphasia in our review. We reviewed all SLT types, regimens, and methods of delivery. Based on 27 studies (and 1620 people with aphasia), speech and language therapy benefits functional use of language, language comprehension (for example listening or reading), and language production (speaking or writing), when compared with no access to therapy, but it was unclear how long these benefits may last.
There was little information available to compare SLT with social support. Information from nine trials (447 people with aphasia) suggests there may be little difference in measures of language ability. However, more people stopped taking part in social support compared with those that attended SLT.
Thirty-eight studies compared two different types of SLT (involving 1242 people with aphasia). Studies compared SLT that differed in therapy regimen (intensity, dosage and duration), delivery models (group, one-to-one, volunteer, computer-facilitated), and approach. We need more information on these comparisons. Many hours of therapy over a short period of time (high intensity) appeared to help participants' language use in daily life and reduced the severity of their aphasia problems. However, more people stopped attending these highly intensive treatments (up to 15 hours a week) than those that had a less intensive therapy schedule. Generally, the quality of the studies conducted and reported could be improved. Key quality features were only reported by half of the latest trials. Thus, it is unclear whether this was the result of poorly conducted studies or poorly reported studies. Most comparisons we made would benefit from the availability of more studies involving more people with aphasia.
CBT is significantly more effective than no therapy in reducing symptoms of anxiety in children and young people.
No clear evidence indicates that one way of providing CBT is more effective than another (e.g. in a group, individually, with parents).
CBT is no more effective than other 'active therapies' such as self-help books.
The small number of studies meant the review authors could not compare CBT with medication.
Only four studies looked at longer-term outcomes after CBT. No clear evidence showed maintained improvement in symptoms of anxiety among children and young people. The review authors recommend that future research should look in greater detail at what makes CBT work best for children and young people, how CBT can be provided in the most cost-effective way, and how CBT can be adapted for different age groups.
We found 24 trials that randomly assigned participants to take either an ARB or control substance (placebo or ACEI). These trials evaluated ARBs in 25,051 patients with heart failure and followed them for 2 years. ARBs were no better than placebo or ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of death, disability, or hospital admission for any reason. However, more patients stopped treatment early with ARBs than with placebo due to side effects. Adding an ARB to an ACEI also did not reduce the risk of death, disability, or hospital admission for any reason as compared to ACEI alone, although more patients taking the combination stopped early due to side effects.
This review assessed the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects that single dose oral dextropropoxyphene taken alone or in combination with paracetamol had in treating moderate to severe postoperative pain. The combination of dextropropoxyphene 65 mg with paracetamol 650 mg showed similar efficacy to that of tramadol 100 mg for single dose studies in postoperative pain but with a lower incidence of side effects. This review also highlighted that Ibuprofen 400 mg was yet more effective than both tramadol 100 mg and dextropropoxyphene 65 mg.
There was a trend towards an increase in live birth and pregnancy rates during and within three months of gonadotrophin treatment. The quality of the evidence was very low. We did not find enough studies to allow final conclusions about the use of gonadotrophins in the treatment of men with idiopathic male factor subfertility. The quality of the evidence was very low. More studies on this subject are needed. The evidence is current to January 2013.
Herbal preparations are commonly used alternatives to drug treatment, surgery, or both. This systematic review included 21 randomised clinical trials involving 2222 women with uterine fibroids. There is no evidence on the effectiveness of herbal preparations for symptom relief as no trials evaluated this properly. Compared with conventional medication, one herbal preparation, Tripterygium wilfordii, may have a more beneficial effect in reducing the volume of uterine fibroids. Another five herbal medicines appeared to be similar to conventional medication in reducing the volume of fibroids. The herbal medicine Guizhi Fuling formula showed a significantly greater effect in reducing the volume of the fibroids when combined with mifepristone versus mifepristone alone. However, these clinical trials were small in terms of the number of participants and the trial quality was low. Thirteen out of 21 included trials reported on adverse effects of herbal preparations and found some minor problems such as stomach discomfort, nausea, hot flushes, and poor appetite although no serious adverse effects were identified. The effect of herbal preparations for uterine fibroids is therefore not confirmed in this review and needs to be studied in large, good quality trials.
We conducted a comprehensive search for studies on this topic. We collected data from all studies addressing this question and summarised them to determine whether antibiotics could prevent infection after surgery, whether this treatment has any adverse effects, whether it reduces the number of days that patients need to be in the hospital and whether it improves overall health status.
We found 11 studies. Overall, long-term antibiotics reduce the risk of SSI, and there is uncertainty regarding the effects of receiving one dose of antibiotics preoperatively versus short term antibiotics. There was no investigation of side effects of antibiotics in these studies, but in the studies where side effects were investigated, no side effects were found. None of the other effects of interest to clinicians or patients were measured in the studies, and information was insufficient to show whether any single antibiotic is better than any other.
We looked for trials of oral protein calorie supplements compared to usual treatment or no alternative treatment where the children took the supplements for at least one month. The review included four trials with 187 children; in three of these the children had cystic fibrosis and in one they had cancer. Studies lasted from three months to one year. We recorded the results and judged whether the trials were at risk of being biased based on the design or the way it was run. We looked at outcomes such as weight and height, calorie intake, behaviour and also side effects. One study (with 58 children) showed increases in the total calories consumed at both six and 12 months. None of the other outcomes we looked at showed any difference between treatments. This is an updated version of the review, which found no conclusive evidence to support the use of oral protein supplements. We suggest that at least one high quality trial be conducted.Therefore, we suggest that these products are used sparingly and with caution. Overall the included studies had a low risk of bias, except for two studies in which it was possible that the organisers knew which treatment group in which the children would be placed. These issues are unlikely to change the results as knowing which treatment one receives is unlikely to affect the results of body measurements (e.g. weight, height outcomes). All planned outcomes were reported on, with the exception of one study that did not report on eating behaviour and lipase intake which were measured. The quality of the results for the eating behaviour assessment was questionable and many of the children did not return the food diaries from which the lipase intake could be calculated.
The researchers identified six studies that included a total of 2324 participants. Two studies compared briakinumab to placebo (a fake medicine) and four studies compared ustekinumab to placebo. All of the studies were high quality.
There was no difference in the proportion of briakinumab and placebo participants who achieved remission. An increase in side effects or severe side effects were not seen with briakinumab compared to placebo. The most common side effects in briakinumab participants were reactions at the site of injection and infections. Based on the results of these two studies the manufacturers of briakinumab stopped production of this medication.
High quality evidence suggests that ustekinumab is better than placebo for helping participants achieve remission and for reducing symptoms of active Crohn's disease. Different doses of ustekinumab were investigated and moderate to high quality suggests that 6.0 mg/kg is the most effective dose. An increase in side effects or serious side effects was not seen with ustekinumab compared to placebo. Infections were the most common adverse event in ustekinumab patients. Worsening of Crohn's disease and serious infections were the most common serious side effects in the ustekinumab studies. Ustekinumab is a promising as a therapy for inducing remission and improving symptoms in people with Crohn's disease. Further studies are required to determine the long-term effectiveness and safety of ustekinumab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. The ideal dose of ustekinumab also needs to be determined.
Study characteristics: Four trials, in which a total of 1800 infants participated, examined whether giving VLBW infants a drug to prevent fungi growing on the skin or in the gut reduced the risk of bloodstream or other severe infection. The trials used one of two commonly available drugs (nystatin or miconazole) and compared these with either a placebo ("dummy" drug) or no drug. These trials, however, had some design weaknesses that make it less certain that their results can be taken at face value.
Key results: The overall analysis suggested that this treatment might reduce severe infection rates in VLBW infants but there was no evidence of a reduction in the risk of dying.
Conclusions: Larger and higher quality trials are needed to resolve this uncertainty.
We found two small studies demonstrating an improvement of muscle strength with pinacidil and acetazolamide. There was only one trial considering treatment of paralytic attacks, demonstrating a decrease in the severity and frequency of the attacks using diclorophenamide.
We did not find other randomised or quasi-randomised studies, but only case reports and anecdotal articles using other drugs to reduce paralyses attacks. Further research is needed to determine the best treatment for reducing the frequency and severity of attacks and to treat or prevent permanent muscle weakness.
We found seven randomised trials involving 138 participants, which provided data on 123. All were male, aged between 16 and 68 years. Offending ranged from very serious (e.g., rape) to minor criminality (e.g., exhibitionism). Comparators included placebo (five studies), psychological treatment (one study), and a combination of psychological and pharmacological treatment (one study). Five studies took place in the community and two in a secure hospital. Duration varied between three and 13 months.
Six studies examined the effectiveness of three testosterone-suppressing drugs: cyproterone acetate (CPA), ethinyl oestradiol (EO), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). In two of these studies, MPA was given alongside a psychological therapy (assertiveness training or imaginal desensitisation). The seventh study assessed the effectiveness of two antipsychotics (benperidol and chlorpromazine) versus placebo. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of interventions, comparator groups, study designs, and other issues. Two studies reported reoffending rates formally. One trial of intramuscular MPA plus imaginal desensitisation (ID) found no reoffending at two-year follow-up for the intervention group (n = 10 versus one relapse within the group treated by ID alone). A three-armed trial of oral MPA, alone or in combination with psychological treatment, reported a 20% rate of reoffending amongst those in the combined treatment arm (n = 15) and 50% of those in the psychological treatment only group (n = 12). Notably, all those in the 'oral MPA only' arm (n = 5) dropped out immediately, despite treatment being court mandated. Two studies did not report reoffending rates as they both took place in a secure psychiatric facility from which none were discharged. Three community studies did not formally report reoffending at all, focusing largely on 'abnormal sexual activity'.
Secondary outcomes: Studies reported a variety of secondary outcomes. Results suggested that the frequency of self reported deviant sexual fantasies may be reduced by testosterone-suppressing drugs, but not the deviancy itself. Where measured, hormonal levels, particularly levels of testosterone, tended to correlate with measures of sexual activity and anxiety. One study measured anxiety formally; one study measured anger/aggression.
Adverse events: Six studies provided information on adverse events and none tested the effects of testosterone-suppressing drugs beyond six to eight months. The most severe were reported in a trial of antipsychotic medication. Reported side effects in two trials of oral MPA and CPA included considerable weight gain. Side effects of intramuscular MPA led to discontinuation in some participants. Important increases in depression and excess salivation were reported in one trial of oral MPA. No deaths and no suicide attempts were reported in any study.
We conclude that these seven trials (published more than 20 years ago), examining only a limited number of drugs, provide a poor evidence base to guide practice. Not only were the trials small, they were of short duration, included varied participants, and none trialled the newer drugs currently in use, particularly SSRIs or GnRH analogues. The results of this review, therefore, do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding pharmacological interventions as an effective intervention for reducing sexual offending.
New studies are needed that address these deficits. Data should also be collected on the characteristics of those who refuse, drop out, and complete treatment. Overall, the quality of the evidence was poor. We had concerns about: number of participants leaving studies, blinding of those who measured outcomes, ways in which investigators concealed allocation of treatment to those delivering it, and reporting of our primary outcome: reoffending.
This review compares the efficacy of psychoeducation added to standard care as a means of helping severely mentally ill people with that of standard care alone. The evidence shows a significant reduction of relapse or readmission rates. There seems to be some suggestion that psychoeducation may improve compliance with medication, but the extent of improvement remains unclear. The findings show a possibility that psychoeducation has a positive effect on a person's well being and promotes better social function. In the medium term, treating four people with schizophrenia with psychoeducation instead of standard care resulted in one additional person showing a clinical improvement. The scarcity of studies made the comparison between the efficacy of different formats (programmes of 10 sessions or less or 11 or more, individual or group sessions) weak.
Studies measured agitated behaviour with various scales and the reliability of the evidence for the different scales ranged from moderate to very low. Overall, we found no evidence that valproate preparations improved behaviour, or specifically, agitated behaviour. We found that valproate preparations probably had little or no effect on participants' ability to perform daily activities. We could not be sure whether they had an effect on cognition (thinking and remembering) because the reliability of the evidence was very low.
We found low-reliability evidence from three studies that participants taking valproate may be more likely than those taking placebo to experience harmful effects. We could not be as certain about differences in serious harms, such as serious illness or admission to hospital, but data from two studies suggested that these may be more common in the participants taking valproate. Some of the side effects associated with valproate were sleepiness, feeling sick, being sick, watery stools, and urinary tract infections. We only identified five relatively small studies for inclusion in this review. They varied in their methods, type of medicine and its dose, duration of treatment, and scales used to make measurements. This limited our ability to pool data across studies. However, we could be moderately confident in the conclusion that valproate preparations do not improve agitated behaviour in dementia. They may also be associated with harmful effects.
A systematic overview of randomised trials does not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether thyroid hormone treatment of preterm infants with transiently low thyroid hormone levels results in changes in neonatal outcomes or reductions in developmental impairments. Extremely premature infants frequently have transiently low thyroid hormone levels in the first weeks after birth. These low thyroid hormone levels are associated with an increased incidence of complications and death in the newborn period and longer term developmental impairments. Thyroid hormone therapy might prevent these problems. One small trial comparing thyroid hormone treatment to no treatment of infants with transiently low thyroid hormone levels reported no benefit from treatment of these infants. However, this is insufficient evidence to determine if thyroid hormone treatment is effective. Further research is needed.
This review identified eight randomized controlled trials involving 733 women. Low quality evidence showed increases in ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates with the use of the brief co-incubation protocol. More studies are needed to assess whether brief co-incubation would contribute to a higher live-birth rate and a lower miscarriage rate compared to the standard overnight insemination protocol.
We found seven studies enrolling 719 participants, mostly in females who experience recurrent UTIs (at least 2 episodes in 6 months or 3 episodes in 12 months) on a long-term basis. We could not combine the data because each study investigated different D-mannose preparations, different populations, and different control groups. We were unable to determine if taking D-mannose compared to no treatment, other supplements, or antibiotics reduced the number of repeated UTIs. Only a small number of participants experienced diarrhoea or vaginal burning as a side effect.
The quality of the evidence is poor. Studies were conducted using poor-quality methods and did not enrol enough patients. Only two out of the seven studies blinded the participants to the treatment they receive. There is not enough evidence to know whether D-mannose prevents or treats acute or recurrent UTIs.
In this review we included two randomised trials comparing planned caesarean versus planned vaginal birth for twin pregnancies which together included 2864 women. For important outcomes the evidence was assessed as being of moderate quality.
For maternal mortality no events were reported in one trial and two deaths (one in each group) in the other. There was no clear evidence of differences between women randomised to planned caesarean or planned vaginal birth for death or serous illness in either the mothers or babies. No studies reported childhood disability.
The number of women undergoing caesarean section was reported in both trials. Most women in the planned caesarean group had treatment as planned (90.9%), whereas in the planned vaginal birth group 42.9% had caesarean section for at least one twin. There were no significant differences between groups for failure to breastfeed or for postnatal depression.
There is very little clear research evidence to provide guidance on the method of birth for twin pregnancies. The benefits and risks should be made available to women, including short-term and long-term consequences for both mother and babies. Future research should aim to provide more clarity on this issue as medical interventions in the birth process should be avoided unless there is reasonable clinical certainty that they will be of long-term benefit.
After searching for all relevant studies to 3 February 2015, we found 27 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1767 participants, of a duration ranging from two weeks to one year. Pain
• People who received intra-articular corticosteroids rated improvement in their pain to be about 3 on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain) after 1 month.
• People who received a placebo rated improvement in their pain to be about 2 on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain) after 1 month.
Another way of saying this is:
• 44 people out of 100 who receive intra-articular corticosteroids respond to treatment (44%).
• 31 people out of 100 who receive a placebo respond to treatment (31%).
• 13 more people respond to treatment with intra-articular corticosteroids than with placebo (difference of 13%).
Note that these numbers may considerably overestimate the true benefit due to the low quality of the evidence.
Physical function
• People who received intra-articular corticosteroids rated improvement in their physical function to be about 2 on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 10 (extreme disability) after 1 month.
• People who received a placebo rated improvement in their physical function to be about 1 on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 10 (extreme disability) after 1 month.
Another way of saying this is:
• 36 people out of 100 who received intra-articular corticosteroids respond to treatment (36%).
• 26 people out of 100 who received a placebo respond to treatment (26%).
• 10 more people respond to treatment with intra-articular corticosteroids than with placebo (difference of 10%).
Note that these numbers may considerably overestimate the true benefit due to the low quality of the evidence.
Side effects
• 13 people out of 100 who used intra-articular corticosteroids experienced side effects (13%).
• 15 people out of 100 who used a placebo experienced side effects (15%).
• 2 more people experienced side effects with placebo than with intra-articular corticosteroids (difference of 2%).
Dropouts because of side effects
• 6 people out of 1000 who used intra-articular corticosteroids dropped out because of side effects (0.6%).
• 17 people out of 1000 who used a placebo dropped out because of side effects (1.7%).
• 11 more people dropped out because of side effects with placebo than with intra-articular corticosteroids (difference of 1.1%).
Side effects resulting in hospitalisation, persistent disability, or death
• 3 people out of 1000 who used intra-articular corticosteroids experienced side effects resulting in hospitalisation, persistent disability, or death (0.3%).
• 4 people out of 1000 who used a placebo experienced side effects resulting in hospitalisation, persistent disability, or death(0.4%).
• 1 more person experienced side effects resulting in hospitalisation, persistent disability, or death with placebo than with intra-articular corticosteroids (difference of 0.1%).
Based on the evidence, intra-articular corticosteroids may cause a moderate improvement in pain and a small improvement in physical function, but the quality of the evidence is low and results are inconclusive. Intra-articular corticosteroids appear to cause as many side effects as a placebo. However, we do not have precise and reliable information about side effects. We graded the quality of the evidence as low for all of our findings, which means that we have little confidence in these results. This was because results were generally highly discordant across studies and mainly based on small studies of low quality.
We identified 66 trials comparing group-based programmes to other types of support, or comparing different types of group programme. The most recent search was in May 2016. In 13 trials (4395 participants) people in the control conditions were provided with a self-help programme. There was a benefit for the group-based approach, with the chance of quitting increased by 50% to 130%. This means that if five in 100 people were able to quit for at least six months using self-help materials, eight to 12 in 100 might be successful if offered group support. We judged the quality of this evidence as moderate, because studies did not report methods in enough detail to exclude possible bias. There was also evidence of a benefit of group support compared to advice and brief support from a healthcare professional (14 trials, 7286 participants), although the difference was smaller and more variable. We rated this as low-quality evidence, because of the variability as well as possible risk of bias. There was also low-quality evidence of a benefit in studies that did not provide the control group with any help to quit (9 trials, 1098 participants). Six trials (980 participants) compared group format with individual face-to-face counselling; there was no sign that one approach was more helpful than the other. The remaining studies compared different types of group programmes; typically they did not show differences, so it is not possible to show which components of group-based programmes are most helpful.
Six trials which investigated the effect of ketanserin on 146 patients with either primary Raynaud's phenomenon or Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis were included (Cadranel 1986; Dormandy 1988; Kirch 1987; Lukac 1985; Ortonne 1989; van de Wal 1987). Patients treated with ketanserin experienced a greater improvement in mean functional index scores and more patients improved than those treated with placebo, however they also experienced more side effects and an increase in the frequency and duration of attacks.
This review assessed a limited number of studies and therefore the conclusions reached need to be investigated further.
This review assessed data from twenty-six studies comparing paracetamol plus codeine with placebo, and fourteen studies comparing paracetamol plus codeine with the same dose of paracetamol alone. The combination provided effective pain relief for about 40% of participants experiencing moderate to severe pain after an operation with 600 to 650 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, the dose most commonly used in these studies, and about 50% of participants with 800 to 1000 mg paracetamol plus 60 mg codeine, the dose most commonly used in clinical practice. The addition of codeine provided effective pain relief to about 10% more participants than the same dose of paracetamol alone. These single dose studies did not associate paracetamol plus codeine with any serious side effects.
Randomised controlled studies compare treatments to find out if they are truly effective. We searched for randomised studies comparing non-invasive ventilation to routine care for adults with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. We compared studies treating people with non-invasive ventilation versus medical care. Medical care includes therapies such as providing extra oxygen and water pills to patients. The evidence upon which this review is based is current to September 2018. We sought to address if non-invasive ventilation in adults with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema reduces rates of deaths, the need for a breathing tube, and heart attacks. We found 24 studies with 2664 participants comparing non-invasive ventilation to medical care alone. Non-invasive ventilation may decrease the chances of dying in hospital. The quality of results for studies reporting death in hospital was low. Studies were poorly conducted, and results were not similar across studies. In addition, non-invasive ventilation probably reduces the chances of needing a breathing tube. The quality of results for studies reporting breathing tube rates was moderate. Studies evaluating breathing tube rates were poorly conducted. Non-invasive ventilation probably has little or no effect on getting a heart attack. The quality of results for studies reporting heart attack rates was moderate, and studies had inconsistent results for this outcome. We are unsure if the length of hospital stay is improved with non-invasive ventilation. The quality of results for studies reporting hospital length of stay was very low, which was due to poor study conduct and inconsistent results. Finally, non-invasive ventilation may make little or no difference to adverse events (complications), compared to medical care. The quality of results for studies reporting adverse events was low. Studies evaluating adverse events were poorly conducted and had inconsistent results.
We reviewed 24 controlled clinical trials with 4631 participants investigating the effectiveness of several different Echinacea preparations for preventing and treating common colds or induced rhinovirus infections. Our review shows that a variety of products prepared from different Echinacea species, different plant parts and in a different form have been compared to placebo in randomized trials. Due to the significant differences in the preparations tested, it was difficult to draw strong conclusions. Five trials were rated as having a low risk of bias in all five categories of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Five more trials were rated as low risk of bias, having an unclear risk of bias in only one category. Eight trials were rated as having a high risk of bias in at least one category and the remaining six as having an unclear risk of bias.
The majority of trials investigated whether taking Echinacea preparations after the onset of cold symptoms shortens the duration, compared with placebo. Although it seems possible that some Echinacea products are more effective than a placebo for treating colds, the overall evidence for clinically relevant treatment effects is weak. In general, trials investigating Echinacea for preventing colds did not show statistically significant reductions in illness occurrence. However, nearly all prevention trials pointed in the direction of small preventive effects. The number of patients dropping out or reporting adverse effects did not differ significantly between treatment and control groups in prevention and treatment trials. However, in prevention trials there was a trend towards a larger number of patients dropping out due to adverse events in the treatment groups.
The evidence is current to July 2013.
We included three relevant studies in the review, which investigated different types of MD rehabilitation interventions after botulinum toxin injections into the arms of 91 adults with previous stroke. There was low quality evidence for intensive forced use of the affected arm in improving spasticity, and very low quality evidence for elbow splinting with occupational therapy. We did not identify any studies of MD rehabilitation in children with post-stroke spasticity or after other injected medications. The review findings are limited by the small number of studies that are methodologically flawed. More research is needed into what rehabilitation modalities and treatments are most effective for spasticity management following stroke.
Further randomised controlled trials that test for the identification of effective interventions for HIV prevention with outcomes of biological endpoints, such as HIV incidence or prevalence, are needed for these neglected populations. More research is also needed for male or transgender sex workers and their clients in high-income countries.
This review aimed to identify whether blood transfusion was a useful treatment for patients with advanced cancer who were anaemic. We identified only 12 relevant studies but all were of low quality. They indicated that fatigue and breathlessness improved immediately after the transfusion but this began to wane after a period of two weeks. Of those receiving a transfusion, 31% to 70% had a transient benefit that lasted about two weeks.
We found two randomised clinical trials (types of studies in which participants are assigned to treatment group using a random method) involving a total of 154 adult participants who received either a non-selective shunt surgery, a selective shunt surgery, or devascularisation surgery. However, the design of both trials was of insufficient quality, as the numbers of trial participants were small, and some participant information was lacking. One of the trials was funded by an institutional grant, and how funding was obtained for the other trial was not clear. We assessed both trials as at high risk of bias. There were no significant differences in the number of participants who had repeat bleeding, adverse effects of treatment, or deaths between the shunt surgery and the devascularisation group, but participants who had devascularisation were less likely to suffer encephalopathy (disease of the brain due to damage from toxins produced by the liver). Neither of the trials addressed quality of life after treatment. Given the very low certainty of the evidence due to the way the clinical trials were performed, limited trial data and trial participants, we were unable to determine whether one treatment is better than the other. We suggest that future trials include a sufficient number of randomised participants to be able to obtain meaningful results on patient-relevant outcomes and allow objective comparison of these two surgery types.
We wanted to find out if psychological therapies improve DFU healing and prevent their reappearance. We also wanted to know if they affect the number of amputations, quality of life, cost of treatment and people's belief that they can manage the condition, in addition to comparing the effects of different psychological therapies. We searched for relevant randomised controlled trials, in which the treatment each person receives is chosen at random. These studies give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. We assessed how certain the evidence was by considering factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. We found seven studies that involved 290 people with diabetes who were followed up for between six weeks and six months. The studies were conducted in Australia, the USA, Norway, Indonesia, South Africa and the UK. The psychological therapies investigated were:
- counselling (three studies);
- muscle relaxation (one study);
- individually-tailored motivation (one study);
- a therapy that aims to develop a person’s understanding of well-being (one study);
- group-based cognitive behavioural therapy (one study).
Psychological therapies compared to usual care
We do not know if psychological therapies improve healing of DFU, or prevent ulcer reappearance, because the evidence is of very low certainty.
Different psychological therapies compared to each other
We do not know if some psychological therapies have more of an effect than others on healing of DFU or preventing ulcer reappearance. This is because either no studies investigated this, or the evidence is of very low certainty.
We do not know if psychological therapies have an effect on the time it takes for ulcers to reappear, amputation, quality of life or a person’s belief in their ability to manage their condition, because there were either no or too few studies investigating this. No studies reported information about the cost of psychological therapies. There is no robust evidence about the effects of psychological therapies on DFU healing and recurrence.
There is a need for high-quality studies that include enough people to detect a potential effect of psychological therapies on ulcer healing or reappearance. It would be helpful to agree on a set of clear measures to include in all future studies, so that results from different studies could be compared and analysed together. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to September 2019.
In March 2015 we searched a wide range of medical databases and registers of medical trials to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs; these produce the most reliable results) that compared one treatment of gas gangrene with another treatment, or with no treatment. We identified two relevant RCTs with a total of 90 participants with gas gangrene.
One RCT (46 participants) compared standard treatment plus treatment with Chinese herbs to standard treatment alone (debridement and antibiotics). This RCT showed a higher cure rate in the group of participants treated with the Chinese herbs than in the group that had standard treatment alone (21/26 versus 9/20 participants respectively). The definition of 'cure' used in the trial was the proportion of participants who were cured or improved. When we restricted the definition of 'cure' to those participants who were cured (and left out those who were 'improved'), the difference in cure rate between the Chinese herb group (12/26 participants) and the standard treatment group (3/20 participants) was slightly smaller.
The other RCT (44 participants) compared standard treatment plus topical hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT; applied at the wound surface) against standard treatment plus systemic HBOT that was given to the whole body. The cure rate was higher in the group of participants who had topical HBOT than in the group that had systemic HBOT (19/21 versus 11/23 participants respectively). The definition of 'cure' used in the trial was the proportion of participants who were cured or significantly improved. When we restricted the definition of 'cure' to those participants who were cured (and left out those who were 'significantly improved'), there was little difference between the topical HBOT group (3/21 participants) and the systemic HBOT group (3/23 participants).
The quality of the evidence for both comparisons on the outcome of cure rate was very low. Neither trial reported on quality of life, amputation or death attributable to gas gangrene or harmful effects of treatment. We did not find trials that investigated any other treatments for gas gangrene. The benefits and harms of different treatments for gas gangrene remain unclear as the available trials do not provide high quality evidence, due to low sample numbers and a number of problems with the way the trials were conducted that can introduce bias to the results. Further trials or observational studies with appropriate study design, that focus on the main treatments for gas gangrene and that report on quality of life, amputation and death due to gas gangrene, and harms that may be caused by treatment are needed.
We identified 11 trials (with 3352 participants older than 12 years with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia), fully published in peer-reviewed journals, focused on treatment of pneumonia in adolescents and adults treated in the community in outpatient settings. This included five new trials included since our last review published in 2009. None of the trials included antibiotics versus placebo; all trials included one or more antibiotics. All participants were diagnosed with pneumonia based upon clinical diagnosis by the physician and chest X-ray. All included trials were well conducted; nine of the 11 trials were sponsored by bio-pharmaceutical companies manufacturing the antibiotics used in the study, or their authors were closely linked with the company. Nine of the included trials compared different antibiotics and, hence, we could not combine the results of the individual trials to present our overall conclusion. There were some notable adverse events in seven studies: 1) erythromycin demonstrated significant gastrointestinal side effects compared to clarithromycin in two studies; 2) nemonoxacin demonstrated higher gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhoea) and nervous system (dizziness, headache) adverse events compared to levofloxacin; 3) cethromycin demonstrated more side effects, especially a distortion of the sense of taste, than clarithromycin; 4) gastritis and diarrhoea were more common in the high-dose amoxicillin group (1 g three times a day) compared to the other three antibiotic groups (clarithromycin, azithromycin and levofloxacin). Unfortunately, there were not enough trials to compare the effects of different antibiotics for pneumonia acquired and treated in the community.
This review assessed if these medications would be useful in patients with diabetes. We included eight trials with 21,379 patients and a mean duration of follow-up ranging from 365 to 913 days. Specific data for patients with diabetes were only available in full for one of these trials and partial data were available for two trials. Analysis of the available data demonstrated that adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists (such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine) were not more effective than other blood thinning drugs or placebo for death from any cause, death related to cardiovascular disease, heart attacks or strokes. There was no available information on the effects of adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists on health-related quality of life, adverse effects specially for people with diabetes, or costs. The use of adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes needs to be guided by the information available from trials which included patients with and without diabetes. All future trials on adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists should include data which relate specifically to patients with diabetes in order to inform evidence-based clinical guidelines.
Six studies were identified for inclusion (four cluster RCTs, one CBA and one ITS). Four of these studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, one in India and one in Pakistan. IRS reduced malaria transmission in young children by half compared to no IRS in Tanzania (an area where people are regularly exposed to malaria), and protected all age groups in India and Pakistan (where malaria transmission is more unstable and where more than one type of malaria is found).
When compared with ITNs, IRS appeared more protective (according to the outcome chosen) in one trial conducted in an area of stable malaria transmission, but ITN seemed to be more protective than IRS in unstable areas. Unfortunately, the level of evidence is very limited and no firm conclusions should be drawn on the basis of this review.
In conclusion, although IRS programmes have shown impressive success in malaria reduction throughout the world, there are too few well-run trials to be able to quantify the effects of IRS in areas with different malaria transmission, or to properly compare IRS and ITN.  High-quality and long-duration trials on a large scale, done in areas where there has been little or no mosquito control are still urgently required. New trials should include an IRS arm and an ITN arm, and should also assess the combined effect of ITN and IRS, a very important question in view of malaria elimination.
This review assessed information from 10 studies which used celecoxib for acute pain. Just over 3 in 10 people (33%) taking celecoxib 200 mg, and over 4 in 10 (43%) taking celecoxib 400 mg, experienced good pain relief (at least 50%) compared to about 1 in 10 (range 1% to 11%) with placebo. Comparing the results of the different studies showed that the 200 mg dose of celecoxib was at least as good as aspirin 600 to 650 mg and paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1000 mg for relieving postoperative pain, while a 400 mg dose was at least as good as ibuprofen 400 mg. The number of people who experienced negative (adverse) reactions was similar for celecoxib and placebo, and stopping the medication due to these adverse reactions also occurred at similar rates. One serious adverse event, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), was probably related to celecoxib.
We identified 12 trials (2494 participants: 1586 children and 908 elderly). We looked for trials that compared amantadine or rimantadine with no intervention, placebos or control drugs in children and the elderly. The most recent searches were completed in October 2014. We looked at several outcomes, including influenza A, fever duration, cough, headache, nausea/vomiting, dizziness and stimulation/insomnia.
Although amantadine was effective in preventing influenza A in children, it would be necessary to use it in up to 17 children over a period of 14 to 18 weeks to prevent one case of influenza A. Furthermore, the safety of the drug was not well established. The quality of the evidence was low.
The effectiveness of both antivirals was limited to a benefit from rimantadine in the reduction of fever by day three of treatment in children. The quality of the evidence was moderate. This benefit does not seem to justify a recommendation for using rimantadine to treat all children with influenza A.
Rimantadine did not show a prophylactic (preventative) effect in the elderly. The quality of evidence was very low. The quality of the evidence combined with a lack of knowledge about the safety of amantadine and the limited benefits of rimantadine, do not indicate that amantadine and rimantadine compared to control (placebo or paracetamol) could be useful in preventing, treating and shortening the duration of influenza A in children and the elderly.
There are numerous different preparations available, and we have assessed how varying the dose of beclomethasone (BDP) affects asthma in this review. There was a limited amount of evidence that 800mcg/d was superior to 400mcg/d in improving morning and evening peak flow. More research into the effects of different doses of BDP is required.
In March 2018, we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs, clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing endovascular coiling with neurosurgical clipping for subarachnoid haemorrhage. We found one new RCT and additional data for previously identified RCTs, allowing us to include four RCTs involving 2458 participants. The data from RCTs showed that the number of people who survived and were independent in their daily living was higher after endovascular coiling than after neurosurgical clipping, if both treatment options were possible. Risk of rebleeding was higher in people treated with endovascular coiling. The evidence came mainly from one large trial. We judged that there is sufficient evidence to guide treatment for people in a relatively good condition whose aneurysm is considered suitable for both neurosurgical clipping and endovascular treatment. There is no reliable trial evidence that can be used directly to guide treatment in people with a poor clinical condition.
We searched the literature published up to 10 March 2015, and identified 12 studies (2298 participants) that compared conventional amphotericin B with liposomal amphotericin B. We were able to meta-analyse 10 studies (2172 participants). Study quality was assessed as moderate overall.
Liposomal amphotericin B was found to be associated with fewer kidney and infusion-related reactions than conventional amphotericin B.
Systematically, we searched the literature on psychological interventions to find valid studies that looked at the effects of providing mainly psychological interventions for adults with asthma. The studies found examined many different therapies and measured different physical and psychological outcomes; for these reasons, their results could not be easily combined. However, meta-analyses could be performed to determine the effect of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on quality of life, bio-feedback on PEF, and relaxation therapy on PEF and FEV1 and medication use. The available studies were completed with small numbers of people and the way the studies were conducted could be improved. More research with larger numbers of people and improved design needs to be done before it is known whether psychological interventions are effective in improving health outcomes for adults with asthma.
This review shows that people using Ginkgo biloba could walk 64.5 metres further, which was a non-significant difference compared with the placebo group. Overall, there is no evidence that Ginkgo biloba has a clinically significant benefit for patients with PAD.
We included 11 studies with a total of 674 participants. The participants in the studies were aged from 8 to 79. The studies were conducted in a number of countries (six from Pakistan, two from the USA, one from Taiwan and two from South Africa). All but one of the 11 studies reported the difference in recurrence rate between needle aspiration and incision and drainage. Four studies compared symptom scores associated with the procedure and two studies compared time to resumption of normal diet. Three studies reported adverse effects/events associated with the intervention. Two studies reported complications of the disease process itself.
The evidence is current to August 2016. Ten studies reported on the recurrence of peritonsillar abscess (our main outcome). Most of them did not clearly define 'recurrence' and they varied in the timing of its assessment, however we were able to combine (pool) the data from these studies. When we pooled the data the recurrence rate was higher in the needle aspiration group compared with incision and drainage. It is important to note that the evidence for this outcome was of very low quality. Some studies found that patients had more pain when they had incision and drainage. We identified problems or potential problems in all of the included studies. The most important of these was that the studies did not all assess recurrence in the same way, at the same time, using the same criteria. The quality of the evidence for all of the outcomes that we looked at was very low.
This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012 (Adams 2012). Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that is prescribed to prevent adverse cardiovascular events and to lower blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. It is therefore important to know the magnitude of the effect that atorvastatin has on cholesterol. We searched for all evidence obtained from three- to 12-week trials reporting the effect of atorvastatin on blood cholesterol. This update found 42 additional trials and reports on 296 trials in 38,817 participants. Atorvastatin showed a consistent effect in lowering blood cholesterol over the dose range of 2.5 to 80 mg daily. The effect was greater with higher doses than with lower doses. Atorvastatin works similarly to rosuvastatin in lowering cholesterol but is about three-fold less potent. Risk of bias for all assessed trials was high. Review authors were unable to assess harms of atorvastatin because the included trials were too short, and because only 34 included trials assessed harms.
We included 38 studies (11,181 women), reporting three types of diagnoses from the frozen section test.
1. Cancer, which occurred in an average of 29% of women.
2. Borderline tumour, which occurred in 8% of women.
3. Benign mass.
In a hypothetical group of 1000 patients where 290 have cancer and 80 have a borderline tumour, 261 women would receive a correct diagnosis of a cancer and 706 women would be correctly diagnosed without a cancer based on a frozen section result. However, 4 women would be incorrectly diagnosed as having a cancer where none existed (false positive), and 29 women with cancer would be missed and potentially need further treatment (false negative).
If surgeons used a frozen section result of either a cancer or a borderline tumour to diagnose cancer, 280 women would be correctly diagnosed with a cancer and 635 women would be correctly diagnosed without a cancer. However, 75 women would be incorrectly diagnosed as having a cancer, and 10 women with cancer would be missed on the initial test and found to have a cancer after surgery.
If the frozen section result reported the mass as benign or malignant, the final diagnosis would remain the same in, on average, 94% and 99% of the cases, respectively.
In cases where the frozen section diagnosis was a borderline tumour, there is a chance that the final diagnosis would turn out to be a cancer in, on average, 21% of women. Where the frozen section diagnosis is a borderline tumour, the diagnosis is less accurate than for benign or malignant tumours. Surgeons may choose to perform additional surgery in this group of women at the time of their initial surgery in order to reduce the need for a second operation if the final diagnosis turns out to be a cancer, as it would on average in one out of five of these women.
Our evidence comes from 32 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 3284 women from 11 countries. The trials compared different ways of reducing the incidence (number of times STP occurred) or severity of STP in women undergoing gynaecological laparoscopy. The evidence is up to date to 8 August 2018. Women having gynaecological laparoscopy may have less STP or need fewer pain killers following several interventions: a specific technique for releasing the pneumoperitoneum; leaving fluid or local anaesthetic (liquid pain killers) in the abdomen or putting a drain from the inside to the outside of the abdomen for a period of time.
There is low to moderate-quality evidence that the following interventions may not make a difference to the incidence or severity of STP: local anaesthetic (liquid pain killers) placed only in the upper part of the abdomen underneath the diaphragm; warmed and moistened carbon dioxide gas.
There is low-quality evidence that gasless laparoscopy may increase the severity of STP, compared with standard treatment.
Few studies reported side effects (adverse events) and some potentially useful interventions have not been studied by RCTs of gynaecological laparoscopy.
We are cautious about these results because the evidence from the studies that we found was not good quality (low to moderate-quality evidence). The studies in this review did not use the best methods to gather and report their evidence and we thought the evidence was only low to moderate quality. This means that we cannot be very confident in the results.
This is an update of an earlier review. The evidence is current to September 2015. We only identified one new study with 2305 participants. In total, we analysed four randomised controlled studies with 4187 participants. The comparison of warfarin with aspirin was based on a large number of patients from four high-quality studies. The analysis showed an almost identical risk of death with both drugs. There was not enough evidence to prove benefits of warfarin over aspirin to reduce the possibility of clotting complications, such as a heart attack or stroke. However, patients receiving warfarin experienced serious bleeding twice as often as those taking aspirin. A comparison of warfarin with another antiplatelet drug, clopidogrel, was based on a single medium size study, and it showed similar results: no difference in occurrence of death or clotting complications, but a higher chance of developing of a serious bleed. There is currently no evidence to suggest advantages of warfarin over antiplatelet drugs in heart failure with a normal rhythm. Moreover, treatment with warfarin leads to more bleeding events than aspirin or clopidogrel. It is unlikely that further studies will change these conclusions unless new, more effective and safe drugs become available.
This review compares the effectiveness of three inhaled steroids. Fluticasone (FP) was compared with either beclomethasone (BDP) or budesonide (BUD) for treating people with chronic asthma. When FP was given to children or adults at approximately half the daily dose of either BDP or BUD, it appeared to be at least as effective as the other two drugs in improving airway opening. There was not enough information available to draw conclusions concerning the effect of these drugs on symptoms, or the risk of an acute asthma exacerbation. When given at the same dose as BDP or BUD, FP treated participants had slightly better lung function. However, at the same dose FP was also associated with increased hoarseness, although it did not lead to increased incidences of other side-effects associated with steroids such as oral thrush or sore throat.
Hysterectomy (simple (womb and cervix) or radical (womb, cervix and surrounding tissues)) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus radiotherapy alone
By combining results from three studies that assessed 571 women, we found that fewer women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus hysterectomy died than those who received radiotherapy alone. However, many women in the first group also had radiotherapy. There was no difference in the number of women who were disease-free after treatment.
Hysterectomy (radical) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy alone
We combined the results of two studies that assessed 1253 women. We found no difference in the risk of death between women who received hysterectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and those who received chemoradiotherapy alone.
Side effects were not well reported. Results of single trials showed no differences in severe side effects between groups in any comparison. Limited data suggested that the interventions appeared to be reasonably well tolerated, although more evidence is needed.
Studies did not report how women's quality of life was affected. We found insufficient evidence that hysterectomy added to radiotherapy and chemoradiation improved survival, quality of life or side effects in women with locally advanced cervical cancer compared with medical treatment alone. Overall, the quality of the evidence was variable and we had concerns about risk of bias. More trials assessing medical management with and without hysterectomy may test the robustness of the findings of this review. Further data from carefully planned trials assessing medical management with and without hysterectomy are likely to impact on how confident we are about these findings.
Researchers have studied the ability of various drug treatments to prevent the development of chronic pain after surgery and this systematic review evaluated published studies in this field. Available studies suggest a modest effect of ketamine, compared to placebo, for prevention of chronic pain after surgery, however small study size could lead to an overestimation of this effect. Studies of other drugs such as gabapentin and pregabalin did not suggest the same preventative effect. Additional large studies using improved research methods are necessary to more clearly identify treatments that are beneficial for preventing chronic postsurgical pain.
There are beds, mattresses and mattress toppers specifically designed for people at risk of pressure ulcers. These can be made of a range of materials (such as foam, air cells or water bags) and are divided into two groups:
- reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin, unless a person moves or is repositioned; and
- active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body.
We wanted to find out if reactive, air-filled surfaces:
- prevent pressure ulcers;
- are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
- have health benefits that outweigh their costs; and
- have any unwanted effects. We searched the medical literature for studies that evaluated the effects of beds, mattresses and mattress toppers with a reactive, air-filled surface. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 17 studies (2604 people, average age: 72 years) that lasted between five days and six months (average: 14 days). The studies compared reactive, air-filled surfaces with:
- foam surfaces;
- active, air-filled surfaces; and
- reactive surfaces filled with water, gel or other materials.
Pressure ulcer prevention
The evidence suggests that fewer people may develop pressure ulcers when lying on a reactive, air-filled surface compared with:
- foam surfaces (four studies, 229 people); and
- an active, air-filled surface (one study, 308 people in a nursing home, followed for 14 days).
It is unclear whether reactive, air-filled surfaces prevent ulcers more than other types of reactive surfaces.
Other effects
The studies did not provide sufficiently robust and clear evidence for us to determine how reactive, air-filled surfaces affect comfort and unwanted effects. No studies reported information about quality of life and cost. Most studies were small (83 people on average). Seven studies used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. It was unclear whether the other 10 studies used robust methods. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019.
If double-fortified salt is better than salt fortified with iodine alone for improving measures of iron and iodine-related nutrition, in particular:
- haemoglobin concentration;
- urinary iodine concentration;
- blood pressure;
- ferritin concentration;
- transferrin receptor concentration;
- prevalence of anaemia;
- prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia. We looked for studies that provided double-fortified salt to one group of participants and iodised salt to another. We compared their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sample size. We identified 18 studies, involving over 8800 individuals from five countries; 13 studies were conducted in India. In 13 studies the intervention lasted between 6 and 12 months; in two studies it lasted 3 months, and in single studies it lasted for 18 months, 24 months, or the duration was unclear. Nine studies were conducted in children and adolescents (5 to 17 years), four in adults (18 years and older), and five included multiple age groups. All studies compared double-fortified salt to iodised salt. Most studies were funded by non-profit organisations, university grants or academic institutes. In four studies, double-fortified salt was provided by a commercial organisation, and in three studies the funding source unclear.
Compared to iodised salt, double-fortified salt may improve haemoglobin concentration and body iron stores slightly, and probably reduces the prevalence of anaemia by 21%. However, double-fortified salt may also reduce urinary iodine concentration compared to iodised salt and may make little or no difference in ferritin and transferrin receptor concentration. Double-fortified salt may reduce the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia by 65%, compared to iodised salt, although this conclusion is uncertain because of some problems with the way the studies were conducted. Very few studies measured zinc protoporphyrin concentration, adverse effects, prevalence of goitre and salt intake. One study measured serum iron concentration.
No studies measured blood pressure or hepcidin concentration. We have relatively low confidence in the evidence for the outcomes: haemoglobin, urinary iodine, ferritin, and transferrin receptor concentration, and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia. Not all studies provided data about all outcomes of interest; studies delivered the intervention differently; and studies were small, both in number and size.
For the prevalence of anaemia, we are moderately confident in the evidence because studies used different ways of delivering the intervention.
Care should be taken in interpreting our findings in relation to public health policy and programmes. Most studies were conducted in monitored research settings and double-fortified salt was provided without an added cost. We are unsure if the effect we observed would be the same in real-life (i.e. non-research population), where purchasing double-fortified salt could increase the cost. More studies looking at the effect of double-fortified salt within real-life settings are needed to understand the true effects of double-fortified salt with greater certainty. Given the changing guidelines for salt intake, future studies should measure salt intake to understand if double-fortified salt should be considered to prevent anaemia at the population level and how to integrate double-fortified salt into the supply chain. The evidence is up to date to April 2021.
Four studies enrolled 2844 term infants and randomly allocated them to intubation to clear the airways or routine resuscitation without intubation. No benefit was found from routine intubation compared to routine resuscitation for vigorous term babies. The outcomes reported included: meconium aspiration syndrome, lung air leaks, need for oxygen, noisy breathing (stridor) and fits but there were no significant differences between the two groups. Routine endotracheal intubation of vigorous term babies born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid cannot be recommended. For non-vigorous babies endotracheal intubation is probably indicated until more information becomes available.
The evidence is current to August 2014. We included 12 studies (430 participants). People of all ages were included in the studies, which were conducted in high-income countries. Eleven studies (389 participants) compared injecting antibodies into the muscle or vein of participants to injecting salt water or giving no treatment. The study participants did not have their own antibodies. They had been in contact with rubella between one and 28 days prior to receiving the antibodies. The antibodies seemed to be effective at preventing participants from catching rubella, with those receiving antibodies 39% less likely to develop rubella than those not given antibodies. In an analysis of the seven studies (89 participants) where participants had been in contact with rubella only up to five days earlier, people given the highest doses used in the studies were 80% less likely to develop rubella than those not given antibodies. The studies assessing the prevention of rubella were of moderate quality because of some methodological issues and the fairly small number of participants. It is important to consider that the amount of rubella antibodies in today's blood donations may differ from those used in the studies. Therefore, doses given today may need to vary from those of the studies in order to obtain the same effect.
Only one study included pregnant women. All of the women were given one of two different doses of antibodies. They did not measure whether the babies born to the women were infected with rubella, but did consider whether birth defects that may be related to rubella were present. Key details about the study methods were missing and unobtainable, so the quality of this study was unclear. None of the babies born to these women were identified as having birth defects related to rubella. However, we cannot draw direct conclusions from this single study about the effectiveness of injecting antibodies after contact with rubella for preventing rubella-related birth defects in pregnant women. This is an area that needs further research.
The included studies did not report adverse events. Future studies should report this outcome.
This Cochrane Review is current to August 2020. We included four trials (803 randomised participants) in this updated review, including two new trials. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants), low-dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (fake medicine) (59 participants); one trial compared high-dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low-dose colchicine with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low-dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti-gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We selected low-dose colchicine compared with placebo as the primary comparison; the low dose is consistent with doses used in practice. Trials were performed in hospital and multicentre settings in four countries, the majority of participants were male, and mean age ranged between 51.2 and 70 years. One trial received funding from a pharmaceutical company that was involved in the study design, data collection, data analysis, and manuscript writing. Compared with placebo medication, low-dose colchicine for people with acute gout may slightly improve treatment outcomes with little or no increased risk of adverse events at 32 to 36 hours.
Proportion of participants reporting treatment success (defined as 50% or more reduction in pain)
25% more people (7% more to 42% more) reported success, or 25 more out of 100
- 42 people out of 100 reported treatment success with colchicine
- 17 people out of 100 reported treatment success with placebo
Total adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea)
6% more people reported adverse events (13% more to 23% more), or 6 more out of 100
- 26 people out of 100 reported side effects with colchicine
- 20 people out of 100 reported side effects with placebo
Pain, reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported for this comparison.
Other comparisons are briefly summarised here:
High-dose colchicine may improve symptoms compared with placebo, but with more adverse events. High-dose may have little or no benefit over low-dose colchicine but more adverse events. There may also be little or no benefit of low-dose colchicine over NSAIDs in terms of treatment success and pain reduction, with a similar number of adverse events.
There were no trials that compared colchicine to glucocorticoids. We found low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine may be an effective treatment for acute gout when compared to placebo and low-quality evidence that its benefits may be similar to NSAIDs. We downgraded the evidence for bias and imprecision. While both high- and low-dose colchicine improve treatment success when compared to placebo, high-dose (but not low-dose) colchicine may increase the number of adverse events compared to placebo while the number of adverse events may be similar with low-dose colchicine compared with NSAIDs.
Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
We found seven randomised clinical trials and one quasi-randomised trial suitable for this review, involving a total of 486 patients. When we put all the results together we could not show that using NIPPV was any better than not using it at preventing complications such as death, breathing problems, the need for extra breathing tubes or the length of stay in intensive care unit or in hospital. However, we thought the studies had problems with their methods and that the quality of evidence was either 'very low' or 'moderate'.
We identified 45 trials (involving 1619 participants) up to January 2018 and included them in our review. Twenty-four different electromechanical devices were described in the trials, which compared electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training with a variety of other interventions. Participants were between 21 to 80 years of age, the duration of the trials ranged from two to 12 weeks, the size of the trials was between eight and 127 participants, and the primary outcome (activities of daily living: the most important target variable measured) differed between the included trials. Electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training improved activities of daily living in people after stroke, and function and muscle strength of the affected arm. As adverse events, such as injuries and pain, were seldom described, these devices can be applied as a rehabilitation tool, but we still do not know when or how often they should be used. The quality of the evidence was high.
We searched for studies in women with PCOS that compared metformin alone or with CC, letrozole or LOD, against CC, letrozole, LOD, placebo (sham treatment) or no treatment. This review updates the previous version of the review. We included 41 randomised controlled trials (where women were randomly allocated to a treatment) with 4552 women. 13 studies are new for this update. We combined results from the studies and assessed the quality of the studies to judge how confident we could be in their results. The evidence is current up to December 2018.  Metformin may increase the chances of having a live birth compared with no treatment or placebo, however women taking metformin probably experience more gastrointestinal side effects. With placebo, the live birth rate is 19%, and it would be between 19% and 37% with metformin. The risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% with placebo, but higher with metformin, between 22% and 40%. Women taking metformin are probably more likely to get pregnant and may be more likely to ovulate. We are uncertain about the effect of metformin compared to placebo or no treatment on miscarriage. We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rate compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common. The live birth rate with CC alone is 24% which may change to between 23% to 34% with metformin and CC combined. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with metformin and CC combined. However, pregnancy rate is probably improved with metformin and CC. Ovulation rates may be improved with metformin and CC. There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage. We combined all the studies and found that the quality of evidence was very low, results were inconsistent, and we could not confidently draw conclusions. Obese women had a lower birth rate with metformin, while non-obese women showed a possible benefit from metformin. The live birth rate of non-obese women with CC is 26%, which may increase to between 26% and 50% with metformin. However, in obese women, the live birth rate is 22% which may decrease to between 5% to 13% with metformin. Similarly, among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy and ovulation while, non-obese women taking metformin may have more pregnancies; there was no clear difference in ovulation rates. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between women taking metformin or CC. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects.
It is possible that a woman's body mass index (a measure of healthy weight based on height and weight) affects which treatment she should take, although further research is required to establish this. The limited improvement in outcomes such as diabetes with metformin highlights the importance of weight loss and lifestyle adjustment, particularly in overweight women with PCOS. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main problems were that the studies’ methods were poor or unclear, or they did not report all their results (risk of bias), or they were inaccurate and inconsistent.
The authors of this review sought to identify every study where people with an abdominal injury were randomised to surgery or observation. The authors searched a variety of medical databases but only identified 2 studies, involving 51 and 63 people respectively, both of which took place in Finland and were conducted by the same researchers. Both studies included people with penetrating abdominal injuries, from having been stabbed. The review authors considered both studies to be at moderate risk of bias, since only part of the randomisation process was described and the study protocols were not available to enable full assessment of overall quality.
In one study (1992-1994) people received either an observation protocol or mandatory surgery. None of the people in the study died, and there was no difference in the number of people with medical complications between the study groups. One of the harms mentioned by the study authors was that surgery was performed on some people who did not actually need it. Unnecessary surgery can subject people to potential complications.
In the other study (1997-2002) people received an observation protocol or diagnostic laparoscopy (minimal surgery). No one died in either group, and there were no differences between the groups in the number of surgeries needed. There were no unnecessary surgeries in either group.
Based on the findings of these two small studies, there is no evidence to support the use of surgical management over an observation protocol for people with abdominal trauma showing no signs of bleeding or infection.
The authors recommend that future randomised controlled studies clearly report the type of injury, number of damaged organs, extent of damage of internal organs, and complications in the people included.
We examined the findings of trials that randomised people to receive either LAMA+LABA or LABA+ICS to see how they compare. We searched for trials that explored the benefits and harms of LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS for the treatment of people with COPD. We summarised these results and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 19 studies involving 22,354 participants. The studies lasted from 6 to 52 weeks. The studies included more men than women (approximately 70% of participants were men), and the people in the studies were about 64 years old. Most studies included people with moderate to severe COPD. Pharmaceutical companies were involved in most of the studies, which might affect how much we can trust the results.
Compared to LABA+ICS, LAMA+LABA led to an improvement in lung function, reduced pneumonia from 5% to 3% but increased the risk of death from 1% to 1.4%. LAMA+LABA probably made little to no difference to COPD exacerbations (flare-ups) compared to LABA+ICS. People in each of the treatment groups reported similar quality of life scores and were about as likely to experience serious side effects, which were rare. Our confidence in the evidence was moderate to high because the included studies were well-designed and had a sufficient number of participants with mainly moderate to severe COPD. This review is up to date to 10 September 2022. The results from future or ongoing trials evaluating newly developed medicines are awaited. This review should be updated again in a few years.
Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmic disease where the heart beats rapidly and irregularly. This can occur for separate brief or long episodes (paroxysmal) or it may become continuous (persistent). This review's aim was to establish whether catheter ablation was better than medical therapies to control heart rate or rhythm for paroxysmal and persistent AF. If catheter ablations were found to be better, the aim was to determine which ablation method was superior to the other. In catheter ablation, a thin tube is passed through a vein to the heart through which instruments can target the misfiring parts of the tissue that control the hearts rhythm. A total of thirty two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review. Catheter ablation may be superior to medical treatment but the data is inconclusive in inhibiting recurrence of AF. Embolic complications were commonly caused by catheter ablation. Although these complications and death rate of catheter ablation were similar to that of medical therapies, catheter ablation may cause adverse events of radiation exploration. We were also unable to determine which catheter ablation technique was the best as most RCTs were small scale. Evidence from RCTs cannot yet support catheter ablation as the first line of treatment for paroxysmal and persistent AF.
We searched electronic databases for studies that investigated printed self-help. We ran our most recent search in March 2018, and so far we have found 75 studies. Most studies took place in North America or Europe and were carried out with adults, although they did not require that people wanted to quit smoking to join. Studies delivered self-help materials in person or by post, some all at once, and some spread out over the length of the study. In most studies, self-help was the only support people were given, but some studies tested self-help given with other kinds of support to test whether there was any extra benefit from written self-help. Some studies gathered information about individual smokers, so they could tailor self-help to better help them. Eleven studies including over 13,000 people provided evidence of a small benefit of printed self-help materials when provided on their own. Our confidence in this evidence was only moderate, because these studies took place in high-income countries, which makes them less relevant to people from lower-income countries, who might benefit differently. When people used self-help as well as receiving face-to-face advice on how to stop smoking (11 studies), there was no extra benefit compared with the effect of that advice without printed self-help.
Thirty-two studies provided written self-help that was individually tailored, comparing it with either non-tailored self-help or nothing. Evidence based on ten studies including nearly 15,000 people showed that tailored self-help was more helpful than nothing. Our confidence in this evidence is moderate, because some of these studies might have had problems in the ways they were carried out that could have affected the results. When no other support is available, written self-help materials help more people to stop smoking compared with getting no help at all. People were more likely to make successful quit attempts when they were also given face-to-face support or nicotine replacement therapy, but printed self-help did not make these people more likely to quit.
Self-help materials that were tailored to help individual people are more effective than no help at all. However, tailoring these materials often involves more contact with the research team, and when we compared tailored self-help with regular self-help that involved the same amount of contact, we did not find a difference in quit rates.
The studies we found looked at self-help given to people in high-income countries, where more intensive support is often available. More research is needed to find out how well self-help works for people in low- and middle-income countries, where more intensive support is less available.
However, the review of trials found little evidence to show that silver acetate helps smokers quit. Any beneficial effect of silver acetate is likely to be very small, and less than the effect already proven for nicotine replacement therapy.
The review of trials found that medical methods for abortion in early pregnancy can be safe and effective, with the most evidence of effectiveness for a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol (a prostaglandin). Almost all of the trials were done in well-resourced hospitals where women returned for check-up.
Seventeen trials were included. These involved 1433 patients, who were mostly young physically active adults. All included trials had methodological weaknesses that are likely to undermine the reliability of their results. Data for pooling individual outcomes were available for a maximum of nine trials.
There was not enough evidence of differences between two groups in terms of functional knee scores, adverse effects and complications (infection, hardware problem such as pain from fixation device, graft failure), range of motion (flexion and extension deficit). At long term follow-up, some clinician-assessed measures of knee stability and repeated rupture rate or occurrence of new meniscal injuries were better after double-bundle reconstruction.
We concluded that there was not enough evidence to say whether double-bundle reconstruction gives better results than single-bundle reconstruction for anterior cruciate ligament rupture in adults. However, there is limited evidence that double-bundle ACL reconstruction has some superior results for knee stability and protection against repeat ACL rupture or newly occurring meniscal injury.
Our most recent search date was 24 February 2020. We included 21 studies, with 762 participants (60% men and 40% women), and a mean age ranging from 50 to 78 years. The participants included in the studies were at different time points after stroke, and the etiology (causes of stroke) was also varied. All participants were able to walk with some difficulty. All included studies compared MI training with another intervention, and physical practice was the most applied therapy in the comparison (control) groups. In the experimental groups, most of the included studies used MI combined with physical practice, and used either kinesthetic (when someone imagines himself or herself) or visual (when the individual observes another person) MI. The treatment time for the experimental groups ranged from two to eight weeks. In general, only three of the included studies conducted a follow-up assessment after interventions. We found very low-certainty evidence that MI alone or combined with either action observation (a type of imagery in which patients observe movement) or physical practice was superior to other therapies in improving walking speed in a short-term period. However, there is very low-certainty evidence that MI was no more beneficial than other therapies for improving motor function and functional mobility at the end of the treatment. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of MI on independence to perform activities of daily living and walking endurance after stroke, and to evaluate the medium- or long-term effects of MI on all assessed outcomes. Although poorly reported, no adverse events related to MI and other therapies were observed. It is unknown whether the gait of people who have had a stroke could benefit from MI training compared to placebo or no intervention. We classified the certainty of the evidence as very low because many studies had methodological concerns and low numbers of participants, and did not follow guidelines for how studies should be reported.
The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive-aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis.
Although meditation therapy is widely used in many anxiety-related conditions there is still a lack of studies in anxiety disorder patients. The small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. Transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation. Drop out rates appear to be high, and adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.
This review was conducted to find out if combining doxorubicin with other drugs is more effective than doxorubicin alone. Eight studies were considered together, which showed if combination chemotherapy is given: (1) tumour shrinkage was marginally better than in patients treated with doxorubicin alone; (2) survival was no different; and (3) side effects were worse than for patients treated with doxorubicin alone
This review aims to compare sertindole to the other newer second generation (atypical) antipsychotics in people who have schizophrenia. Two studies were identified which included 508 people. Both compared sertindole to risperidone, were short (12 weeks) and the participants were either at least moderately ill or treatment resistant. There was no overall significant difference between these two medications in terms of improvement in people’s general well-being or their mental state. Also while people on risperidone showed more movement side-effects, those on sertindole were more likely to put on weight, have changes in their heart rhythm and the men were more likely to suffer from sexual dysfunction.
The data from these trials are limited and a considerable number of the participants left the study early. In addition, sertindole has only been compared to one second generation antipsychotic and the trials are relatively short. A larger and longer trial comparing sertindole to other second generation antipsychotics, with the outcomes including mental state, general functioning, adverse effects and quality of life, would enhance our knowledge in this area considerably.

If CbMs relieved cancer pain in people living with cancer.
If CbMs were associated with any unwanted or harmful effects. We searched for clinical trials that examined CbMs compared to other medications to treat cancer pain in adults.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the methods and size of studies. We found 14 studies involving 1823 people. The biggest study included 399 people and the smallest study included 10 people.
Studies were conducted in countries around the world; most (six) were based in North America.
Five studies used one dose of CbM and lasted less than one day. Other studies lasted between two and eight weeks.
Pharmaceutical companies funded seven studies.
Six studies compared a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Seven studies compared an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC against placebo. Of these seven studies, two studies compared against a morphine-like medication (codeine), too. One study compared CBD against placebo.
We did not find studies with herbal cannabis. Mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD was probably not better than placebo in reducing pain in people with moderate-to-severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment. Thirty-two out of 100 people reported to be much or very much improved by cannabis-based mouth spray and 23 out of 100 people with mouth spray with placebo. A total of 19 out of 100 people withdrew early because of side effects by cannabis-based mouth spray and 16 out of 100 people by mouth spray with placebo. There was no difference in serious side effects between the cannabis-based mouth spray and a placebo mouth spray.
Artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may not be better than a fake medication in reducing pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy in people with head and neck cancer and a certain type of lung cancer.
A single dose of an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC may be better than a single dose of placebo, but may not differ from a single small dose of a morphine-like medication in reducing moderate-to-severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours.
CBD may not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain in people with advanced cancer.
We found no studies with medical cannabis. We are moderately confident in the evidence that a mouth spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD does not reduce severe cancer pain despite opioid treatment because studies did not provide information about everything that we could have used.
We have little confidence in the evidence that an artificial cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC (nabilone) does not reduce pain associated with chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that artificial cannabinoids mimicking the effects of THC reduce cancer pain after the previous pain-relieving medication was stopped some hours before because the studies did not provide data about everything that we could have used, and because the studies were small.
We have little confidence in the evidence that CBD added to standard palliative care does not reduce cancer pain because there was only one study available. The evidence is up to date to January 2023.
We searched for evidence on 12 January 2016 and found five randomised studies, involving 1819 women. Two of the studies were large, high-quality studies, in women with gestational hypertension, mild pre-eclampsia or deteriorating existing hypertension at 34 to 37 weeks (704 women) or with gestational hypertension or mild pre-eclampsia at 36 to 41 weeks (756 women). Fewer women who received planned early delivery experienced severe adverse outcomes (1459 women, high-quality evidence ). There was not enough information to draw any conclusions about the effects on the number of babies born with poor health, with a high level of variability between the two studies (1459 infants, low-quality evidence ). There was no clear difference between planned early delivery and delayed delivery for the number of caesarean sections (four studies, 1728 women, moderate-quality evidence ), or the duration of the mother’s hospital stay after the birth of the baby (two studies, 925 women, moderate-quality evidence ) (or for the baby (one study, 756 infants, moderate-quality evidence)). More babies who were delivered early had breathing problems (respiratory distress syndrome, three studies, 1511 infants), or were admitted to the neonatal unit (four studies, 1585 infants). Fewer women who delivered early developed HELLP syndrome (three studies, 1628 women) or severe kidney problems (one study, 100 women).
Two studies compared women who had labour induced at 34 to 36 weeks and at 34 to 37 weeks with a comparison group who were monitored until 37 weeks, when induction was begun if labour had not started spontaneously. Three studies compared induction of labour at term or closer to term, at 37 completed weeks and at 36 to 41 weeks, with women who were monitored until 41 weeks when induction was begun if labour had not started spontaneously. Other inclusion and exclusion criteria also differed between the five studies.
No studies attempted to blind the women or their clinicians to which group they were in. Women and staff were aware of the intervention and this may have affected aspects of care and decision-making. Most of the evidence was of moderate quality, so we can be moderately certain about the findings. Overall, if a woman’s baby was delivered immediately after 34 weeks, there was less risk of a complication for the mother and no clear difference in the overall rate of complications for the baby, but information was limited.
These findings are applicable to general obstetric practice when high blood pressure disorders during pregnancy are considered together. Further studies are needed to look at the different types of hypertensive disorders individually.
We identified 10 relevant studies involving data from 944 adults, all male. Few of these studies provided information about the primary outcome of this review, which was reoffending. This was usually because studies did not collect data for a sufficiently long period outside prison or the treatment setting. Many studies relied on other outcome measures (for example, anger or social skills) chosen by investigators in the hope that they were linked in some way with future offending, although it cannot be stated with certainty that such connections reliably predict reoffending.
Five of the trials we found involved 664 men and used primarily cognitive behavioural interventions (CBT). In the largest study, which had the most complex and intense 'package' of treatment both within and outside of prison, there was no difference between the group who had received CBT and those who had not in terms of the risk of reoffending as measured by reconviction for sexual offences.
One study, involving 231 men, compared psychodynamic intervention with standard care, which was probation, and suggested that probation was mildly superior in terms of reducing reoffending.
Behavioural programmes were looked at in four trials involving 70 men. For two studies, not enough data were reported to assess the effectiveness of treatment. For the remaining two, encouraging results with regards to reconvictions and self-reported urges have to be treated with caution as the studies are relatively old, meaning that many participants would not now seek or be offered treatment, as some of the targeted behaviours have been decriminalised.
Data for adverse events, 'sexually anomalous urges' and for secondary outcomes thought to be 'dynamic' risk factors for reoffending, including anger and cognitive distortions, were limited.
We concluded that further randomised controlled trials are urgently needed in this area, so that society is not lured into a false sense of security in the belief that once the individual has been treated, then their risk of reoffending is reduced. Currently, the evidence does not support this belief.
Review authors working with Cochrane Oral Health searched for studies up to 16 January 2019. We identified 35 studies (3929 adult participants). Participants knew that they were in an experiment, which might have affected their teeth cleaning or eating behaviour. Some studies had other problems that might make their findings less reliable, such as people dropping out of the study or not using the assigned device.
Studies evaluated the following devices plus toothbrushing compared to toothbrushing only: floss (15 studies), interdental brushes (2 studies), wooden cleaning sticks (2 studies), rubber/elastomeric cleaning sticks (2 studies) and oral irrigators (5 studies). Four devices were compared with floss: interdental brushes (9 studies), wooden cleaning sticks (3 studies), rubber/elastomeric cleaning sticks (9 studies), oral irrigators (2 studies). Three studies compared rubber/elastomeric cleaning sticks with interdental brushes.
No studies evaluated decay, and few evaluated severe gum disease. Outcomes were measured at short (one month to six weeks) and medium term (three and six months). We found that using floss, in addition to toothbrushing, may reduce gingivitis in the short and medium term. It is unclear if it reduces plaque.
Using an interdental brush, in addition to a toothbrush, may reduce gingivitis and plaque in the short term.
Using wooden tooth cleaning sticks may be better than toothbrushing only for reducing gingivitis (measured by bleeding sites) but not plaque in the medium term (only 24 participants).
Using a tooth cleaning stick made of rubber or an elastomer may be better than toothbrushing only for reducing plaque but not gingivitis in the short term (only 30 participants).
Toothbrushing plus oral irrigation (water pressure) may reduce gingivitis in the short term, but there was no evidence for this in the medium term. There was no evidence of a difference in plaque.
Interdental brushes may be better than flossing for gingivitis at one and three months. The evidence for plaque is inconsistent. There was no evidence of a difference between the devices for periodontitis measured by probing pocket depth.
There is some evidence that oral irrigation may be better than flossing for reducing gingivitis (but not plaque) in the short term.
The available evidence for interdental cleaning sticks did not show them to be better or worse than floss or interdental brushes for controlling gingivitis or plaque.
The studies that measured 'adverse events' found no serious effects and no evidence of differences between study groups in minor effects such as gum irritation. The evidence is low to very low-certainty. The effects observed may not be clinically important. Studies measured outcomes mostly in the short term and many participants had a low level of gum disease at the beginning of the studies. Future studies should use the new periodontal diseases classification to describe the gum health of participants, and they should last long enough to measure periodontitis and tooth decay.
We sought to review all randomised trials that used glutamatergic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia. This review shows that substances acting on the glutamate system may improve symptoms when added to regular antipsychotic medication, although the available evidence base is too limited to allow for any firm conclusions. Presently, glutamatergic drugs are not available for clinical use. Additional research is needed to determine their ultimate role in the treatment of schizophrenia.
We included 16 studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed). This review found that long-term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic infections but the benefit is probably small and must be weighed against the likelihood that future infections are likely to be caused by bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic given. Long-term, low dose antibiotics to prevent repeat UTI should be reserved for those children at high risk of repeat infection, such as young infants, and children clinicians would strongly want to reduce the risk of further infections, such as children with renal abnormalities.
This review examined the studies to date to see what effect psychological treatments had on women with metastatic breast cancer. We found 10 studies with a total of 1378 women with metastatic breast cancer. Three of the studies used a psychological treatment known as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), four studies used supportive-expressive group therapy (SEGT), while the remaining three studies used treatments that were delivered on an individual basis and were neither CBT nor SEGT.
We performed statistical analysis and found that the odds ratio (a measure of association between an intervention and an outcome) for survival of women with metastatic breast cancer one year after receiving psychological treatment was 1.46, suggesting that there was an association between the psychological treatment and improved survival. This finding was not found when looking at the odds ratio of survival at five years. We also found some evidence that psychological treatments in the short term (for example, one year) may produce a small reduction in pain and improve some psychological symptoms. However, making comparisons across these studies was difficult as they differed in their conduct, treatments and measures used. Moreover, we cannot rule out that the psychological treatments could also cause psychological harm.
It was hard from the available evidence to draw any conclusions about whether washing blood would be helpful or not for preterm babies. As of now, there is no strong evidence showing that washing blood makes any difference to the outcomes of preterm babies.
Treatment options for heart failure range from drugs to heart transplantation, with each having its own limitations. Coenzyme Q10 (or ubiquinone) has been suggested as a treatment option in some trials. Coenzyme Q10 is a non-prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat-soluble molecule that has a role in energy production within the cells of the body. It may also have antioxidant properties.
Low levels of coenzyme Q10 may be related to the severity of heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 has been found in all tissues and organs in the body, with the highest concentrations in the heart. Emerging data have suggested that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (unstable molecules that contains oxygen and easily reacts with other molecules) are increased in people with heart failure. Because of its antioxidant activity, coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects, which damage the components of the cardiac cells, and disrupt cellular signalling. Coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in conducting signals within the heart muscle and in generating energy.The concentration of coenzyme Q10 has been inversely related to the severity of heart failure. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 may improve heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 is sometimes used because it is thought to have an acceptable safety profile, with no significant side effects.
We conducted this review to assess the available evidence on the effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. We included 11 randomised controlled trials, involving 1573 participants. They were relatively small, and followed up participants for a relatively short period of time. The analyses show that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of mortality from all causes, and hospitalisations due to heart failure. It may result in increased, or little or no difference in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or adverse events. The effect of coenzyme Q10 on cardiac function and symptom improvement is uncertain.
The evidence, current to October 2020, is of a moderate quality at best, because of the high risk of bias in some of the included studies and the absence of precise and consistent results. There is currently no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure.
Duxil is described as having several properties which may be beneficial for dementia. This review looked for randomized trials comparing Duxil with control in patients with dementia. Three trials were identified. Though there was significant beneficial effect of Duxil on the improvement of cognitive function, due to the low methodological quality of included trials, small number of trials and probable publication bias, this review did not provide sufficient evidence to support the routine use of Duxil for the treatment of patients with dementia. More large, high-quality randomized trials are needed.
We wanted to determine whether there is evidence to favour bubble systems versus ventilator or Infant Flow Driver systems for reducing the rate of CPAP treatment failure (the baby's condition worsening or the baby needing mechanical ventilation) and reducing complications and harms. We searched medical databases for randomised controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) up to January 2023. We included 15 trials that compared the use of bubble CPAP versus ventilator or Infant Flow Driver CPAP in a total of 1437 preterm babies. Trials were mostly small, and had design flaws that could put their findings at risk of bias. Combined analyses showed that using bubble CPAP rather than ventilator or Infant Flow Driver CPAP may reduce the risk of CPAP treatment failure, but that bubble CPAP may not affect the risk of death or other complications of prematurity. Bubble CPAP likely increases the risk of moderate-severe nasal injury. None of the included studies looked at effects on disability or other developmental outcomes. We judged the certainty of the evidence for the effects of bubble versus ventilators or Infant Flow Driver for CPAP in preterm babies to be low because of concerns that the methods used in the included trials may have introduced biases, and the limited amount of data from the trials (meaning the results are less precise). Our confidence in the results is therefore limited.
There are beds, mattresses and mattress toppers specifically designed for people with pressure ulcers. These can be made from a range of materials (such as foam, air cells or water bags) and are divided into two groups:
- reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin, unless a person moves or is repositioned; and
- active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body.
We wanted to find out if reactive and active surfaces:
- help ulcers to heal;
- are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
- have health benefits that outweigh their costs; and
- have any unwanted effects. We searched the medical literature for studies that evaluated the effects of beds, mattresses and mattress toppers. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 13 studies (972 people, average age: 83 years) that lasted between seven days and 18 months (average: 37.5 days).
In general, the studies did not provide sufficiently robust evidence for us to determine the effects of active and reactive surfaces.
Evidence from two studies suggests that, when compared with mattresses and mattress toppers made of foam, beds with a reactive air-filled surface may:
- improve chances of pressure ulcers healing if the data on the time needed to completely heal an ulcer is looked at (1 study, 84 people);
- cost an extra 26 US dollars per person for every ulcer-free day in the first year of use (1 study, 87 people).
The other benefits and risks of these and other surfaces are unclear. Most studies were small (72 people on average) and nearly half of them (six studies) used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019.
This review found a large clinical trial that examined the effectiveness of pemetrexed disodium, an anticancer drug developed to treat pleural mesothelioma, given in combination with another cancer drug, cisplatin. The results indicate that pemetrexed used in combination with cisplatin significantly increases the length of survival, when compared with cisplatin alone. Further research is needed into the optimum treatment regimen for pleural mesothelioma.
This review looks at vaccines targeted at the 'pre-erythrocytic' phase of the parasite's life, the phase before the parasites first enter the bloodstream from the liver. Trials of four types of vaccine against P. falciparum, the most important human malaria species, were available for this review. One of these (the RTS,S vaccine) significantly reduced the number of episodes of clinical malaria and severe malaria in children, while the other three vaccines were not effective under the conditions of the trials. No severe adverse events observed following the RTS,S vaccination were judged to be related to vaccination, though minor adverse events like headache, swelling, and malaise were.
It is important to identify patients, presenting at a doctor's appointment at an outpatient service or at the emergency department who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease or dying. It can help clinicians in deciding if the patients need hospitalisation. We wanted to know if routine laboratory tests were sufficiently accurate to predict mortality and deterioration in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. We searched for studies that assessed how well routine laboratory tests predict mortality and deterioration in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. We included studies of any design and set anywhere in the world. Patients of any age or sex were included. We found 64 studies that looked at 53 different routine laboratory tests. These studies assessed how well these tests could predict mortality, deterioration, or both. A total of 71,170 patients were included, of which 8169 (11.5%) patients died, and 4031 (5.7%) patients deteriorated to severe/critical disease. Adult patients were included in 31 studies, two studies reported on patients more than 60 years, two studies included a mix of children and adults, and one study included only children. Most studies were done in China, followed by Spain and Italy. All studies took place in hospitals.
'Sensitivity' and 'specificity' are often used to report the performance of tests. Sensitivity is the proportion of patients with the outcome (= mortality or deterioration) that are correctly detected by the test, and specificity is the proportion of people without the outcome that are correctly detected by the test. The closer the sensitivity and specificity of a test are to 100%, the more accurate the test is. To safely rule out patients who will not die or deteriorate, a high sensitivity of more than 90% is necessary. When four or more studies assessed the same tests, we pooled the data and analysed them together. We did not find any tests that were accurate enough to safely rule out a severe outcome, such as deterioration or death. We found five tests with both sensitivity and specificity exceeding 50%. Four of these laboratory tests indicate important inflammation in a SARS-CoV-2 infection. These four tests are C-reactive protein, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase. The fifth test, d-dimer, reflects a state of increased blood clotting in a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have low confidence in the evidence of this review, because there were important differences between the included studies, and it was, therefore, difficult to compare them. Sensitivity and specificity depend on where the cut-off point is made between positive (indicative of disease) and negative (disease-free). For some studies, the authors decided on the cut-off value (for a test) before doing the test (less likely to create bias) and in others, they chose the cut-off value after analysis of the test (more likely to be biassed). Routine laboratory tests can be performed at a doctor's appointment or at the emergency department. However, the included studies only assessed patients presenting to the hospital. We included patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only one study reported on vaccinated patients, and we could not assess the effect of different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Therefore, our results might not be representative for vaccinated patients or different variants of concern. These routine laboratory tests, linked to inflammation and blood clotting in patients with COVID-19 disease, can be used for risk stratification to assess a patient. However, none of these tests performed well enough to safely rule out progression to severe or deadly disease. These tests might serve to assess the overall health status of the patient. To predict deterioration or mortality, a more comprehensive assessment, including clinical symptoms, radiological findings and patient's characteristics, may be considered. We searched for all COVID-19 studies up to 25 August 2022.
This review found no randomised controlled trial that had investigated the role of thalidomide or a similar drug lenalidomide, for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. There is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of these agents as maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease. However, given the well known risk of severe birth defects the use of thalidomide is not recommended. Lenalidomide has a much lower risk of causing birth defects and well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness and side effects of this drug for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. The use of lenalidomide is not recommended until data from a well designed study are available to support its use.
The review included two studies and approximately 125 women. One study compared two different antibiotics, and there were no differences between the two antibiotics for symptom relief. A second study comparing no treatment, breast emptying, and antibiotic therapy, with breast emptying suggested more rapid symptom relief with antibiotics. There is very little evidence on the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy, and more research is needed.
After reviewing the studies and their available data, we could not be certain that one approach had superiority over another, and we could not establish whether the two treatments had similar effects on outcomes. We found no adverse effects associated with either treatment. Currently, no definitive evidence allows us to conclude that chest compressions should be the initial therapy for patients with OHCA over immediate electric shock treatment. However, we believe that the amount and quality of research in this area currently are not sufficient to allow strong conclusions. To further our understanding of the efficacy of these two different strategies, further rigorous randomized controlled trials are required.
Eleven studies on 419 people with asthma or exercise-induced breathlessness were included in this review comparing vitamin C compared to placebo (no vitamin C). Most studies were in adults and one small study was in children. The small number of studies available for review and their different designs meant that we were only able to describe individual studies, rather than pooling the results together to get an average from the trials. The study design was not well described in most study reports and therefore it was impossible to determine risk of bias for most of the studies. There was very little data available in the trials for our key outcomes and this may indicate some selective outcome reporting. There was no indication of benefit from the studies that considered vitamin C in relation to asthma. However, it is not possible to form any clear conclusions on the basis of those studies at this stage. The review concludes that there is insufficient evidence currently available to evaluate the use of vitamin C as a treatment in asthma. Larger, well-designed research is needed to provide clearer guidance. There was some indication that vitamin C was helpful in exercise-induced breathlessness in terms of how easily people breathe and their symptoms; however, as these findings were provided by only very small studies they do not provide complete answers to guide treatment. Details of the way patients were allocated to receive vitamin C or not were not clearly described in 10 of the 11 studies and we considered this carefully in the review in relation to our level of uncertainty in interpreting the results. Taking this into account, together with the imprecision of the results, we judged the estimates of the usefulness of vitamin C as a treatment to be of either low or moderate quality in relation to asthma.
Additionally, for exercise-induced breathlessness the three studies providing data to the review were small and we are mindful of the need to draw very cautious conclusions about the results.
This plain language summary is current as of December 2012.
There have been a number of randomised controlled trials of piracetam given to patients within 48 hours of the onset of their stroke. Data from three trials, involving 1002 patients, were available for this review, but almost all came from a single study. The data reviewed did not provide conclusive evidence about the effects of piracetam for acute stroke. One additional, large study has been conducted and interrupted by the manufacturer after some preliminary analyses were carried out, but the results have not been made available to the scientific community.
We included eight studies, identified up to October 2013, evaluating the effect of DTIs versus warfarin in people with non-valvular AF. DTIs included were dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily (three studies, 12,355 participants), AZD0837 300 mg once a day (two studies, 233 participants) and ximelagatran 36 mg twice daily (three studies, 3726 participants). Of the total number of participants included in this review 61% were men, and the mean age of participants in all studies was over 70 years. Follow-up periods after the end of study medication ranged from zero to four weeks. We conducted the analyses excluding ximelagatran because this drug was withdrawn from the market owing to toxic effects on the liver. We evaluated the effectiveness of the treatment by the number of vascular deaths and ischaemic events. We evaluated safety by the number of (1) fatal and non-fatal major bleeding events, including haemorrhagic strokes, (2) adverse events other than bleeding and ischaemic events that led to treatment discontinuation, and (3) death from all causes.
There was no difference in the number of vascular deaths and ischaemic events between all DTIs combined and warfarin, although dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was superior to warfarin for this outcome. Major bleeding events were less frequent with the DTIs, making them a potentially safer alternative to anticoagulation in people at high risk. The adverse events that led participants to discontinue treatment were more frequent with the DTIs. Death from all causes was similar between DTIs and warfarin. We judged the quality of all eight included studies to be adequate to address the main objectives of the review.
We found 19 trials comparing IPV training to no training, training as usual, or other trainings that were included in this review, with 1662 participants who were practising or student/trainee doctors, nurses, midwives, dentists, social workers and psychologists/counsellors. Three-quarters of all studies were conducted in the USA, with single studies from Australia, Iran, Mexico, Turkey and the Netherlands. Most studies received some university or government financial support to complete the research.
Studies varied greatly in the kind of IPV training provided, in both content and delivery method. Studies differed in how they measured training outcomes and follow-up time points. Most IPV training included types and definitions of IPV, prevalence and risk factors, and sought to challenge common myths and misinformation. Clinical scenarios were frequently used as learning tools, outlining typical patient presentations, and skills training involved learning how to ask women about IPV, how to respond by validating their experiences, document accurately, discuss safety planning and refer women to support services. Compared to no training, placebo or wait-list, IPV training may have positive effects on HCPs' attitudes towards survivors of IPV. Training may improve their knowledge around, and readiness to respond to survivors of IPV, but the evidence is very uncertain. There is limited evidence that some types of IPV training can lead to improvements in identification, safety planning and documentation of IPV, but the findings are inconsistent, and most studies report little to no impact of training on these outcomes. Training may make little to no difference to referral practices. No studies with no training, placebo or wait-list in the comparison group, assessed IPV survivors' mental health outcomes. No adverse effects of IPV training were reported in any of these studies.
The studies that compared training of HCPs to training as usual or a sub-component of the training typically found no difference in HCPs' attitudes, safety planning, and referral to services or mental health outcomes for women. The evidence was inconsistent about provider readiness to respond, their actual response and changes in IPV knowledge.
Overall, the certainty of the evidence for the effectiveness of training HCPs in how to respond to IPV is low to very low. Future research should include higher-quality trials, with greater clarity of methods that objectively measure outcomes (actual rather than perceived), with an emphasis on behaviour change in HCPs, and the well-being of women survivors of IPV. The evidence is current to June 2020.
Twenty-seven trials with 1979 adult participants provided data for this review. This review update added 12 trials with 945 participants. The 1979 trial participants were randomly assigned to vitamin D compared with placebo (dummy pill) or no treatment. Eleven trials were conducted in high-income countries, and 16 trials in middle-income countries. The age range of the participants was 28 years to 61 years, and on average 44% were women. Ten trials included people with chronic hepatitis C, five trials people with liver cirrhosis, 11 trials people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and one trial liver transplant recipients. There were no trials including people with chronic hepatitis B or inherited liver diseases. All of the included trials reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants. Vitamin D administration lasted on average six months, and most trials used the cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) form. Fourteen trials appeared to be free of vested interest that could bias the trial results. Eleven trials may not have been free of vested interest, as they did not provide any information on clinical trial support or sponsorship. Two trials were funded by industry. We found no difference between trials without industry support compared to trials at risk of industry support in our analysis. There is not enough evidence to determine whether vitamin D has beneficial or harmful effects, or has little to no effect on chronic liver diseases in adults. There were too few participants in the individual trials as well as in our evidence synthesis. The trials were at high risk of bias so we lack fair assessments of the benefits and harms of vitamin D in this population. Neither benefits nor harms of vitamin D supplementation in people with chronic liver diseases can be excluded. There were no trials including people with chronic hepatitis B and inherited liver diseases. We judged all trials to be at high risk of bias (that is an underestimation or overestimation of the true intervention effect). The certainty of evidence is very low. The evidence is current to November 2020.
We found one small randomised trial (involving 36 women) that compared prostaglandin E2 intravaginal gel administered before caesarean section compared with a placebo gel. The information obtained from this study did not permit us to be certain that prostaglandins improve neonatal breathing following planned caesarean section at term. Only one baby in the placebo group had respiratory distress assessed as rapid breathing. Further studies have to be carried out in order to find out the impact of prostaglandins on the newborn lungs after caesarean section.
The certainty of the evidence provided by these studies is moderate. We downgraded the certainty of evidence from high to moderate due to the small size and number of studies and concerns over the methods used (risk of bias). Further larger studies are needed to determine the effects of different heparin doses.
We wanted to explore the views and experiences of consumers and health providers working in partnership to plan, deliver and evaluate health services. We also wanted to identify best practice principles for partnering in formal group formats. We conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) to understand the views and experiences of health providers and consumers working in partnership. A QES brings together and analyses the results from individual qualitative studies. Qualitative studies use data that are collected through interviews, focus groups, questionnaires and observations.
The QES was conducted with a Stakeholder Panel of consumers and health providers. The Panel worked with the research team to decide which questions to answer, what studies should be included, whether the analysis was comprehensive and to develop the best practice principles.
We searched databases for qualitative studies that explored consumers’ and health providers' views and experiences of partnering in formal group formats. We searched for studies published from January 2000 to October 2018. We also searched websites of organisations involved in person-centred care, and asked experts to share relevant studies.
From these searches we selected 33 studies for in-depth analysis. The studies were from different countries and settings (e.g. hospital or community clinics) and involved different people (including under-represented patients) and different types of formal group partnerships (e.g. committees or steering groups).
We combined the results of the studies and looked for common themes. These themes became our findings. We rated our confidence in each of the findings based on the relevance, quality and quantity of the data. We grouped the findings into categories. Our analysis identified 19 findings, which we grouped into the following five categories. government policy, processes, funding, and the organisational context of the health service influenced partnering. consumer recruitment occurred in various ways. In a few studies consumers managed the recruitment process. Some people (particularly health providers) felt consumers should reflect the range of people who used the health service. Some health providers thought that the experience of some consumers did not reflect the broader population. Consumers sometimes found it difficult to represent a broad range of community views. positive relationships between health providers and consumers improved  partnerships. Formal meetings and being unclear about the consumer role could limit consumers’ involvement. Health providers’ professional status, technical knowledge, and use of jargon could be intimidating for consumers. Consumers sometimes felt their knowledge was not valued. Consumers could become frustrated when they lacked decision-making power, and when health providers dominated the meeting agenda. formal partnerships could affect health providers and consumers in both positive and negative ways. people perceivedformal partnerships may improve health service culture and the physical environment of the health service. They also felt partnerships may improve health service design and delivery. Best practice principles for partnering in formal group formats were developed from the findings. Principles included leadership and health service culture; diversity; equity; mutual respect; shared vision and regular communication; shared agendas and decision-making; influence and sustainability. Most of the findings in this review are rated as "high" or "moderate" confidence, which means the evidence for the findings is strong. However, one finding that showed people perceived formal partnerships improved health service evaluation, was rated as "very low" confidence because it was based on weaker evidence. This evidence is up to date to October 2018. The review took longer than usual to complete because co-produced research takes time, and the review was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because most of the findings are rated "high" or "moderate" confidence, we believe an updated search may not substantially change the results.
Some studies have indicated that poor cerebral perfusion is related to unfavourable functional outcomes, precipitating strokes and other vascular events, which are often responsible for high mortality rates. External counterpulsation (ECP) is a non-invasive and acceptable method which is known to improve perfusion of the brain. It provides pressure to the calves, thighs and buttocks by means of air-filled cuffs. This helps to increase blood flow to the heart, brain and kidneys. This review identified two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ECP involving 160 participants with acute ischaemic stroke. There is no convincing evidence to support the routine use of ECP for the treatment of patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Further high-quality and large-scale RCTs are needed.
We found eight randomized controlled trials, of which five compared similar chemotherapy regimens in both trial arms, except for the anthracycline. Even among these five trials, three included more intense chemotherapy in the control arm. Most trials were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Only one of them included rituximab as part of the chemotherapy regimen. Almost all patients were treatment-naive with advanced disease. Follow-up ranged between three and five years in most trials. The main results from this set of trials are.
1. There is no evidence that OS is prolonged with the use of anthracyclines, although it may have been hampered by the more intense regimens given in the control arms of three of five trials.
2. Anthracyclines improved disease control. Concordantly, less patients progressed or relapsed within three years of treatment with ACR.
3. There is no statistically significant difference in complete or overall response rates.
4. Qualitatively, more side effects were reported with ACR, myelotoxicity and cardiotoxicity included.
This evidence is limited, mainly due to disparities in regimens between control and study arms, but also since most included trials were conducted over one to two decades ago, and only one employed rituximab. Importantly, results from this study were in agreement with pooled-outcomes from trials of the pre-rituximab era.
It is essential to find the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen in conjunction with rituximab and other novel agents, and understand the role of anthracyclines in this combination, especially with current methods that are able to reduce their toxicity. With longer follow-up periods we may better understand whether improved disease control will eventually translate to an increase in survival.
We searched electronic databases of studies (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase). We looked for randomised studies (like tossing a coin) that compared anticoagulant tablets with no treatment or a placebo (tablet with no drug inside) in people with HF who were in sinus rhythm. We found three randomised trials, with 5498 participants, which we used for analysis. Based on the three randomised trials, we are uncertain about the risk of dying between people who took warfarin and those who did not. However, people who took warfarin may have been more likely to have episodes of major bleeding. The evidence suggested that there was no difference in the risk of dying for people who took rivaroxaban compared with those who did not. Rivaroxaban probably reduced the risk of stroke, but the risk of episodes of major bleeding was higher than in those who did not take rivaroxaban.
Our analysis does not support the routine use of anticoagulation in people with HF who remain in sinus rhythm. The literature is current to March 2020.
We identified eleven relevant randomised controlled trials, lasting 1 to 12 months, involving 402 participants. Metabolic control (measured by glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a long-term measure of blood glucose levels) decreased by 0.5% HbA1c with low glycaemic index diet, which is both statistically and clinically significant. Hypoglycaemic episodes significantly decreased with low glycaemic index diet compared to high glycaemic index diet. No study reported on mortality, morbidity or costs.
This review of drugs for weight loss among adults with type 2 diabetes revealed weight loss of between 2.0 and 5.1 kg for fluoxetine, orlistat and sibutramine at follow-up of up to 57 weeks. The long-term effects remain uncertain. Adverse events were common in all three drugs: gastrointestinal side effects with orlistat; tremor, somnolence, and sweating with fluoxetine; and palpitations with sibutramine. There were few studies examining other drugs used for weight loss in populations with diabetes.
We examined the evidence from 17 studies (21 data sets) with 2996 people with reduced kidney function. We found that very low protein diets compared with low or normal protein intakes probably reduce the number of people with advanced kidney failure, who progress to dialysis. When low protein diets were compared with normal protein diets, there was little of no difference in the number of people with less severe kidney failure, who progressed to dialysis. Side effects of low protein diets such as weight loss were uncommon but many studies did not report on side effects. In people with advanced kidney failure, a very low protein intake probably slows the progress to kidney failure. However we need more information on the side effects of low protein diets and on whether quality of life is reduced because of difficulties in keeping to such a diet.
Systematic review of 86 randomised clinical trials including 10,716 patients and statistical analyses of the data showed that coronary artery bypass surgery performed on the beating heart results in an increased risk of death. No firm evidence for benefit or harm was found regarding the outcome measures myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency, or coronary reintervention. Our data raises a warning regarding coronary artery bypass surgery on the beating heart and cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass seem less risky. In patients with contraindications for cannulation of the aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass coronary artery bypass surgery on the beating heart may be a solution but we need randomised clinical trials in these patients to identify the most beneficial approach.
We classified the quality of evidence as very low, because there was only one study, small numbers of participants, and high risk of bias in many domains and missing information regarding tobacco exposure status. Very low-quality evidence suggests there may be an effect of the use of bone marrow-derived stem cells in the healing of ulcers and improving the pain-free walking distance in patients with Buerger's disease. High-quality trials assessing the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) are needed.
We carried out a detailed search of online databases for studies that evaluated or compared (one of) these two tests in CRC screening. The review included only studies in average-risk individuals over 40 years of age without symptoms. The reference standard to compare the test results with was a total endoscopic examination of the large bowel with a camera on a flexible tube passed through the anus (colonoscopy). We reviewed two types of studies: those in which all participants underwent both the stool test and colonoscopy; and those in which only participants with an unfavourable result on the stool test underwent colonoscopy (in these studies, participants who did not have a colonoscopy after the stool test were followed for at least one year to see if they would be diagnosed with colorectal cancer). The evidence is current until 25 June 2019. We ran a top-up search on 14 September 2021, which yielded only one potentially eligible study, currently awaiting classification. The gFOBT 'screenees' – i.e. those who participate in screening – are instructed to collect two faecal samples from three consecutive bowel movements and to smear this on six stool panels. If there is blood in the stool, the panel changes colour. The number of coloured panels for referral to colonoscopy varies between screening programs. In most programs, a single coloured panel is sufficient for referral; however, in others, the number of panels is set at five out of six.
The FIT screenees are instructed to collect one faecal sample from one bowel movement, and to collect this with a brush or spatula into a tube. This tube is then send to a laboratory where the concentration of blood in the stool can be measured. Depending on the height of this concentration, above or below the so-called cut-off or threshold, the screenee is referred for colonoscopy. This cut-off differs per screening program. We analysed 63 studies including almost 4 million individuals. The results of this review indicate that if, in theory, 10,000 people take part in screening with a faecal blood test and 100 people in this group have CRC:
- out of the 100 people with CRC, 24 will be missed in those being screened with FITs.
- out of the 100 people with CRC, 61 will be missed in those being screened with gFOBTs.
We also looked at participants with large polyps, CRC, or both. If, in theory, 10,000 people take part in screening with a faecal blood test and 1000 people in this group have large polyps, CRC, or both:
- out of the 1000 people with large polyps, CRC, or both, 850 will be missed in those being screened with gFOBTs.
- out of the 1000 people with large polyps, CRC, or both, 670 will be missed in those being screened with FITs.
In this theoretical group of 10,000 screenees:
- 594 people being screened with FITs will be offered an 'unnecessary' colonoscopy – unnecessary because they do not have CRC; and
- 594 people being screened with gFOBTs will be offered an 'unnecessary' colonoscopy.
From the results described above, we can see that FITs miss less CRC than gFOBTs, while an equal number of screenees from each type of blood test undergo an unnecessary colonoscopy. The results of the studies are reliable, as the included studies mostly met the quality criteria we specified before commencing the review. More research is needed to investigate whether, in the long term, FIT screening can reduce the number of bowel cancer cases and deaths, and to compare these findings with those from gFOBT screening.
We found 22 randomised controlled trials comparing iron chelators. These do not provide enough information about death or organ damage. However, they showed all three chelators performed similarly well in removing excess iron. Several trials found combining desferrioxamine and deferiprone removed more excess iron than using just one iron chelator.
Trials showing side effects must be considered carefully. Side effects with desferrioxamine included pain or skin reactions at the injection site and joint pain. Side effects with deferiprone included joint pain, nausea, stomach upsets and low white blood cell count. Side effects with deferasirox included skin rashes, increases in liver enzymes and reduced kidney function. Low white blood cell count and reduced kidney function are important side effects and in patients receiving deferiprone or deferasirox these should be monitored regularly. Patients were three times more likely to experience a side effect when deferiprone and desferrioxamine were combined, compared with desferrioxamine alone. Three studies showed that patients using deferiprone were two and a half times more likely to have joint pain compared with using desferrioxamine alone.
We have found no evidence for changing current treatment recommendations, which state that deferiprone or deferasirox should be used to remove excess iron when desferrioxamine cannot be used or is inadequate. The Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America have approved deferiprone only as "last resort treatment of iron overload in thalassemia".
Larger randomised control trials of iron chelation therapy are needed, using standardised agreed measures of iron levels and organ damage to allow comparison of such valuable treatments.
Our review included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs); we included 12 trials, containing a total of 615 people. In most cases, only a single trial that was too small to provide meaningful results investigated the treatments. There was no RCT evidence to support several quite commonly used treatments. The average duration of the trials was four months, long enough to check whether a treatment works initially but not long enough to show the duration of disease control or to detect delayed side effects. The evidence from two trials for clindamycin lotion applied to the skin and oral tetracyclines was relatively weak, despite these antibiotics being standard treatments for mild to moderate HS. There were four pharmaceutical industry-sponsored trials of anti-TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor-alpha) therapies, which included etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab. Of these, a trial of etanercept did not find benefit, whereas a small trial of infliximab reported an improvement in quality of life after eight weeks. A larger trial, including 154 participants, investigated adalimumab. There was no benefit for moderate to severe HS at standard psoriasis doses of 40 mg every other week, but 40 mg weekly did improve quality of life. The estimate of quality of life improvement ranged from a level that probably would help people with HS to a level that might not be enough to justify use of adalimumab. The trial found no increase in serious side effects, including infections, but it was not large enough to detect rare effects. There were no trials investigating when to perform surgery or what surgical procedure to consider. One trial looked at inserting an antibiotic sponge into wounds after removal of HS lesions, but found no benefit compared with surgery without the antibiotic sponge. There were three trials of laser-type treatments, but the trial quality was too low to recommend these therapies. Our review has highlighted a need for more clinical trials to give better evidence to guide treatment choices in HS. More trials of oral treatments are required as well as surgical studies. Future trials should include patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and pain.
Whilst ALA has been used as part of the treatment for a variety of neurological disorders, no placebo-controlled randomized trials have been conducted for its use in degenerative dementias. ALA for the treatment of dementia of any subtype cannot currently be recommended.
This review compared these treatments and found both were equally effective at preventing death but using stents was better than balloon angioplasty because fewer arteries needed to be re-cleared and stents prevented more heart attacks than balloon angioplasty.
We wanted to find out which shift schedule adaptations improve sleep on rest days and reduce sleepiness at work. We searched for studies that evaluated the following features of shift schedules.
• Whether shift schedules changed (rotated) or stayed the same
• Whether shift changes were regular or irregular
• Direction of shift rotation (morning to afternoon to night or night to afternoon to morning)
• Speed of rotation
• Shift duration
• Timing of start of shifts
• Distribution of shift schedule (fewer shifts with more hours or more shifts with fewer hours)
• Time off between shifts
• Split (interrupted) shifts
• Whether workers had on-call shifts
• Whether workers were involved in organising the shift schedule We included 11 studies, with 2125 participants. One study was conducted in a laboratory; we disregarded the results of this study when drawing conclusions. Most studies investigated a change in one feature of the shift schedule, while some investigated changes in two features. Four studies investigated the effect of changes in direction of shift rotation, three studies speed of rotation, five studies changes in shift duration, and one study changes in the distribution of days off.
Forward rotation compared to backward rotation may have no effect on sleep duration or sleep quality on rest days, but may reduce sleepiness at work. However, all of these results are very uncertain.
Faster shift rotation compared to slower shift rotation may have no effect on sleep quality on rest days. Faster rotation may reduce sleep duration on rest days, but may also reduce sleepiness at work; however, the evidence for both results is very uncertain.
Two studies investigated 80-hour workweeks among doctors. They found that a schedule with shifts of no more than 16 hours, compared with a schedule with unlimited shift duration (including shifts of 24 to 28 hours), may increase sleep duration on rest days and probably results in a slight reduction in sleepiness at work.
Shorter shift duration (eight or 10 hours) compared to longer shift duration (two to three hours longer) may have no effect on sleep quality or sleep duration on rest days, but the results are very uncertain. The effects of shift duration on sleepiness differed across studies.
Changes in the distribution shift schedules (e.g. two days versus four days off in a row) may have no effect on sleep quality or sleep duration on rest days, but the results are very uncertain.
We found no studies investigating other changes in shift schedules.
Overall, there is a need for more high-quality studies to draw firm conclusions on the effects of shift schedule changes on sleep and sleepiness. Currently, we cannot draw useful conclusions from the available evidence. Too few of the included studies allocated workers to the schedule change at random. In addition, many studies included few workers and lacked reliable measurements of sleep and sleepiness. The evidence is up-to-date to 13 December 2020.
We searched scientific databases for randomised trials in which people scheduled for CABG (with or without valve surgery) were randomly assigned to receive RIPC or sham intervention before surgery. The evidence is current to May 2016. We did not identify any source of bias related to the funding of included studies. We identified 29 studies involving 5392 participants (mean age = 64 years, age range 23 to 86 years, 82% male). RIPC does not improve clinical outcome in people undergoing CABG with or without valve surgery (measured as a composite endpoint including all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or any new stroke, or both, assessed at 30 days after surgery, moderate-quality evidence). There is moderate-quality evidence that RIPC reduces the amount of cardiac troponin T release measured at 72 hours and measured as AUC (72 hours). There is moderate-quality evidence that cardiac troponin I release measured at 48 hours and 72 hours after surgery is lower in the RIPC group than in the control group. Regarding troponin T measured at 48 hours and troponin I measured as AUC 72 hours after surgery there was no difference between groups (low- and moderate-quality evidence). However, this effect on biomarkers does not result in improved clinical outcome. We used reliable methods to assess the quality of the trial evidence. The quality of the evidence of key outcomes ranged from moderate to low quality due to the presence of moderate or high statistical heterogeneity, imprecision of results or due to limitations in the design of individual studies.
We found eight clinical studies in October 2014, that examined the blood pressure lowering effect of carvedilol and labetalol in 1493 participants with high blood pressure. These people were randomly assigned to receive either a fixed dose of dual receptor blockers or a placebo for 3 to 12 weeks. On average, dual receptor blockers lowered systolic BP by six points, diastolic BP by four points and heart rate by five beats per minute in patients with mild to moderate high blood pressure. There were more data on the effects of carvedilol. On average, carvedilol lowered systolic BP by four points and diastolic BP by three points. Higher doses of dual receptor blockers caused more slowing of heart rate but not more lowering of BP. The BP lowering effect of dual receptor blockers was less than other classes of BP lowering drugs. Patients taking dual receptor blockers were not more likely to withdraw from the study compared to patients taking placebo. The quality of the evidence was judged to be low due to various types of bias that could exaggerate the effect. A low quality of evidence means future research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
The review of trials found, when compared to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), high-frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV) reduced the risk of air leak and triggered ventilation was associated with a shorter duration of ventilation. Compared to high-frequency oscillation, however, certain triggered modes of ventilation resulted in a greater risk of moderate to severe chronic lung disease and a longer duration of ventilation. Newer forms of triggered ventilation have only been evaluated in small randomised trials and have not been demonstrated to have advantages in important clinical outcomes.
The review covered 10 trials, involving 6533 women, and looked at several antioxidants. Overall the review found no reduction in pre-eclampsia, high blood pressure or preterm birth with the use of antioxidant supplements. When antioxidants were assessed separately, there were insufficient data to be clear about whether there was any benefit or not, except for vitamin C and E. The current evidence does not support the use of antioxidants to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia or other complications in pregnancy, but there are trials still in progress.
We found 14 studies with a total of 747 participants (260 adults; 487 children). The volume of saline used in the studies varied: five studies used 'very low' volumes (nasal sprays providing less than 5 mL saline per nostril per application), two studies used low-volume (between 5 and 59 mL saline per nostril per application introduced with a syringe) and four studies used high-volume solutions (more than 60 mL per nostril per application). Eight studies used hypertonic saline, five used isotonic saline and three studies did not provide this information. Two studies used two different types of saline solutions. Seven studies did not say how they were funded. The other seven were funded either by the investigators' department or research grants from regional or national government. No studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Nasal saline irrigation compared with no saline irrigation
Nasal saline irrigation may have benefits in both adults and children in relieving the symptoms of allergic rhinitis compared to no saline irrigation and it is unlikely to be associated with adverse effects. It is not possible to tell from this review whether there is a difference between the different volumes and concentrations of saline solution.
Adding nasal saline irrigation onto 'pharmacological' allergic rhinitis treatment
It is uncertain whether adding nasal saline irrigation to pharmacological treatment (intranasal steroids or oral antihistamines) helps to improve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis compared to using pharmacological treatments alone. The use of nasal saline irrigation is unlikely to be associated with adverse effects.
Nasal saline irrigation compared to 'pharmacological' allergic rhinitis treatment
There is not enough evidence to know whether nasal saline irrigation is better, worse or the same as using intranasal steroids. No studies reporting the outcomes we were interested in compared nasal saline irrigation with oral antihistamines. The overall quality of evidence for nasal saline irrigation compared with no saline treatment was eitherlow quality (our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect) or very low quality (we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect). This was because the studies were mostly very small and used different methods to measure the same outcome. Since saline irrigation could provide a cheap, safe and acceptable alternative to intranasal steroids and antihistamines further high-quality studies are needed.
Cochrane authors conducted a review including 90 randomised controlled trials comparing 18 different antioxidants with placebo, no treatment or another antioxidant in a total population of 10,303 subfertile men. The age range of the participants was 18 to 65 years; they were part of a couple who had been referred to a fertility clinic and some were undergoing fertility treatment. The evidence is current to February 2021. Antioxidants may be associated with an increased live birth and clinical pregnancy rate. Based on the studied population for live birth, we would expect that out of 100 subfertile men not taking antioxidants, 16 couples would have a baby. In subfertile men taking antioxidants, between 17 and 27 per 100 couples would have a baby. If studies with high risk of bias were removed from the analysis, there was no evidence of increased live birth in the population taking antioxidants. In the people who were studied for clinical pregnancy, we would expect that out of 100 subfertile men not taking antioxidants, 15 couples would have a clinical pregnancy. In subfertile men taking antioxidants, between 20 and 30 per 100 couples would have a clinical pregnancy. Adverse events were poorly reported. Only six studies reported miscarriage. In these studies, miscarriage did not occur more often in the group using antioxidants when compared with the group with placebo or no treatment. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about antioxidant use and the risk of miscarriage. The use of antioxidants may be associated with more mild stomach discomfort, with a frequency of 2% in subfertile men not taking antioxidants, and between 2% and 7% in men taking antioxidants. The oral supplements may cause discomforts such as nausea or stomach ache. Antioxidant supplementation taken by subfertile males of a couple attending a fertility clinic may increase the chance of a live birth, however the overall certainty of evidence was very low from only 12 small to medium-sized randomised controlled trials. Low-certainty evidence suggests that clinical pregnancy rates may increase. Overall, there is no evidence of increased risk of miscarriage. Evidence of low certainty suggests that antioxidants may be associated with more gastrointestinal discomfort. Subfertile couples should be advised that overall the current evidence is inconclusive due to the poor reporting of methods, failure to report on live birth and clinical pregnancy rate, imprecision due to low event rates, high number of dropouts and small study group sizes. Large well-designed randomised placebo-controlled trials studying infertile men and reporting on pregnancy and live births are still required to clarify the exact role of antioxidants.
We found eight studies with 381 participants. All studies evaluated eyeglasses. We found no studies evaluating contact lenses or surgery. Two studies looked at progressive computer glasses where the focus gradually changes from nearby to the distance of the computer screen but one did not report any data. Two studies examined progressive computer glasses in which the focus also extended a couple of meters beyond the computer screen. Five studies looked at progressive computer glasses whose focus gradually changed to far distance. One study examined if the spectacles that participants already had could be improved and whether that influenced their computer vision, but the study did not provide data. We judged the risk of bias to be unclear in four studies, high in two and low in another study.
What are the main results of the review?
Progressive computer glasses compared to other types of computer glasses
One study found no difference in eye symptoms after one year between progressive computer glasses and computer glasses with only one focus.
Progressive computer glasses including middle distance focus in the upper part of the glasses compared to other types of glasses
Two studies found a small difference in eye symptoms between progressive computer glasses including middle distance focus and progressive glasses for everyday use when the glasses had been used for a period of one week to one month. There was no difference in dizziness between the two kinds of glasses. Another study found no difference in eye symptoms after one year between progressive computer glasses and computer glasses with only one focus.
Progressive computer glasses including far-away focus in the upper part of the glasses compared to other types of glasses
Two different studies found no difference in eye symptoms after one month between computer glasses including a far-away focus and bifocal or trifocal computer glasses. Another study found that after one year glasses with only one focus were just as good as computer glasses. One study compared progressive computer glasses to an assessment of the participant's computer work station and own (computer) glasses and found an improvement of asthenopia symptom-score of about 40%.
How up-to-date is this review?
We searched for studies that had been published up to 20 December, 2017.
We found three studies that recruited a total of 59 cancer patients (37 men and 22 women) aged between 54 and 78 years. Forty-seven cancer patients completed the treatment. Studies differed in study design and included people with a variety of cancers. Studies also differed in dosage, route of injection, frequency and duration of treatment. One study compared ghrelin with a placebo while two studies compared different doses of ghrelin (higher dose with lower dose). Outcomes of interest to cancer patients with loss of appetite and weight loss, such as improvement in food intake and improvement in body weight, were not adequately reported.
All three included studies were funded by government agencies. One study received an additional grant from a pharmaceutical company. We found insufficient evidence that using ghrelin demonstrated differences in food intake. We found no evidence that using ghrelin alone or in combination made any difference to body weight. We could not reach any conclusions about its side effects. The limited amount of information means that we could not draw any conclusions. We rated the quality of evidence from studies using four levels: high, moderate, low, or very low. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. The evidence in this review was of very low quality.
This review included five randomised controlled trials involving 244 participants. A combined analysis of trials using our primary outcome showed that the 'risk' of success in a patient who received radiotherapy was 1.92 times that of a patient who did not receive radiotherapy. Single studies suggested that orbital radiotherapy in combination with steroids had a better outcome than steroids alone. There was no significant change in quality-of-life information collected in the orbital radiotherapy groups compared to the other groups. The short-term adverse events reported in the trials were mild and localised to the area of treatment (redness of skin and temporal hair loss). However, trial methodology may have led to a decreased rate of adverse events from radiotherapy. Three trials excluded diabetic patients and these patients have been reported, in the literature, to be at higher risk of developing radiation retinopathy and of having progression of pre-existing diabetic retinopathy. Some studies did not report on retinal changes at all.
we organized our study to compare the effect of low versus high PEEP levels, which we defined as: less than 5 cmH2O (low) versus 5 cmH2O or greater (high). Our primary outcomes were death by hospital discharge (for RDS) or two years of age (for BPD) and neurodevelopmental impairment (problems with growth and development of the brain or central nervous system) at two years of age. We identified four trials. Two trials with 28 infants compared different PEEP levels in infants with RDS. Two trials with 44 infants compared approaches for individually selecting PEEP levels. The compared approaches were: routine, typical practice (control) versus a "lung-recruitment maneuver." With this maneuver, investigators slowly increased and then decreased PEEP levels while monitoring for improvements in oxygenation to guide PEEP level selection. The evidence is up to date to 14 February 2018. two trials comparing different PEEP levels in RDS did not report on any patient important outcomes. They compared the short-term effect of different PEEP levels on pulmonary gas exchange, and found no differences between low and high PEEP levels. The two trials comparing the lung-recruitment maneuver to control reported survival to hospital discharge or the development of BPD and found no clear difference between groups. However, they did suggest that an infant receiving the maneuver may have required less time on conventional mechanical ventilation and had better oxygenation for a period after the maneuver. The quality of the evidence for these results was low because they were small studies and vulnerable to bias from limitations in the study methods. evidence-based guidance for PEEP level selection in preterm infants continues to be limited. We are unable to make recommendations for clinical practice based on our findings. This review should raise awareness of the lack of high-quality research evidence guiding the selection of PEEP levels in preterm infants and encourage further research. Additional research evaluating lung-recruitment maneuvers as an approach for individually selecting PEEP levels would be particularly valuable, given our findings of possible but uncertain benefit with this approach.
Our searches identified a large body of trial evidence and also a substantial body of work in progress. This revealed that telehealthcare initiatives are unlikely to be of benefit in improving quality of life for the majority of people with relatively mild asthma, but that these interventions may prove useful in preventing exacerbations and hospital admissions in people with more severe asthma. We believe it is important for more research to be done to establish the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.
The strength of this review's findings were limited by the number, size, and quality of eligible trials. Further research is needed before strong scientific conclusions and sound clinical recommendations can be made.
We searched up to 1 February 2015 and found four studies with a maximum of 334 participants with information for analysis. Ibuprofen 200 mg plus caffeine 100 mg provided effective pain relief for 6 in 10 (59%) participants, compared with 1 in 10 (11%) participants with placebo (moderate quality evidence).
Adverse events occurred at similar rates with the ibuprofen plus caffeine combination and placebo in these single dose studies (low quality evidence). No serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events occurred with the combination.
The combination of ibuprofen 200 mg + caffeine 100 mg is not commonly available, but can probably be achieved by taking a single 200 mg ibuprofen tablet with a cup of modestly strong coffee. Common sources of caffeine include not only caffeine tablets (100 mg is sufficient), but coffee (100 mg to 150 mg per mug or cup with a volume of about 240 mL or 8 fl oz, or a double espresso), but also tea (75 mg per mug), cola drinks (up to 40 mg per drink), energy drinks (approximately 80 mg per drink), plain chocolate (up to 50 mg per bar), and caffeine tablets (100 mg per tablet).
Some people may get good levels of pain relief with a lower dose of ibuprofen when the ibuprofen is combined with caffeine.
This systematic review assesses the randomised trials that have addressed the effective ness of this additional chemotherapy. Seven studies have been published in this field, and the combined analysis shows that survival is not improved by hepatic artery chemotherapy.
A total of seven randomized controlled studies met the inclusion criteria and enrolled a total of 606 participants. Because of differences in the way that the studies were designed, we were unable to combine their reported results. The results from individual studies that compared heparin at a dose of 1 to 2 IU/mL under continuous pressure were imprecise and do not provide definitive evidence of a difference. The effective dose of heparin has not yet been determined. This evidence needs to be confirmed in future trials. All studies had a moderate to high risk of methodological bias. The review of trials therefore revealed that more research is needed to determine exactly how long an arterial catheter maintained with a normal saline flush solution can be in place and remain functional (to accurately measure blood pressure and pulse and to provide blood samples that can be used to monitor oxygenation and other variables).
We found 12 studies that explored whether or not checking reference lists was useful for systematic reviews. These studies reported a range of results, from identifying only a few additional studies (2.5%: 2 of 79 included studies) to identifying many additional studies (42.7%: 111 of 260 included studies) through checking reference lists. Unfortunately, none of the studies looked at how much time or money were spent on the process of checking reference lists, and it was suggested this would be almost impossible to estimate.
Unfortunately our findings are based on weak information. The data do suggest that in situations where researchers may have difficulty locating information, checking through the reference lists may be an important way to reduce the risk of missing relevant information.
The review included 21 clinical trials comparing tDCS versus sham tDCS involving 421 participants with aphasia due to first-time stroke. We found no evidence that tDCS may help improve language recovery in terms of everyday communication or thinking abilities. However, there is limited evidence that tDCS may improve a person’s ability to name nouns. We could not identify any serious harmful effects and the number of harmful events and withdrawals from the trials was not increased. Further trials are needed in this area to determine whether this treatment works in routine practice. Authors of future research should adhere to current research quality standards. The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate.
On average, people taking eszopiclone fell asleep 12 minutes faster than those taking placebo, were 17 minutes less awake during the night and had, in total, about half an hour more sleep than people in the placebo group. As side effects, eszopiclone can cause unpleasant taste, dizziness, dry mouth, and tiredness during the day. Clinical studies did not find evidence that eszopiclone was causing serious harm or withdrawal symptoms or whether it was addictive if it was stopped and not taken after several weeks or months of treatment. Nevertheless, as clinical studies included in the review did not cover certain groups (e.g. elderly people with cognitive or motor problems or certain conditions of medication intake), it is important for patients to consult their doctor who knows their medical history and condition. Future research needs to compare eszopiclone with other sleep medications to help physicians and patients decide which of the available treatment options to prefer. In addition, sleep medications that are also well tolerated by elderly individuals and individuals with alcohol or drug problems need to be identified.
We wanted to know if patients who received thrombolysis after subarachnoid haemorrhage had better outcomes than patients who did not. We performed a systematic search of medical databases to find studies evaluating thrombolysis as a treatment to improve outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. We looked for a reliable type of study known as a 'randomised controlled trial'. We combined the results of the studies we identified from our search to assess the effects of thrombolysis. We identified eight studies from six different countries that met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 410 individuals with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Of these individuals, 205 received thrombolysis. Nearly all included participants had high-grade subarachnoid haemorrhage. Studies had a variety of different approaches to using thrombolysis, including different doses and routes of administration (e.g. via an external drain or during open surgery). Individuals who received thrombolysis after high-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage were less likely to have severe disability, cerebral artery vasospasm, or delayed cerebral ischaemia than those who did not receive thrombolysis. However, they were not more or less likely to die or have a bleeding complication than individuals without thrombolysis. Nor were they more or less likely to have a stroke or a build-up of fluid on the brain. We have low to moderate certainty about the evidence we found. The main limitation of the evidence is the small number of participants in the studies, and the small number of instances of each outcome. Additionally, the studies included in this analysis used various different approaches to thrombolysis; due to the small number of studies, we were not able to study the effect of these different approaches on the outcomes. It is also unclear how thrombolysis affects less severe cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage. This evidence is up to date to 9 March 2023.
A handful of psychological therapies have been researched in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions. Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long-term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long-term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health-related anxiety in this population. Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions.
We found nine studies with 727 participants testing antipsychotics for delirium treatment; four trials compared an antipsychotic to another drug class or placebo and seven of the nine trials compared a typical antipsychotic to an atypical antipsychotic. We found no evidence to support or refute the suggestion that antipsychotics shorten the course of delirium in hospitalised patients. Based on the available studies, antipsychotics do not reduce the severity of delirium or resolve symptoms compared to nonantipsychotic drugs or placebo or lower the risk of dying. We found no evidence to support or refute the suggestion that antipsychotics shorten hospital length of stay or improve health-related quality of life. Side effects were rarely reported in the studies. It is important to note many clinically relevant outcomes were not reported in the studies and the overall quality of the available evidence was poor.

There was not a significant effect on weight gain in the one randomized controlled trial identified that investigated addition of lactase. The review authors searched the medical literature thoroughly but found only this one high quality trial enrolling 130 preterm infants. No adverse effects were noted and lactase treated feeds appeared to be well tolerated.
– Analyses including 10 studies found that I-C/BT was more effective than no therapy (waiting list), at reducing PTSD. However, the certainty of the evidence was very low, which means we have very little confidence in this finding.
– Analyses including two studies found there was no difference between I-C/BT and another type of psychological therapy delivered online. However, the certainty of the evidence was very low, which means we have very little confidence in this finding.
– One study found that face-to-face non-CBT was more effective than I-C/BT. However, baseline levels of PTSD symptoms were not controlled for and the certainty of this evidence was very low, which limits our confidence in this finding.
– We found no studies using standardised or validated measures of acceptability to tell us whether people who received I-C/BT felt it was an acceptable treatment.
– We found no studies that reported the cost-effectiveness of I-C/BT. The current evidence base is growing but still small. More studies are needed to decide if I-C/BT should be used routinely for the treatment of PTSD.
Although a number of randomized controlled trials have been undertaken, data were available from only a very limited number of these studies. These limited data suggest that propentofylline may have a beneficial effect on measures of cognitive and global function of people with Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. The unavailability of data, due to failure of Aventis, the manufacturing pharmaceutical company, to release information about unpublished studies prevented a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.
We searched the literature up to October 2013 and found 16 studies with 866 women and 15 men with fibromyalgia; 439 were assigned to aquatic training programs.
Nine studies compared aquatic exercise to no exercise; five studies compared aquatic exercise to land-based exercise, and two studies compared aquatic training to a different aquatic training.  Those who did aquatic exercise rated their overall well-being six units better at the end of the study than those who did not exercise. Those who did aquatic exercise rated their ability to function four units better at the end of the study than those who did not exercise. Those who did aquatic exercise rated their pain seven units better at the end of the study than those who did not exercise. Those who did aquatic exercise rated their stiffness 18 units better at the end of the study than those who did not exercise. People who did aquatic training improved their muscle strength by 37% more than those who did not do aquatic training. Those who did aquatic exercise walked 37 meters further at the end of the study than those who did not exercise. Two more participants out of 100 in the aquatic training groups dropped out of the studies (15 aquatic exercisers dropped out while 13 non-exercisers dropped out). Further research on overall well being and ability to function is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these results and may change the results.
Further research on pain, stiffness, muscle strength, and cardiovascular fitness is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these results and is likely to change the results. People who did both programs had similar results for overall well-being, physical function, pain, and stiffness. However, people who exercise on land improved their muscle strength by 9% more than those who did aquatic training. About the same number of people from both groups dropped out. As so few studies have been done so far, we are very uncertain about the results. There were two studies in this comparison: one compared Ai Chi (Tai Chi in the water) to stretching in the water, and the other compared aquatic training in a pool to aquatic training in sea water. The only important difference found was for stiffness, favoring the Ai Chi aquatic training. As so few studies have been done so far, further research is likely to change this result.
The evidence is current to December 2013. We found four studies that used VBM in 275 adolescents and adults with first episode psychosis. One study recruited participants from a hospital, one from an outpatient clinic and one from inpatient and outpatient psychiatric services, and the fourth study did not report setting. Participants' mean age ranged from 18.6 to 27.1 years. Only two studies reported on participants' gender and included both males and females. Study quality was found to be fairly good overall. In some instances it was unclear, mainly due to three of the studies that did not sufficiently describe method of VBM image processing. We were concerned about all of the studies' applicability because VBM was not used to diagnose schizophrenia in any of the studies, instead VBM was used to characterise differences in the brain's grey matter. The four studies we identified used VBM on adolescents and adults with first episode psychosis, but VBM was used to describe brain structure and not to make a diagnosis. There is no evidence to support the use of VBM to diagnose schizophrenia in patients with first episode psychosis.
Nine small randomised trials involving 510 adults with potentially or evidently unstable fractures, were grouped into five comparisons. The trials were too different to justify pooling of results. Only one trial used a best-practice method for preventing selection bias.
Two trials comparing a bridging (of the wrist) external fixator versus pins and plaster external fixation found no statistically significant differences in function or deformity. One trial found tendencies for more serious complications but less subsequent discomfort and deformity in the fixator group.
Three trials compared non-bridging versus bridging fixation, using external fixators. Two trials tested similar non-bridging fixators: one found no significant differences in functional or clinical outcomes, whereas the other found non-bridging fixation significantly improved grip strength, wrist flexion and anatomical outcome. The third trial found no significant findings in favour of multi-planar non-bridging fixation of complex fractures.
One trial using a bridging external fixator found that fixing the distal fracture fragment with an extra external fixator pin gave superior functional and anatomical results.
One trial found no evidence of differences in clinical outcomes for hydroxyapatite coated pins compared with standard uncoated pins.
Two trials compared dynamic versus static external fixation. One trial found no significant effects from the early 'dynamism' of an external fixator. The poor quality of the other trial undermines its findings of poorer results for dynamic fixation.
The review concluded that there is insufficient robust evidence to determine the relative effects of the different methods of external fixation.
We identified five randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) enrolling a total of 266 adults with primary hyperparathyroidism, who were assigned to one of two surgical techniques (136 participants to the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group and 130 to the bilateral neck exploration group). One of the studies followed up participants up to five years, but the rest reported data until one year. Within six months, operative success as measured by normal blood calcium levels after operation, was found in 97% of participants in the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group compared with 99% in the bilateral neck exploration group. Five years after the surgery the proportions were 90% in the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group compared to 95% in the bilateral neck exploration group. About 17% of participants in the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group reported unwanted events around the time of the operation compared with 34% in the bilateral neck exploration group. These events consisted mostly of symptoms of low calcium levels (such as numbness, tingling cramps) occurring in 14% of the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group and in 27% in the bilateral neck exploration group. A total of 5/133 (4%) participants in the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group experienced vocal cord paralysis compared with 2/128 (2%) participants in the bilateral neck exploration group. Other events included bleeding, fever and infection, which were comparable in both groups. The effect on death from any cause was not explicitly reported. There were no clear differences for health-related quality of life between the treatment groups in two studies. There was a possible treatment benefit for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy compared to bilateral neck exploration in terms of cosmetic satisfaction. The duration of surgery was 18 minutes less for the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy technique compared with bilateral neck exploration. Four studies reported a switch from minimally invasive parathyroidectomy to bilateral neck exploration during the operation where 24/115 (21%) participants underwent the more extensive surgery. The quality of the evidence was low or very low mainly because of the small number of studies and participants.
This evidence is current to 21 October 2019.
The findings of this systematic review suggest that proper management of a type of strong painkiller (opioids) in well-selected patients with no history of substance addiction or abuse can lead to long-term pain relief for some patients with a very small (though not zero) risk of developing addiction, abuse, or other serious side effects. However, the evidence supporting these conclusions is weak, and longer-term studies are needed to identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment.
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials (October 2019) and identified 28 studies (2749 mothers) who were in hospital after uncomplicated single births. Most of the evidence is low-certainty because the studies did not include sufficient numbers of women. Many of the studies excluded breastfeeding women.This makes the evidence less relevant to a broader group of women. No studies reported evidence on adverse events in the newborn infants.
NSAIDs are probably better than placebo (a dummy treatment) in giving adequate pain relief as reported by the women (11 studies, 946 women; moderate-certainty evidence), and they may reduce the need for additional pain relief (4 studies, 375 women; low-certainty evidence). There may be little difference between NSAIDs and placebo in the risk of adverse events in the mother (9 studies, 598 women; low-certainty evidence).
NSAIDs are probably better than opioids in providing adequate pain relief as reported by the women (5 studies, 560 women; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of adverse events in the mother (3 studies, 255 women; low-certainty evidence). NSAIDs may slightly reduce the need for additional pain relief compared with opioids (2 studies, 232 women; low-certainty evidence).
Opioids may be better than placebo for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (5 studies, 299 women; low-certainty evidence) and for the need for additional pain relief (3 studies, 273 women; low-certainty evidence). Opioids may increase the risk of adverse events in the mother compared with placebo (3 studies, 188 women; low-certainty evidence).
Very low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if paracetamol is better than placebo for adequate pain relief as reported by the women, the need for additional analgesia, or risk of maternal adverse events (2 studies, 123 women).
Very low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if there are any differences between paracetamol and NSAIDs for adequate pain relief as reported by the women, or the risk of maternal adverse events (2 studies, 112 women).
Very low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if NSAIDs are better than herbal pain relief for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (4 studies, 394 women), the need for additional pain relief (1 study, 90 women) or risk of maternal adverse events (1 study, 108 women).
Very low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if there is any difference between TENS and no TENS for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (1 study, 32 women). NSAIDs may be better than placebo and are probably better than opioids at relieving after-birth pains following vaginal birth. The quality of the evidence was poor and we are uncertain about the effectiveness of other forms of pain relief. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of women and ensure greater relevance by including breastfeeding women. Further research could also include a survey of women after delivery to capture their experience of after-birth pains following vaginal birth.
The seven identified studies included too few patients to answer the questions. Four studies evaluated which is the best time to place implants. One study evaluated whether bone grafting is advantageous at implant placement and two studies evaluated which are the best grafting techniques.
There is currently too little evidence to draw any reliable conclusions, however, the aesthetic outcome could be slightly better when placing implants early after tooth extraction, though early placed implants might be at a higher risk of failure. There is not enough evidence supporting or refusing the need of bone augmentation when extracted teeth are immediately replaced with dental implants, nor it is known whether any augmentation procedure is better than the others. Bone substitutes (anorganic bovine bone) can be used instead of self generated (autogenous) bone graft.
The reviewers conclude that the benefit of light treatment is modest though promising for non-seasonal depression. The short-term treatment as well as light administered in the morning and with concomitant sleep deprivation in sleep deprivation responders appear to be most beneficial for treatment response. Hypomania as a potential adverse effect needs to be considered. Due to limited data and heterogeneity of studies these results need to be interpreted with caution.
We found 35 studies with 5136 women that examined 16 different NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.). We included studies up to 9 December 2019. The studies we found only included women who had trauma of the perineum and who were not breastfeeding. Studies were conducted between 1967 and 2013 and had few women in them. adequate pain reliefat six hours.
Women who received a single dose of NSAID are probably less likely to need additional pain relief at four hours (moderate-certainty evidence) after taking the drug compared to women who received placebo or no treatment. We are uncertain if there is any difference between NSAIDs and placebo for women needing additional pain relief at six hours (very low-certainty evidence). Not all of the studies assessed adverse effects of the drugs, but some studies reported maternal adverse effects such as drowsiness, headache, weakness, nausea, gastric discomfort. The evidence is very uncertain about the difference in maternal adverse effects between NSAIDs and placebo at six hours after administration (very low-certainty evidence). One small study (90 women) reported that there were no maternal adverse effects at four hours after administration. None of the studies measured possible adverse effects on the baby. adequate pain reliefat six hours or in the number of women who need additional pain relief at four hours after administration. Women who receive NSAID may be less likely to need additional pain relief at six hours compared to women who received paracetamol. One study reported that nomaternal adverse effectswere observed at four hours (210 women). Three small studies reported maternal adverse effects at six hours after administration but we are uncertain if there is any difference between the groups. Adverse effects on the baby were not reported in any of the included studies and all studies excluded women who were breastfeeding.
Comparisons of different NSAIDs and different doses of the same NSAID did not demonstrate any clear differences in their effectiveness on any of the main outcomes measured in this review. However, little information was available for some NSAIDs.
None of the included studies reported on any of this review's secondary outcomes, including: extended hospital stay or readmission to hospital for perineal pain; breastfeeding; perineal pain at six weeks after having the baby; women's views, postpartum depression or measures of disability due to perineal pain. For women who are not breastfeeding, a single dose of a NSAID may be better than placebo or paracetamol for perineal pain at four hours. No serious side effects were reported, but not all studies examined these. For women who breastfeed, there are no data and these women should seek help, as some NSAIDs are not recommended for women who breastfeed.
This systematic review of diet, physical activity, and behavioral interventions for weight loss, revealed a decrease in weight of 1.7 kg at one year or more. These results were minimized by weight loss in the comparison group, however. No data were identified on quality of life or mortality.
Screening with mammography uses X-ray imaging to find breast cancer before a lump can be felt. The goal is to treat cancer earlier, when a cure is more likely. The review includes seven trials that involved 600,000 women in the age range 39 to 74 years who were randomly assigned to receive screening mammograms or not. The studies which provided the most reliable information showed that screening did not reduce breast cancer mortality. Studies that were potentially more biased (less carefully done) found that screening reduced breast cancer mortality. However, screening will result in some women getting a cancer diagnosis even though their cancer would not have led to death or sickness. Currently, it is not possible to tell which women these are, and they are therefore likely to have breasts or lumps removed and to receive radiotherapy unnecessarily. If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% after 13 years of follow-up and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings.
Women invited to screening should be fully informed of both the benefits and harms. To help ensure that the requirements for informed choice for women contemplating whether or not to attend a screening programme can be met, we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk. Because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out, it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials. Recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening.
Three clinical trials involving/completed by 113 babies were identified that compared double-lumen catheters to single-lumen catheters. None of the studies used triple-lumen catheters. All three trials found that use of a double-lumen catheter lowered the number of additional venous placements needed during the first week of life. The double-lumen catheters, however, clogged, leaked, and broke more often. In these studies, no significant difference was found in catheter placement difficulty and misplacement, catheter-related infections or blood clots, other serious complications, or rate of infant mortality. But the quality of studies was poor, and sample sizes were too small to draw valid conclusions about many complication rates. Available clinical trials at present do not provide a basis for recommending one catheter type over another in this setting.
To date, little is known about what might help people diagnosed with BPD when they are experiencing an acute crisis. In this review, we wanted to discover whether crisis interventions are effective for people diagnosed with BPD by looking at evidence from randomised controlled trials (where some participants (intervention group) are randomly assigned to receive an experimental treatment, and the others (control group) are randomly assigned to receive a dummy treatment (placebo), no treatment or the usual treatment). We searched medical databases and found two studies that addressed this issue.
In one study, the intervention group had a joint crisis plan (a document explaining their treatment preferences for the management of future crises, which they could carry with them and refer to in the event of a crisis). This document is similar to a wellness recovery action plan, but is written with a mental health professional, rather than only by the individual. The intervention group also had access to usual care, which was provided by a community mental health team and included regular contact with an allocated member of the team. The control group received usual care only.
In the other study, the intervention group could choose to be admitted to a mental health hospital for up to three days at a time of crisis (brief admission), in addition to receiving usual care. The control group received usual care only.
Government research councils and non-profit foundations funded the studies. In the joint crisis plan study, there was no clear evidence of an effect on death, self-harm, time spent in a mental health hospital, and quality of life. The written document may be more cost-effective than usual treatment, but the study authors were not confident about this.
The brief admission study showed no clear evidence of a difference between brief admission and the usual treatment for death, self-harm, suicide attempts, violence perpetration, and admission to a mental health hospital. We have little confidence in the evidence, because it does not cover all the people we were interested in, it was based on only one study, and the participants reported some results themselves.
Given that crises in people diagnosed with BPD are distressing and potentially dangerous periods associated with increased risk of suicide, further research is urgently needed to enhance the evidence base in this area. This research should be in the form of large, well-designed trials so that we can be confident in the effect of the intervention. The searches were completed in January 2022.
This review involved searching the literature for well-conducted (randomised) studies that compared ECT to both simulated ECT and to antidepressants. The review found only four studies, all of which had serious problems in their methods. At present, therefore, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on whether ECT is more effective than antidepressants,.or on the safety or side effects of ECT in elderly people with depression.
We searched the literature for studies that used vasopressin or its analogue terlipressin in the newborn in the first 28 days of life for unresponsive hypotension. We found no ongoing or completed studies. Currently there is no evidence to recommend the use of vasopressin or terlipressin, but we recommend that studies be carried out in the future to study the effectiveness and safety in unresponsive hypotension in newborn infants.
The evidence is current to July 2014. We included in our analysis three multicenter randomized trials involving a total of 2303 participants. All three trials recruited participants aged 60 years or younger with a cryptogenic stroke or minor stroke and had a PFO diagnosed by specialist heart scan. 1150 participants were randomized to the TDC group where the procedure was performed with the Amplatzer device in two studies, and with the STARFlex device in one study. The mean follow-up period of all three included trials was less than five years. Two studies were sponsored by St Jude Medical and one study was sponsored by NMT Medical. We found that, when compared with medical therapy, TDC failed to show any significant benefit in reducing the risk of recurrent stroke or similar events. However, there was a possible protective effect on recurrent strokes in those participants for whom an Amplatzer device was used compared with medical therapy. We did not find evidence that TDC increased the rate of serious adverse events overall. However, TDC increased the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation (where there is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat) and may be associated with the type of device used. We performed this systematic review of three randomized trials to compare both the safety and efficacy of TDC with medical therapy on recurrent cerebrovascular events in people with cryptogenic stroke and PFO following theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.The major problem in terms of risk of bias is the high dropout rate compared with event rate in these three trials and different dropout rates between groups. Meanwhile, we lack individual-level data for analysis. Although there is a suggestion of potential benefit with the Amplatzer device closure in preventing recurrent stroke, our findings still need to be confirmed in further studies.
We searched up to February 2020 for well-designed trials that compared any medicine used for treating sleep problems in people with dementia with a fake medicine (placebo). We consulted a panel of carers to help us identify the most important outcomes to look for in the trials.
We found nine trials (649 participants) investigating four types of medicine: melatonin (five trials), trazodone (one trial), ramelteon (one trial), and orexin antagonists (two trials). Participants in all the trials had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The ramelteon trial, one melatonin trial, and both orexin antagonist trials were commercially funded. Overall, the evidence was moderate or low quality, meaning that further research is likely to affect the results.
Participants in the trazodone trial and most of those in the melatonin trials had moderate-to-severe dementia, while those in the ramelteon and orexin antagonist trials had mild-to-moderate dementia.
The five melatonin trials included 253 participants. We found no evidence that melatonin improved sleep in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The ramelteon trial had 74 participants. The limited information available did not provide any evidence that ramelteon was better than placebo. There were no serious harms for either medicine.
The trazodone trial had only 30 participants. It showed that a low dose of the sedative antidepressant trazodone, 50 mg, given at night for two weeks, may increase the total time spent asleep each night (an average of 43 minutes more in the trial) and may improve sleep efficiency (the percentage of time in bed spent sleeping). It may have slightly reduced the time spent awake at night after first falling asleep, but we could not be sure of this effect. It did not reduce the number of times the participants woke up at night. There were no serious harms reported.
The two orexin antagonist trials had 323 participants. We found evidence that an orexin antagonist probably has some beneficial effects on sleep. On average, participants in the trials slept 28 minutes longer at night and spent 15 minutes less time awake after first falling asleep. There was also a small increase in sleep efficiency, but no evidence of an effect on the number of times participants woke up. Side effects were no more common in participants taking the drugs than in those taking placebo.
The drugs that appeared to have beneficial effects on sleep did not seem to worsen participants' thinking skills, but these trials did not assess participants' quality of life, or look in any detail at outcomes for carers. Although we searched for them, we were unable to find any trials of other sleeping medications that are commonly prescribed to people with dementia. All participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, although sleep problems are also common in other forms of dementia. No trials assessed how long participants spent asleep without interruption, a high priority outcome to our panel of carers. Only four trials measured side effects systematically.
We concluded that there are significant gaps in the evidence needed to guide decisions about medicines for sleeping problems in dementia. More trials are required to inform medical practice. It is essential that trials include careful assessment of side effects.
 .The average duration of treatment was five years. Medicine classes studied in most people included medicines called thiazide diuretics or beta-blockers. Treatment may have little or no effect on death from any cause compared with placebo or no treatment (2.4% with placebo/no treatment versus 2.3% with treatment; low quality evidence) and it may reduce the number of people experiencing heart disease or death from heart disease from 4.1% to 3.2% (low quality evidence). It may reduce stroke by a small amount from 1.3% to 0.6% (low quality evidence). We are not certain about the effects of treatment on the number of people who had blocked arteries (low quality evidence). Withdrawal due to side effects increased from 0.7% to 3.0% although the quality of evidence for this result was very low. The effects of treatment on blood pressure varied between the studies and we are uncertain as to how much of a difference treatment makes on average. Antihypertensive medicines for adults aged 18 to 59 years with raised blood pressure have a small beneficial effect to reduce stroke. However, death due to all-causes and heart attack were not reduced and withdrawals due to side effects were increased. The overall evidence was graded as low or very low quality.
We included eight studies with a total of 353 boys and girls, who ranged in age from 1 month to 13 years. These studies had been published up to June 2015. Three studies compared nerve block with sham block. Three studies compared nerve block with injected analgesics, and two studies compared nerve block with local anaesthesia. The children who received the infraorbital nerve block (with lignocaine or bupivacaine) had less pain and more time between finishing surgery and needing more analgesics. These children also had less need for analgesics than those who received the sham block. The children who received the infraorbital nerve block also had less pain and were able to eat sooner than those who received injected (intravenous) analgesics. The nerve block did not appear to alter heart rate, breath rate, and blood pressure. Five out of eight studies found no unwanted side effects after the nerve blocks; the other three studies did not mention side effects. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low due to the small number of children included in the studies and differences between the studies (heterogeneity) regarding the types of intervention, the observation time, and the forms of measuring and describing the outcomes. Further studies with larger numbers of children are needed.
Other Cochrane reviews show benefit from nerve decompression surgery and steroids. This review of other non-surgical treatments found some evidence of short-term benefit from oral steroids, splinting/hand braces, ultrasound, yoga and carpal bone mobilisation (movement of the bones and tissues in the wrist), and insulin and steroid injections for people who also had diabetes. Evidence on ergonomic keyboards and vitamin B6 is unclear, while trials so far have not shown benefit from diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnets, laser acupuncture, exercise or chiropractic.
Atrial fibrillation after heart surgery is a common complication that has been associated with poor outcomes. We reviewed the literature to better understand the role of preventative interventions for this condition. By combining the results of 118 studies with 17,364 participants, we are able to gain a better understanding of the evidence behind each of these interventions. All of the interventions studied were effective in reducing the occurrence of atrial fibrillation, length of hospital stay, cost of hospital treatment and may be effective in reducing the risk of stroke. The interventions did not have an effect on death after heart surgery. It was not possible to analyze the adverse events associated with the medications studied in this review, but these should be considered by clinicians when choosing an appropriate intervention for their patients. Furthermore, differences in the design between the studies combined in this review may complicate interpretation of these results.
We found four studies with 1029 participants. All four studies compared participants taking tapentadol to participants taking similar medicine, such as morphine or oxycodone. All studies gave participants a period of time to find the best dose to take, before continuing on the medication and comparing their pain levels.
All the studies were small or medium sized, so the results are at risk of being influenced by random fluctuations rather than real differences, and they may also overestimate any effects. One trial allowed participants to know what medication they were taking, and one trial was stopped early due administrative problems, so they did not have enough people in the study. We have to be cautious interpreting results from these studies.
Because the studies all used different designs, we could not compare the results from one with another. However, each study showed that there was not much difference between the pain levels of people taking tapentadol and people taking morphine and oxycodone. Pain levels were generally well controlled. The studies also showed there was no measurable difference in how many adverse effects people had while taking tapentadol, morphine, or oxycodone.
Therefore, we can conclude only that the studies to date show tapentadol was no more or less effective and no more or less well tolerated than morphine and oxycodone.
The review of trials found that dual chamber pacemakers tended to prevent more subsequent heart problems than single chamber ventricular pacemakers. The impact on people's overall quality of life is uncertain. The review did not investigate the relative benefits or risks of surgery to upgrade to a dual chamber pacemaker.
All eligible randomised clinical trials comparing any antibiotic regimen versus placebo, versus no intervention or versus another antibiotic regimen for surgical site infection in patients who underwent liver transplantation, regardless of age, sex and reason for transplantation. Quasi-randomised studies and other observational studies were considered for data on harm if retrieved with the search result for randomised clinical trials.
Evidence is current to September 2015. Only one randomised clinical trial published in abstract form examined the effects of antibiotics for prophylaxis in liver transplant recipients. This randomised clinical trial, which was conducted at Shiraz Transplant Centre, Shiraz, Iran, randomly assigned a total of 180 participants; of these, 163 participants met the inclusion criteria after randomisation. The trial reported no other numerical data and was considered at high risk of bias; the quality of the evidence was low, hence we cannot be sure of the conclusions presented by trial authors. This trial assessed ceftriaxone plus metronidazole versus ampicillin-sulbactam plus ceftizoxime. Trial authors have not responded to three email requests sent by review authors to request detailed information, but they mention that they found no differences between the two antibiotic regimens when used for prophylaxis for bacterial infection among liver transplant recipients. The only identified trial, which was published in abstract form, is at high risk of bias. Trial authors did not report on outcomes such as adverse events, time of graft survival, intensive care unit stay, total time of hospital stay nor quality of life. Although study authors seemed to report on some outcomes of interest, their reporting is ambiguous, and no data are available. Trial authors excluded high-risk patients from their analyses. This review provides no evidence on benefits and harms of antibiotics for prophylaxis of surgical site infection among liver transplant recipients. Well-conducted randomised clinical trials adhering to SPIRIT and CONSORT guidelines are needed to determine the effects of antibiotics in the algorithm for prevention of surgical site infection among patients undergoing liver transplantation.
We wanted to assess the impact of dance movement therapy on different aspects of a person's life in comparison to no treatment, standard care or any other treatment. The main outcomes we were interested in were overall problems with behaviour and mental well-being, cognition (thinking and remembering), depression and quality of life. We also wanted to compare different forms of dance movement therapy. We searched the literature carefully for studies which compared a group of people with dementia who had dance movement therapy with another group of people with dementia (the control group). For the comparison to be fair, the assignment of a person to a particular group had to be decided randomly. We found only one study to include in our review. The study took place in Hong Kong and involved 204 people. Some of them had mild dementia and some had even milder problems with thinking and memory. In this study, the researchers compared dance movement therapy with exercise and with a waiting list. They compared the groups at the end of the therapy and then again three and nine months later. We did not find any difference between dance movement therapy and either exercise or waiting list for overall behaviour and mental well-being or for cognition. For depression, we found that there may be a small beneficial effect of dance movement therapy compared with exercise or waiting list, and this effect was still present three and nine months after the end of the therapy. However, we are not sure whether or not the effect was large enough to be really noticeable to the people with dementia. The study did not measure the participants' quality of life. There was only one study, so the amount of evidence was small. The study was well-conducted, but not all the participants had dementia (some had milder problems) and we do not know how well the results apply only to people with dementia. For these reasons, we are not certain if dance movement therapy is effective in supporting people with mild dementia and we cannot say anything about its effects in moderate or severe dementia. More studies are needed to be able to say for certain if dance movement therapy is beneficial for people with dementia of any severity. The last search was on 8 December 2022.
This review included one trial conducted in Brazil which randomised 25 eyes. The trial compared needling using a 27-gauge needle to medical treatment with aqueous suppressants and digital massage. Outcome measures in the trial were mean intraocular pressure and successful intraocular pressure control (defined arbitrarily as IOP less than 20 mmHg). This review found no conclusive evidence that needling of encapsulated blebs results in better intra-ocular pressure control than antiglaucoma medication.
This review has tried to do that by examining research about family-centred care. We looked for randomised trials of family-centred care interventions for children aged 0-12 years, in hospitals. We assessed potentially-relevant studies against criteria that identify important parts of family-centred care. Despite extensive searching we identified only one moderate-quality study (Bolton 2004) for inclusion. This study, from a doctoral thesis, showed that the family-centred care model had a positive effect on the adequacy of children's care, parental satisfaction, and costs. For other indicators such as clinical outcomes and children's behaviour there was no significant difference between the family-centred care model and standard inpatient care. There were no harms reported.
In this searches for this update, we also found 25 qualitative studies which described aspects of family-centred care, and a review of these will be published by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Our main conclusion from this Cochrane review update, however, is that further, rigorous research is needed to assess the effects of family-centred care on children's experience of hospitalisation, as well as on their parents, hospital staff, and service delivery outcomes such as costs.
This review of randomised controlled trials found no significant difference in the number of asthma attacks of moderate severity between people taking inhaled corticosteroids every day and those taking them 'as needed'. However, there was not enough information to conclude to that the two approaches were equivalent. We found that people taking inhaled corticosteroids everyday had slightly better asthma control with better lung function, less use of reliever medication and more symptom-free days than those taking inhaled corticosteroids intermittently. We also observed that compared to intermittent inhaled corticosteroids, children grew slightly less with daily inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone (inhaled corticosteroids are known to affect growth), underlying the importance of using the safest and lowest effective dose of inhaled corticosteroids. We did not observe any significant group difference in the rate of withdrawals or adverse effects. These results do not provide firm conclusions, although the improvement in asthma control, lung function and airway inflammation would provide slightly greater support for the use of inhaled corticosteroids every day as compared to taking them only when symptoms get worse. Physicians and patients are advised to weigh the risks and benefits of each treatment option carefully and monitor the response of individual patients to adjust therapy as needed.
Only randomised controlled trials were included in this review. In these studies,a group of participants were given physiotherapy intervention and were compared with another group of participants, who did not receive physiotherapy. Participants were assigned to a group in random fashion so a fair test was established. Thirty-nine randomised trials involving 1827 participants were identified as suitable for this review. The quality of the trials was not high because in many, methods were not reported adequately and blinding was not feasible. These trials assessed various physiotherapy interventions, so the trials were grouped according to the type of intervention being used (i.e. general physiotherapy, exercise, treadmill training, cueing, dance, or martial arts).
Improvement in all walking outcomes (except the 10- or 20-metre walk test) was noted with physiotherapy intervention. However, these improvements were significant only for walking speed, walking endurance, and freezing of gait. Mobility and balance also improved with a physiotherapy intervention, with significant improvements reported in one test of mobility (the Timed Up & Go test, which times how long it takes a person to get up from a chair, walk a certain distance, then walk back to the chair and sit down) and in two tests of balance (one assessing how far a person can reach before he or she loses balance (Functional Reach Test) and another assessing multiple aspects of balance (Berg Balance Scale)). Clinician-rated disability, using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), was also improved with physiotherapy intervention. No difference was observed between the two groups in falls or patient-rated quality of life. One study reported that adverse events were rare; no other studies reported data on this outcome. When the different physiotherapy interventions were compared, no evidence suggested that treatment effect differed across the physiotherapy interventions for any of the outcomes assessed.
This review provides evidence of the short-term benefit of physiotherapy for the treatment of PD. Although most observed differences were small, improvements in walking speed, balance with the Berg Balance Scale, and clinician-rated disability using the UPDRS were of a size that patients may consider them to be important. These benefits should be interpreted with caution because of the quality of the included trials, and the lack of common assessment of treatment effects. This affected the quantity of data that we could use for analysis.
This review aimed to assess the effects of physical exercise for pregnant women in preventing glucose intolerance or GDM and was based on limited evidence from five randomised controlled trials. Two trials involved obese women. The trials provided data from 922 women and their babies and were of moderate risk of bias. The exercise programs including individualised exercise with regular advice, weekly supervised group exercise session or home-based stationary cycling, either supervised or unsupervised, had no clear effect on preventing GDM (three trials with 826 women screened at 18 to 36 weeks' gestation), or improving insulin sensitivity (five trials) compared with standard antenatal care with normal daily activities. Based on these limited data, conclusive evidence is not available to guide practice. Larger, well-designed randomised trials are needed. Several such trials are in progress. We identified another seven trials which are ongoing and we will consider these for inclusion in the next update.
We searched the literature on January 13, 2016. We identified five randomised controlled trials with a total of 1,726 patients comparing the combination of IRI and fluoropyrimidine with IRI alone. The search in January 2016 resulted in an additional ongoing trial, the results of which have not been incorporated in this review.
This review compared IRI and fluoropyrimidine with IRI alone in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival, toxicity, response rates and quality of life. There is no evidence to suggest any superiority of the combination of IRI and fluoropyrimidine over IRI alone, but our results on overall survival are limited by the number of studies available to date. Longer progression-free survival was seen from adding fluoropyrimidines to IRI. Based on current evidence, both the combination regimens and IRI alone seem equally effective for treating advanced or metastatic patients. Patients in the intervention arm were less likely to develop grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and grade 1 or 2 alopecia, and more likely to have grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, compared to patients receiving IRI alone. There was moderate quality evidence from these studies suggesting longer progression-free survival from adding fluoropyrimidines to IRI. However, findings need to be confirmed by larger, high-quality randomised clinical trials.
We searched for evidence of benefits and harms of HRT in EOC, up to June 2019. We identified three studies involving a total of 350 women. We found that HRT may improve overall survival and may make little or no difference to progression-free survival. We are unsure about the effects on quality of life, incidence of breast cancer, transient ischaemic attack (also known as 'mini stroke'), cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and myocardial infarction (heart attack), as the certainty of the evidence was very low. There were no reports on the incidence of gallstones. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low for all outcomes, mainly due to the small number of participants and low numbers of adverse events reported. The certainty of the evidence is also reduced due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, meaning their results might overestimate or underestimate the true effect of the treatment. Hormone replacement therapy may improve the overall survival in women who are experiencing surgically induced menopause after treatment for EOC, but it may make little or no difference to survival without the disease getting worse. The overall certainty of these findings is low to very low, mainly due to a lack of information. This is a very important area for further research, which has the potential to make a big impact on many women.
We searched for evidence (June 2017) and included 15 studies in the review. The studies had a mixed risk of bias and were of limited quality, often with small numbers of participants. Three studies compared antibiotics (erythromycin, clindamycin, and amoxicillin) with placebo. The other studies compared different antibiotics with each other.
All of the studies reported on curing chlamydia, based on the elimination of the bacteria, with an antibiotic. Erythromycin (moderate-quality evidence from two studies, 495 women) and clindamycin (low-quality evidence from one study, 85 women) appeared to be more effective than placebo. The quality of the evidence for amoxicillin versus placebo (one study 15 women) was very low so we cannot be certain of the results.
When comparing different antibiotics with each other, no one antibiotic was substantially better than another at curing chlamydia in the studies that we examined: amoxicillin versus azithromycin (very low-quality evidence from two studies, 144 women), amoxicillin versus erythromycin (high-quality evidence from four studies, 466 women), azithromycin versus erythromycin (moderate-quality evidence from six studies, 374 women), clindamycin versus erythromycin (low-quality evidence from two studies, 173 women), amoxicillin versus clindamycin (moderate-quality evidence from one study, 101 women). Only single trials assessed repeated infections, preterm birth, preterm rupture of membranes, perinatal mortality and low birthweight and found there were no clear differences between the different types of antibiotics examined.
Side effects were more common with erythromycin (two studies, 495 women) and clindamycin (one study, 85 women) than with placebo. Amoxicillin resulted in fewer side effects than azithromycin (one study, 36 women) or erythromycin (four studies, 513 women), and azithromycin caused fewer side effects than erythromycin (six studies, 374 women). Amoxicillin and clindamycin produced a similar number of side effects in one study (107 women). Treatment of chlamydia infection with antibiotics appears to be effective during pregnancy. There is no clear difference between amoxicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, azithromycin in curing the infection or preterm birth, preterm rupture of membranes, and low birthweight. Azithromycin and clindamycin appear to result in fewer side effects than erythromycin.
The included studies were all carried out in North America. Chlamydia testing remains a problem in low-resource settings because of its costs. We conclude that well-designed studies of appropriate sample size, in different settings, are needed to further assess the effects of treatment of chlamydia infection in pregnancy. Resistance to the tested antibiotics could have changed since the studies included in this review were conducted. In particular, future research could report on the outcomes of focus in this review and target those antibiotics, such as amoxicillin and clindamycin, which may be effective in curing chlamydia with the least side effects.
We identified 104 studies of phosphate binders that included 13,744 people. Some studies gave treatment for only eight weeks while some studies treated participants for three years. People in the studies had a range of kidney function, and many were on dialysis. Overall we could not be certain of a number of important outcomes because many of the clinical studies we included had important flaws in their design.
Sevelamer treatment may have decreased death for those patients given this medication when taken instead of calcium. The phosphate binders probably caused constipation, but we could not be very certain about the risks of other side-effects. We were not very certain whether phosphate binders reduced heart complications, stroke, bone pain, or calcification of blood vessels. Overall, we are not very sure whether specific phosphate binders are beneficial to patients with CKD. There is a possibility that sevelamer may prevent death compared to calcium-based binders, but we don't know whether this may be caused by an increased risk of calcium-based binders, a lower risk with sevelamer treatment, or the possibility that both may be true. Patients need to know that it is not certain whether phosphate binders help to prevent complications of kidney disease, but sevelamer may be preferred to calcium binders.
We did not find differences in the effects of treatment for patients on dialysis and those not on dialysis, although most studies evaluating treatment with calcium-based binders were among dialysis patients and those comparing binders with placebo were among people not treated with dialysis.
Searches for randomised trials were run in 2010 and 2012, review authors found 22 relevant trials that randomised a total of 2041 people with schizophrenia. The trials compared the effects of taking a variety of antioxidants (allopurinol, Ginkgo biloba , N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), selegiline, vitamins C and E) compared with placebo. Most results showed no real differences between the antioxidants and placebo although there was evidence Ginkgo biloba had a positive effect on psychotic symptoms in the short term. The quality of this evidence was moderate.
However, overall, the trials suffered from a lack of real-world outcomes, such as clinical response, rates of relapse, quality of life, functioning, safety and satisfaction or acceptability of treatment. Adverse effects were also poorly reported with some studies not providing any data for adverse effects.
Ginkgo biloba and NAC emerged from the trials as the most promising, so should have priority in the design of future trials that are larger, longer and better reported than the 22 studies available at the present time.

The evidence is current to August 2019. We found one trial suitable to answer our question, which compared giving a patient two drugs into a vein in (diazepam and glucagon) to placebos (clear liquids which appeared similar to the drugs but have no effect on the body). We did not look at treating sharp or hard objects, as these are treated differently. There was not enough evidence to say with certainty which treatments for food impacted in the oesophagus are safe or effective. We graded the overall certainty of the evidence as low. More studies with more participants are needed to be able to answer the review question.
We included nine randomised controlled trials.The review demonstrated that in women who are not freely drinking fluids during the course of their labour, additional fluids through a 'drip' (intravenously) reduces the duration of their labour. The number of caesarean sections was also reduced when women received normal saline or Ringer’s lactate at a rate of 250 mL/hour compared to 125 mL/hour. Dextrose-containing fluids reduced the sodium levels (hyponatraemia) of both the labouring mother and their newborns.
However, the differences in the methodology and quality of several of the trials do not provide sufficient evidence to recommend routinely attaching labouring women to a drip. Further research needs to be undertaken as to whether or not women who are freely drinking, even need to have a drip, and the policy of restricted oral intake needs to be urgently reviewed.
