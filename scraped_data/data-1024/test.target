In June 2015 we searched for as many relevant studies that had a robust design (randomised controlled trials) as we could find and compared different types of hand antisepsis before surgery. We included 14 studies that compared a range of methods for performing surgical hand antisepsis. The two measures used to assess the effectiveness of treatments were the number of cases of SSIs in patients (presented in four included studies) and the number of viable bacteria or fungal cells (known as colony-forming units, or CFUs) on the hand of the person operating before surgery and after surgery (which is a way of counting the bacteria present on the skin surface). It is not clear whether the method of hand antisepsis influences the risk of SSI, as most of the studies were too small and had flaws. There was some evidence that hand antisepsis with chlorhexidine may reduce the number of bacteria on the hands of health professionals compared with povidone iodine. Importantly, we do not know what the number of CFUs on the hands tells us about the likelihood of patients developing SSIs. There was also some evidence that alcohol rubs with additional antiseptic ingredients may reduce CFUs compared with aqueous scrubs.
Up-to-date June 2015
The review found some evidence that glycerol improves the short term survival after stroke, but there was not enough evidence to decide whether glycerol helps avoid disability after stroke. Adverse effects of glycerol treatment did not happen often, but a small number of treated patients were found to have blood in their urine (this disappeared after the glycerol treatment was stopped). More research is needed.
We wanted to know whether giving antibiotics as a preventive measure reduces infection and other complications after tooth extraction. We also wanted to understand whether antibiotics work differently in healthy people compared with people with health conditions such as diabetes or HIV. We searched for studies that assessed the effectiveness of antibiotics compared to placebo (sham medicine), given when no infection was present in order to prevent infection following tooth extraction. Studies could include people of any age undergoing tooth extraction.
Where possible, we pooled the studies’ results and analysed them together. We also assessed the quality of each study to judge the reliability (certainty) of evidence of individual studies and the body of evidence. We found 23 included studies with a total of more than 3200 participants, who received either antibiotics (of different kinds and dosages) or placebo immediately before or just after tooth extraction, or both.
Four studies were conducted in Spain, three each in Brazil, Sweden, and the UK, two in India, and one each in Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Poland, New Zealand, Nigeria, and the USA. All but one study included healthy patients in their 20s. Twenty-one studies assessed the removal of wisdom teeth in hospital dental departments, one assessed the removal of other teeth and one assessed complex oral surgery. None of the included studies assessed tooth extraction in general dental practice for the removal of decayed teeth. Antibiotics given just before or just after surgery (or both) may reduce the risk of infection and dry socket after the removal of wisdom teeth by oral surgeons. However, antibiotics may cause more (generally brief and minor) unwanted effects for these patients. We found no evidence that antibiotics prevent pain, fever, swelling, or problems with restricted mouth opening in patients who have had wisdom teeth removed.
There was no evidence to judge the effects of preventive antibiotics for extractions of severely decayed teeth, teeth in diseased gums, or extractions in patients who are sick or have low immunity to infection. Our confidence in the results is limited because we had concerns about aspects of the design and reporting of all of the included studies. We did not find studies in patients with depressed immune systems, other illnesses, or in young children or older patients, therefore the results of our review probably do not apply to people who may be at high risk of infection. Also, extractions were mainly carried out by oral surgeons, so the review may not apply to dentists working in general practice.
Another concern, which cannot be assessed by clinical studies (i.e. studies testing new medical approaches in people), is that widespread use of antibiotics by people who do not have an infection is likely to contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance.
We concluded that antibiotics given to healthy people when they are having teeth extracted may help prevent infection, but the decision to use an antibiotic should be judged on an individual patient basis based on their state of health and possible complications of getting an infection. This is an updated review. The evidence is current to April 2020.
These scopes allow the intubator to see the airway via a camera, but no reviews have examined the use of an FIS in this situation. Intubation with an FIS is considered an advanced method, requiring training and experience; therefore it may be underused in clinical practice. We aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness of an FIS used for tracheal intubation in obese patients with direct laryngoscopy and other intubation methods that give the intubator an indirect view of the larynx. These other methods include videolaryngoscopes (VLSs)—metal laryngoscopes that contain a camera. We found three small studies, with a total of 131 patients, that compared an FIS with a VLS. The results for all patient safety outcomes were inconclusive, and no differences were noted between intubation with a flexible scope and intubation with a videolaryngoscope. We are unable to make any recommendations for practice based on this review. More research is needed to identify the technique for intubating obese people that would offer the best success rate with the fewest complications.
This review found four small studies that evaluated the effect of steroids on low blood pressure in premature infants. At present, there is insufficient information on which to base recommendations about the value of giving steroids to babies born before term who have low blood pressure.
This review found three studies involving 351 participants evaluating the effectiveness of different antibiotic therapies in adults with acute laryngitis. The evidence is current to December 2014. We ranked the quality of the evidence as low to very low, mainly because many studies had methodological limitations, outcome results were based on limited numbers of trials and the trials included participants that could not be pooled. We found that penicillin V and erythromycin appear to have no benefit in treating acute laryngitis. Erythromycin could reduce voice disturbance at one week and cough at two weeks when measured subjectively. Fusafungine could improve the rates of cured patients at day five. Overall, there is no clear benefit for the primary outcome, which is an objective assessment of voice quality, but some improvements are seen in subjective measures (i.e. cough, hoarseness of voice) that could be important to patients. However, we consider that these modest benefits from antibiotics may not outweigh their cost, adverse effects or negative consequences for antibiotic resistance patterns. The implications for practice are that prescribing antibiotics should not be done in the first instance as they will not objectively improve symptoms
Three randomised controlled trials, involving 212 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review. The evidence available does not demonstrate that FESS, as practised in the included trials, is superior to medical treatment with or without sinus irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. There were no major complications in any of the included trials and FESS appears to be a safe procedure. More randomised controlled trials comparing FESS with medical and other treatments, with long-term follow up, are required.
Our systematic search identified 12 studies enrolling 933 people with MS. Research shows that vitamin D has no effect on recurrence of relapse, worsening of disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or new MRI gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions. Its effects on health-related quality of life and fatigue are unclear. Our confidence in these results is very low because vitamin D has been evaluated in only a few small trials that we judged as having high risk of bias. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe for people with MS included in our review, but available data are limited. For people with MS, vitamin D supplementation appears to have no effect on relevant clinical outcomes or new MRI lesions. Vitamin D supplementation at the doses and treatment durations used in the included trials appears to be safe, although available data are limited. Seven trials are ongoing; they will likely provide further evidence for a future update of this review. This evidence is up-to-date as of October 2017.
We wanted to know whether any type of statin has benefits for women with PCOS who are not actively trying to get pregnant. We were interested in the effect of statins on:
1. increasing the regularity of menstrual cycles and ovulation; and
2. reducing hair excess, acne, and testosterone levels.
We also wanted to know if statins have any unwanted effects. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. We searched for studies that evaluated statins compared with placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, or another medicine, in women with PCOS who were not trying to get pregnant. We were only interested in studies that allocated each woman to one or another treatment at random. This type of study usually provides the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included six studies that enrolled a total of 396 women. Four studies were conducted in Europe (265 women), one in the USA (20 women), and one in Iran (111 women). Pharmaceutical companies funded three studies. We are uncertain if statins compared with placebo, or statins plus metformin compared with metformin alone, improve the regularity of menstrual periods. No studies reported resumption of ovulation. We are uncertain if statins improve hirsutism, acne, or testosterone levels. All the studies that recorded unwanted effects found no clear differences in unwanted effects between the group of women taking statins and the other treatment group. We included very few studies, most of which enrolled few women, and the results were very inconsistent across studies. For these reasons, we have very little confidence in the evidence. The evidence is current up to 7 November 2022.
We found 36 randomized controlled trials comparing rLH combined with rFSH versus rFSH alone among 8125 women undergoing IVF/ICSI. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review, first published in 2007. The evidence is current to June 2016. Only seven of the 36 studies clearly stated that they were funded by government or research institutes. Six were funded by pharmaceutical companies and the rest did not state their source of funding. We found no clear evidence of a difference between rLH combined with rFSH and rFSH alone in rates of live birth or OHSS. The evidence for these comparisons was of very low-quality for live birth and low quality for OHSS. We found moderate quality evidence that the use of rLH combined with rFSH may lead to more ongoing pregnancies than rFSH alone. There was also moderate-quality evidence suggesting little or no difference between the groups in rates of miscarriage. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of cancellation due to low response or imminent OHSS, but the evidence for these outcomes was of low or very low quality.
We conclude that the evidence is too limited to encourage or discourage stimulation regimens that include rLH combined with rFSH in IVF/ICSI cycles. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of methods) and imprecision.
For the present review, researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effects of valproate (valproic acid or sodium valproate or a combination of the two) in adult patients (≥ 16 years of age) with 'episodic' migraine (headache on < 15 days per month). They examined research published up to 15 January 2013 and found 10 relevant studies. Compared with placebo, valproate reduced the frequency of migraine headaches by approximately four per month (two studies, 63 participants). Patients were also more than twice as likely to reduce the number of their migraine headaches by 50% or more with valproate than with placebo (five studies, 576 participants). Side effects associated with valproate were common but generally mild; valproate can, however, cause birth defects and so should be used with caution in women of childbearing age. Further research is needed comparing valproate with other active drugs used for preventing migraine attacks.
On 26 November 2013 we performed searches to look for clinical trials where lamotrigine was used to treat neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. We found 12 studies of reasonable quality that tested lamotrigine against placebo for a number of weeks. Almost half of the 1511 people in the studies had painful limbs because of damaged nerves caused by diabetes, and seven different painful neuropathic conditions were examined. No studies looked at fibromyalgia.
Lamotrigine did not help the pain, and was no different from placebo except in causing more side effects. Adverse events were more frequent with lamotrigine than placebo, with rash in 1 person in 27.
This review looks at whether family therapy can help children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) without medication. There are several medications and types of therapy used to treat ADHD. However, many families would rather that their children not take medication. Two studies met the criteria for quality of research method. One found no difference in children's symptoms of ADHD after either family therapy or normal treatment in the community. The second study found that family therapy was more effective than a medication placebo. Further research is needed.
The review looked for studies that examined the effectiveness of this treatment in improving movement and reducing the death rate. Nearly all the research, seven trials, has involved just one steroid, methylprednisolone. The results show that treatment with this steroid does improve movement but it must start soon after the injury has happened, within no more than eight hours. It should be continued for 24 to 48 hours. Different dose rates of the drug have been given and the so-called high-dose rate is the most effective. The treatment does not, however, give back the patient a normal amount of movement and more research is necessary with steroids, possibly combining them with other drugs.
13 trials with a total of 9961 participants were included in this review. Ten trials with a total of 8562 participants involved an indacaterol versus placebo comparison. Five trials with a total of 4133 participants involved an indacaterol versus twice-daily beta2-agonist comparison. Two trials included both indacaterol versus placebo and indacaterol versus twice-daily beta2-agonist comparisons. Trials were between 12 and 52 weeks duration and compared doses between 75 mcg and 600 mcg. In most trials, mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was approximately 50% predicted. 1. Indacaterol is an effective medication for the treatment of patients with stable COPD. It results in improved lung function and quality of life.
2. Indacaterol led to improvements in lung function that were clinically similar to those seen with twice-daily long-acting beta2-agonists.
3. No measurable difference was noted between indacaterol and twice-daily long-acting beta2-agonists with respect to quality of life, but important differences cannot be excluded.
4. No significant difference was observed in the number of participants suffering a serious adverse event or mortality, but the confidence intervals were too wide because very few events could be used to rule out important differences. Overall the quality of the evidence was judged to be high. Indacaterol is an effective treatment for patients with stable COPD; it offers benefits that are clinically similar to those of existing twice-daily preparations within the same class of medication but provides the possible advantage of once-daily dosing.
We found 56 trials (involving a total of 3781 women, all with stress urinary incontinence but some with urgency urinary incontinence as well) comparing electrical stimulation to no treatment or to any other available treatment. For cure or improvement of SUI, electrical stimulation was probably better than no active or sham treatment. There was not enough evidence to say whether it was any better than pelvic floor muscle training for curing or improving SUI, or for quality of life. Adding electrical stimulation to pelvic floor muscle training may not make much difference to cure or improvement of SUI. It is uncertain whether it offers any improvement in quality of life compared with pelvic floor muscle training.
We found that few women reported adverse effects with electrical stimulation, but there was not enough reliable evidence comparing electrical stimulation to other treatments to know more about its safety.
There was not enough evidence comparing electrical stimulation to other existing treatments such as drug therapy, pelvic floor muscle training plus vaginal cones, surgery, or different forms of electrical stimulation, to provide evidence-based guidance on which would be better, and for which women, in curing or improving SUI or in improving quality of life. There was no information from these studies to judge value for money. There is some evidence to support the use of electrical stimulation for stress urinary incontinence in women, but we are still very uncertain about the full potential of this treatment because of the low quality of the existing evidence. While we found evidence indicating that electrical stimulation may be better than no treatment, we did not find enough well-designed trials with enough women to fully answer our review questions, so we do not yet know if ES is better or worse than other treatments.
This review aimed to test whether any anticoagulant regimen offers net advantages over antiplatelet agents, overall, or in specific categories of patients. There was no evidence that anticoagulants are superior to antiplatelet agents (in fact, anticoagulants caused a small increase in the number of deaths at long-term follow-up). However, the combination of low-dose anticoagulant and aspirin seemed to offer benefits over aspirin alone, and the combination should be investigated further.
This review identified three randomised controlled trials in the area of psychological treatments for anxiety after TBI. Some evidence was found for the effectiveness of the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for treatment of acute stress disorder following mild TBI, and combining CBT and neurorehabilitation for treatment of general anxiety symptoms in people with mild to moderate TBI. The ability to make strong conclusions on the effectiveness of these approaches is limited by the small number of trials available for pooling of data, especially trials with similar conditions and participants.
We searched for studies up to January 2017. We found five studies, and they investigated 278 people. Most people included in the studies were women, who were around 50 years of age, and reported a mixture of chronic pain conditions (e.g. headache, back pain, muscle pain). The studies included acupuncture, mindfulness, and cognitive behavioral therapy as strategies to decrease the amount of opioids taken by adults with chronic pain. No conclusions can be drawn from this small amount of information. Therefore, it is not clear whether these treatments decrease the amount of opioids in adults with chronic pain (primary outcome) or reduce pain intensity, physical ability or mood (secondary outcomes). Three studies did include negative effects of their treatment, and two reported that the participants did not have anything negative happen to them because of the trial they were in. Non-randomised studies, not included in this review, do indicate that for many people intensive rehabilitation packages may bring about major reduction in opioid use. Reducing prescribed opioid use in chronic non-cancer pain is an important topic in need of more systematic research. We were not able to judge the quality of evidence included in this review because the studies were so different and could not be combined.
We searched for evidence on 15th August 2016 and identified a further 13 studies. The review now includes a total of 23 studies involving 4777 women. The five main primary outcomes (after the administration of NO donors) included: vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours; uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the fetal heart rate; caesarean section; serious neonatal morbidity/perinatal death; and serious maternal morbidity or death. The evidence for the five primary outcomes was mainly found to be of low quality. There was no evidence of a difference for any of the primary outcomes analysed. There was evidence from four trials to suggest that NO donors were superior to placebo in bringing on ripening of the cervix. Women who received NO donors were also more likely to experience side effects such as headache, nausea or vomiting. NO donor leads to little or no difference on the majority of labour process and delivery outcomes. However, there was some evidence to suggest that it probably helps in causing the cervix to be more favourable at 12 to 24 hours after administration. Additional studies are needed to see the true impact of NO donors in bringing on induction of labour and its effect on caesarean section rates.
The results of this review of randomized controlled trials indicate that botulinum toxin is effective for some aspects of voice production, including perceptual measures of improvement post-injection, variability of fundamental frequency, vocal intensity and subglottal air pressure. These benefits may be dependent on certain subject variables, such as the amount of voice use immediately post-injection and treatment variables such as dosage and location of injection. These results should currently be interpreted with caution, however, as studies have used small sample sizes and have methodological differences which prevent between-study comparisons.
The authors of this review searched for all randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists in traumatically brain injured patients. The authors found four trials involving 406 patients. Whilst the overall effect estimates suggest that bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists may reduce mortality and disability, they also suggest that they may increase the number of serious adverse events. However, all of these results are consistent with the play of chance. The findings indicate that there is no evidence to support the use of bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists for TBI.
Bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists are not presently registered for use in patients. Because the safety and effectiveness of bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists have not been reliably ascertained, they should not be used outside the context of well conducted trials.
The evidence is current to November 2013. We included six studies involving 126 participants who completed the study protocols. Most studies recruited participants with severe to very severe COPD. The average age of participants ranged from 63 to 71 years. Cycling or treadmill exercise training was performed in the studies. The duration of exercise training programmes ranged from six to twelve weeks. The percentage change in peak exercise capacity increased by an average of 17% in three studies, and the percentage change in endurance exercise capacity by an average of 59% in two studies that provided NIV during training compared with training without NIV or training with sham NIV. However, these improvements in exercise capacity were not consistent findings as there was no clear evidence that NIV improved all other measures of exercise capacity. The results for quality of life were uncertain and our analysis did not exclude there being an effect with NIV during exercise training in two studies. Physical activity was not assessed in any of the studies. Non-invasive ventilation allowed participants to exercise at a higher training intensity (average of 13% higher) in three studies, and evidence of a greater training effect on the muscles was found in two studies, as a marker in the blood (isoload blood lactate) was significantly lower by an average of 0.97 mmol/L. No information regarding adverse events or cost was reported. It is currently unknown whether demonstrated benefits of NIV during exercise training are clinically worthwhile or cost-effective. This review was generally limited by the small number of included studies and the small numbers of participants within the included studies. The quality of the evidence was low for exercise capacity outcomes, largely because of issues with study design. Consequently, the effect of NIV during exercise training on exercise capacity is uncertain. The quality of the evidence for quality of life, training intensity and isoload blood lactate was moderate, and these findings can be interpreted with a greater degree of confidence.
We looked for studies involving adults with gliomas that compared current practice of doing scans at specific time points with other approaches. We found only one study meeting our criteria. This was from a cancer centre in the USA, looking at glioblastoma patients (those with the most aggressive gliomas) who had been treated between 2006 and 2016. The study involved 125 people and split them into those scanned within two days of surgery (early scan) with those who were not. They showed that doing the early scan made no change to the chance of being alive at one and two years after diagnosis. This might have been because the early scans were not used to change treatments, which mainly were to receive standard radiotherapy and temozolomide, and we could not tell if the patients' surgeon(s) were different or had different approaches to care. We judged this suggestion of little change in survival time with or without early scanning to be very uncertain. The number of people included over 10 years was small, and the decision whether or not to have a scan after surgery was based on surgeon's choice. It was not clear whether the surgeon(s) involved or their approaches to care differed, nor whether a person's care might have been changed in light of early imaging. The other search did not find any studies looking at the value of different imaging approaches. We still do not know whether doing scans regularly at specific times after glioma diagnosis changes how well patients do. The limited evidence, suggesting early scans after operations do not affect survival, is unreliable and more research is needed, especially as early scans may also help surgeons improve their practice, and decide whether to repeat the operation earlier than they might otherwise have chosen to do.
The best timings and reasons for scanning brain gliomas in adults are not known. Lessons might be learned from studies involving children, and by looking at large collections of clinical trials. It is also important to study the potential costs and benefits of different strategies.
Azathioprine is a drug that suppresses the immune system. This review includes three trials with a total of 81 patients. Forty patients were given azathioprine and forty-one were given placebo. Patients taking azathioprine had lower tender joint scores when compared to patients taking placebo. Significantly more patients in the azathioprine group withdrew from the studies due to adverse reactions compared to patients in the placebo group.
This evidence is based on a small number of patients in older trials. These findings suggest that several other drugs should be used before considering azathioprine for a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
We wanted to find out how well each vaccine works in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 disease with symptoms, severe COVID-19 disease, and total number of deaths (including any death, not only those related to COVID-19).
We wanted to find out about serious adverse events that might require hospitalization, be life-threatening, or both; systemic reactogenicity events (immediate short-term reactions to vaccines mainly due to immunological responses; e.g. fever, headache, body aches, fatigue); and any adverse events (which include non-serious adverse events). We searched for studies that examined any COVID-19 vaccine compared to placebo, no vaccine, or another COVID-19 vaccine.
We selected only randomized trials (a study design that provides the most robust evidence because they evaluate interventions under ideal conditions among participants assigned by chance to one of two or more groups). We compared and summarized the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as how the study was conducted. We found 41 worldwide studies involving 433,838 people assessing 12 different vaccines. Thirty-five studies included only healthy people who had never had COVID-19. Thirty-six studies included only adults, two only adolescents, two children and adolescents, and one included adolescents and adults. Three studied people with weakened immune systems, and none studied pregnant women.
Most cases assessed results less than six months after the primary vaccination. Most received co-funding from academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies. Most studies compared a COVID-19 vaccine with placebo. Five evaluated the addition of a 'mix and match' booster dose. We report below results for three main outcomes and for 10 World Health Organization (WHO)-approved vaccines (for the remaining outcomes and vaccines, see main text). There is insufficient evidence regarding deaths between vaccines and placebo (mainly because the number of deaths was low), except for the Janssen vaccine, which probably reduces the risk of all-cause deaths.
People with symptoms
The Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Bharat vaccines produce a large reduction in the number of people with symptomatic COVID-19.
The Janssen vaccine reduces the number of people with symptomatic COVID-19.
The Novavax vaccine probably has a large reduction in the number of people with symptomatic COVID-19.
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether CoronaVac vaccine affects the number of people with symptomatic COVID-19 because results differed between the two studies (one involved only healthcare workers with a higher risk of exposure).
Severe disease
The Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, and Bharat vaccines produce a large reduction in the number of people with severe disease.
There is insufficient evidence about CoronaVac vaccine on severe disease because results differed between the two studies (one involved only healthcare workers with a higher risk of exposure).
Serious adverse events
For the Pfizer, CoronaVac, Sinopharm-Beijing, and Novavax vaccines, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the vaccine and placebo mainly because the number of serious adverse events was low.
Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Bharat vaccines probably result in no or little difference in the number of serious adverse events. Most studies assessed the vaccine for a short time after injection, and it is unclear if and how vaccine protection wanes over time. Due to the exclusion criteria of COVID-19 vaccine trials, results cannot be generalized to pregnant women, people with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or people with weakened immune systems. More research is needed comparing vaccines and vaccine schedules, and effectiveness and safety in specific populations and outcomes (e.g. preventing long COVID-19). Further, most studies were conducted before the emergence of variants of concerns. The evidence is up to date to November 2021. This is a living systematic review. Our results are available and updated bi-weekly on the COVID-NMA platform at covid-nma.com.
This systematic review of randomized controlled trials assessed the effects of behavioral interventions on promoting condom use among women living with HIV, a population at higher risk to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Based on five eligible studies, we found that behavioral interventions promoting consistent condom use in HIV-positive women did not have a significant impact on outcomes, when compared to standard care or minimal HIV-related support. However, these findings should be used with caution since they are based on a few small trials that were targeted specifically towards HIV-positive women. New research is needed to assess the potential personal and public health gains that could arise from a combination of interventions that promote safe sexual behavior and adopt a harm reduction approach, particularly in developing countries, where HIV infection rates among women remain high.
We searched several medical databases and identified two randomised controlled trials (RCT) that met our inclusion criteria; no new trials were identified for this review update. One trial included 40 breast cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy. Eighteen patients received G-CSF and 22 got antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and amphotericin) to prevent infection. Another trial evaluated GM-CSF versus antibiotics in patients with small-cell lung cancer, with 78 patients in the GM-CSF arm and 77 patients in the antibiotics arm. The study that analysed G-CSF versus antibiotics did not report all cause mortality, microbiologically or clinically documented infections, severe infections, quality of life, or adverse events. We found no evidence of a difference between the two prophylactic options for the outcomes of infection-related mortality (no patient died because of infection), or febrile neutropenia.
The trial that assessed GM-CSF versus antibiotics did not found any evidence of a difference in all cause mortality, trial mortality, infections, or severe infections. The only difference between the two arms was found for the adverse event thrombocytopenia, favouring patients receiving antibiotics. Quality of life was not reported in this trial.
More research is needed to determine the best prevention against infection in cancer patients. The quality of the evidence for infection-related mortality and frequency of febrile neutropenia in the G-CSF trial was very low, because of the small number of patients that were evaluated, and the study design (high risk of bias). The trial that analysed GM-CSF versus antibiotics reported overall survival, toxic deaths, infections, severe infections, and adverse events. Because of the very small number of patients included, we judged that the overall quality for all these outcomes was low.
The evidence is current to December 2015.
We wanted to know if antibiotics reduce death, severity of disease, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, if they have an effect on quality of life or cause unwanted effects. We included studies that compared antibiotics to placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, usual care, another antibiotic, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as remdesivir or dexamethasone. We excluded treatments that we know do not work for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, or have an unknown influence on the disease.
We evaluated the effects of antibiotics on people with COVID-19 on:
• people dying;
• whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better or worse;
• unwanted effects;
• heart rhythm problems;
• quality of life. We searched for studies that investigated antibiotics to treat people with COVID-19 in hospital or as outpatients.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as study methods and sizes. We found 11 studies with 11,281 people that investigated antibiotics to treat COVID-19. All 11 studies investigated azithromycin. Nine studies (10,807 people) compared azithromycin to no treatment, placebo or usual care alone. Two studies compared azithromycin to another antibiotic: lincomycin (1 study, 24 people) and clarithromycin (1 study, 450 people), however, they did not report data that we could use in this review, so our results apply to azithromycin only.
Seven studies included people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in hospital and four studies included outpatients with mild COVID-19. The studies used different doses of azithromycin and different durations of treatment.
We found 19 ongoing studies. We have not classified 15 completed studies because we are waiting for more information from the authors, or they have not yet been published.  Azithromycin compared to usual care alone, does not lead to more or fewer deaths in the 28 days after treatment (4 studies, 8600 people).
Compared to usual care alone or placebo, azithromycin probably does not:
• worsen (1 study, 7311 people) or 
• improve patients’ condition (3 studies, 8172 people);
• increase or decrease serious unwanted events (4 studies, 794 people), and heart rhythm problems (4 studies, 7865 people).
Azithromycin may increase non-serious unwanted effects slightly compared to usual care alone (3 studies, 355 people).
No studies looked at quality of life. Compared to usual care alone or placebo azithromycin may make little or no difference to: 
• people dying in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people);
• whether the people's disease worsened in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people) or
• whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better in the 14 days after treatment (1 study, 138 people).
We don't know whether azithromycin compared to usual care alone or placebo increases or decreases serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 454 participants).
No studies reported non-serious unwanted events, heart rhythm problems, or quality of life. We are very confident in the evidence on azithromycin for COVID-19 inpatients. However, we are less confident in the evidence on azithromycin in outpatients, mainly because there were few studies that also had some flaws, therefore we could not draw reliable conclusions. We found relevant evidence on only one antibiotic, azithromycin, so we do not know the effects of other antibiotics for treating COVID-19. We will continue to search for new studies to fill this evidence gap. Our evidence does not suggest azithromycin is an effective treatment for COVID-19, especially given the danger of antimicrobial resistance. Azithromycin or any other antibiotic should not be used to treat COVID-19 outside well-designed studies. The evidence is up to date to 14 June 2021.
We analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non-specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months. We did not find any evidence that participating in CT was associated with increased burden for participants. However, we also found no evidence that CT was better than participating in other active treatments. The quality of the studies we reviewed varied but overall was not very high, so our certainty in some of these findings is low. Future studies should continue improving on quality, should continue comparing CT with other treatments, and should follow participants for a longer period to understand whether observed benefits for cognition last beyond the short or medium term.
This review of 12 randomised controlled trials involving 6822 mothers found that vibroacoustic stimulation improved the effectiveness of the baby's heart rate testing. However, the data on fetal distress and perinatal death were too few to draw any conclusions on safety. More research is needed to determine the optimal intensity, frequency, duration and position of the vibroacoustic stimulation and to evaluate the safety and perinatal outcomes when used with cardiotocography and other tests of fetal wellbeing.
This update found no new eligible trials. The original review found three trials investigating the effects of red blood cell transfusion in patients with upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. There were more deaths recorded in the transfusion arm of the combined studies compared to the control arm. It is by no means clear that transfusion is a surrogate marker for more severe haemorrhage. The deaths were too few and the trials too disparate to draw any firm conclusions regarding the effects of transfusion on mortality. We can only recommend that further, larger studies are done.
SPf66 has had 10 trials in Africa, Asia, and South America. Results were initially promising, but further trials showed only a small effect in some trials, and no effect in Africa. There is no evidence that SPf66 is effective enough to be introduced on a routine basis for prevention of malaria.
We found 18 studies including 1157 people with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis; most were adults. Twelve studies used a tablet form of antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, amoxycillin, clarithromycin, penicillin, oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin). The remaining six studies reported use of inhaled medications. Antibiotics were given for between four weeks and 83 weeks. In seven studies, similar disease severity at baseline was supported by the similar history of previous hospitalisation and severe attacks.
Overall quality of evidence was rated as moderate. When an outcome is rated as high quality, further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect, but moderate ratings reflect some uncertainty in the findings. Prolonged antibiotic therapy in bronchiectasis provides benefit, especially in reducing the risk of future exacerbations and hospitalisations. Antibiotics are well tolerated by participants without significant differences in overall adverse effects (e.g. intolerance, chest symptoms, fatigue, fever, palpitations).
However, antibiotic resistance is a matter of concern, particularly for patients with drug allergies, which further limit their future treatment.
The aim of the review was to determine the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy in relieving acute bronchiolitis in infants between 0 and 24 months old, as well as to determine the effectiveness of the different techniques of chest physiotherapy. We searched for all randomised controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing chest physiotherapy interventions against a control or other types of physiotherapy, and looked at their effectiveness by type of technique and bronchiolitis severity. We included 17 trials with a total of 1679 infants. Five trials (246 infants) tested vibration and percussion techniques (conventional chest physiotherapy); three trials (628 infants) tested forced expiratory techniques; and nine trials (805 infants) tested slow expiratory techniques. Two trials (80 infants) tested instrumental physiotherapy techniques, and three trials (216 infants) tested the rhinopharyngeal retrograde clearance technique (two combined with slow expiratory technique in 116 infants). Disease severity of infants was mild in one trial, severe in four trials, moderate in six trials, and a mix of mild to moderate in five trials. One trial did not report disease severity of infants. Two trials were performed in ambulatory (non-hospitalised) infants, and the rest were performed in hospitalised infants.
We found no effect of conventional physiotherapy on disease severity of infants with moderate bronchiolitis. Forced expiratory techniques also failed to show an effect on bronchiolitis severity in infants with severe disease, while important adverse effects were reported. We have high confidence in this evidence, and new trials are unlikely to challenge these results. Slow expiratory techniques showed a mild to moderate improvement in bronchiolitis severity, mostly in infants with moderate bronchiolitis, based on low-certainty evidence (future studies may challenge this result). Also, one study showed an improvement in time to recovery with slow expiratory techniques in infants with moderate bronchiolitis. No effects were shown or reported for other clinical outcomes such as length of hospital stay, duration of oxygen supplementation, use of bronchodilators, or parents' impression of a benefit from the physiotherapy. Despite the positive effects found for some types of chest physiotherapy, most of the trials were poorly designed, which has a direct impact on the certainty and reliability of the results. For some techniques, the evidence for the effect is of low certainty. Furthermore, a larger number of participants, longer interventions, and well-reported adverse events are needed before any firm conclusions can be reached.
The evidence is robust for the older or more established types of physiotherapy (vibration and percussion and forced expiratory techniques) administered to hospitalised infants. The evidence is limited for slow expiratory techniques, and only anecdotal for the newest techniques (rhinopharyngeal retrograde clearance and instrumental clearance techniques), which have been explored in few trials. There is little evidence on the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy in non-hospitalised infants. The evidence is current to 20 April 2022.
This review was not able to find sufficient good quality evidence from randomized trials to show whether this treatment does more good than harm. This therapy appears promising but further trials are needed to fully assess safety and efficacy.
Data from recent randomised trials of chemotherapy suggest an improvement in overall survival, pain relief, and quality of life with this form of therapy. Side effects are common and can be severe. Chemotherapy offers a treatment option for men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), but the decision to treat should be carefully considered by the patient and clinician. More studies are needed to find new and better agents.
On 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017 we ran electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of studies in order to find clinical studies that randomly allocated individuals at risk of developing psychosis to receive various treatments for preventing development of psychosis. We were able to include 20 studies with 2151 participants. These studies analysed a wide range of treatments. All the review findings are of, at very best, low quality. There is some suggestion from one small study that people at risk of psychosis may benefit from taking omega-3 fatty acids in terms of reduced transition to psychosis. Other studies found adding antipsychotic drugs to supportive-care packages did not seem to make much difference in terms of transition to full illness. When cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants treated allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy transitioned to psychosis during follow-up by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in people who just received supportive therapy. This could be important but these data are of very low quality. All other testing of CBT and other packages of care found no clear difference between treatments for transition to psychosis. There has been considerable effort and expense invested testing treatment approaches for prevention of the first episode of schizophrenia. Currently, there is some low-quality evidence suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids may be effective, but there is no high-quality evidence to suggest that any type of treatment is effective, and no firm conclusions can be made.
We found 15 studies that compared macrolides with placebo (a substance or treatment with no benefit) or no intervention. Eleven studies involved 690 adults (aged 18 years and older) and four studies involved 190 children. Among adults, six used azithromycin, four roxithromycin, and one erythromycin. The four studies with children used azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin. This review is current to January 2018. The studies on azithromycin reported improved quality of life in adults. We do not have sufficient evidence from other macrolides to make a robust judgement on their use, and we similarly have insufficient evidence from children to draw clear conclusions.
Although we found only a few trials, they do show a possible increase in antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is seen when an antibiotic becomes less effective at killing the bacteria causing the chest infection.
We know that macrolides are associated with higher risk of cardiovascular death and other serious adverse events when they are used to treat other conditions. The data in our review suggest it is possible that people with bronchiectasis are at risk for these adverse effects when taking macrolides. Generally the limited number of studies evaluating macrolides and the variation among them indicate that we cannot be sure of the overall effect of their use in bronchiectasis. Further high-quality studies are needed to examine the role of long-term macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis.
We found 10 randomised controlled studies (studies where schools were assigned to receive FAST or to continue as usual, by a procedure similar to tossing a coin), with a total of more than 9000 children and their families.
Nine of the studies took place in the USA and were funded by agencies in the US federal government. One study took place in the UK. Children's ages ranged from five to nine years, and most of the USA-based children were members of a racial or ethnic minority group. Boys and girls were represented at approximately equal rates. In most studies, FAST was delivered at children's schools after the end of the school day, although in some studies it was delivered outside of school (e.g. at a community centre). The trials lasted about eight weeks and usually examined the effects of FAST compared to no additional intervention. The evidence is current as of December 2018. A meta-analysis is a statistical method of combining data from several studies to reach a single, more robust conclusion. We were able to use data from nine studies in a meta-analysis measuring the impact of FAST for children aged between five and eight years. Although individual studies reported some positive findings, there was little evidence to suggest that being involved in a FAST programme results in important improvements in the primary outcomes of child school performance, parental substance abuse, or parental stress. No study measured child adverse outcomes. Furthermore, there was little evidence to suggest that FAST leads to important improvements in child behaviour or family relations. We judged the certainty of evidence in the included studies for the main review outcomes to be moderate or low risk. Failure to include all families in outcome analyses (attrition) and possible bias in recruitment of families into the trials were the main limitations in the evidence. Evidence on the effectiveness of being assigned to FAST is of moderate to low certainty and does not suggest that being assigned to FAST confers important benefits for students and their families.
We found three trials, involving 189 participants, which showed improvement in hearing thresholds in those treated with vasodilators compared to control groups. However, as the number of patients included in the studies was small, and there were differences in the type, dosage and duration of vasodilator treatment used in each of these studies, the results could not be combined to reach a conclusion. The effectiveness of vasodilators in the treatment of ISSHL could not be proven. Further research is needed.
We found that IV iron may increase blood levels of haemoglobin and iron compared with oral iron. However, IV iron may increase the number of allergic reactions though it may reduce side effects such as constipation, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting seen with oral iron. We did not find sufficient evidence to determine whether IV iron compared with oral iron improved quality of life, altered overall death rate or death due to heart disease. Although the results suggest that IV iron compared with oral iron may be more effective in raising iron and haemoglobin levels, we found insufficient data to determine if the benefits of IV iron are justified by improved quality of life or mortality despite the small risk of potentially serious allergic effects in some patients given IV iron.
We found one small study involving 162 women and their babies (searched date 31 May 2015). The quality of the study was very low to moderate for our outcomes. The study was too small to provide answers to our question as we were most interested in the chance of the babies being born too early, their health and whether they survived. We did find that mothers with multiple pregnancies were more likely to have a caesarean birth if they attended specialised multiple pregnancy clinics. There is insufficient good quality evidence to support the use of specialised clinics for women with multiple pregnancies. There is an urgent need for more good quality studies to answer this important question.

 none of the included studies in this comparison assessed effects on cognitive or neurobehavioural outcomes, or harms. Compared to no intervention, educational interventions probably result in no differences in blood lead levels of young children or floor dust levels (moderate-quality evidence). one study comparing dust control measures with no intervention showed little to no difference in cognitive and neurobehavioural outcomes between the groups after three years to eight years. The same study assessed harms and found none associated with the intervention, but observed two children with side effects in the control group. All included studies in this comparison found that dust control did not lead to more or less reduced blood lead levels of young children (moderate-quality evidence) or floor dust levels than no intervention (very low-quality evidence). Two studies assessed the effect of soil abatement and did not allow any conclusions about its effectiveness (very low-quality evidence). there is insufficient evidence that combination interventions reduce blood lead levels or floor dust lead levels (very low-quality evidence), and further studies need to address this research gap. More research is needed to find out what is effective for preventing children's exposure to lead. Studies should be carried out in different socioeconomic groups in high-, middle- and low-income countries to consider how interventions work in contexts shaped by different levels of industrialisation or environmental and occupational health safety regulations.
The search is current to July of 2016.
Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in North America. Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 351. The mean age across trials ranged between 32.0 and 43.7 years. The majority of studies included mixed samples of male and female participants. The authors had no concerns about funding sources of any included studies. Overall, we found that multidisciplinary treatments may be better than usual care for people with LBP for a duration of six to 12 weeks. Individuals receiving multidisciplinary treatment had less pain, less disability, increased likelihood of return-to-work and fewer sick leave days at 12-month follow-up. However, when comparing multidisciplinary treatments to other treatments (e.g. brief clinical intervention including education and advice on exercise), we found that multidisciplinary treatments may be no better than other treatments. Although we examined adverse events as a secondary outcome, none of the included studies reported this outcome. The quality of the evidence for this review was generally low to very low. This was mainly due to small sample sizes and other study limitations. Moreover, we grouped together studies with differing interventions and comparisons. For example, some of the multidisciplinary interventions were quite intense (e.g. > 30 hours of treatment), whereas others were designed to be brief (e.g. < three hours). This variability across studies makes it more challenging to interpret the findings.
In sum, there is a need for additional, large, high-quality randomised controlled trials before we can make definitive recommendations for clinical practice.
We looked at the effects and costs of mid-urethral sling operations using the two different methods. We also compared different ways of inserting the tape, and using tapes made from different materials. The purpose of this review was to find out how effective these operations are in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence and help determine potential complications rate. We performed a thorough literature search up to June 2014. We identified 81 trials that had a total of 12,113 women. These trials showed that over 80% of women with stress urinary incontinence are cured, or have significant improvement in their symptoms, with either operation, for up to five years after surgery, irrespective of the tapes used and the route of tape insertion. The studies used different questionnaires to assess quality of life, which meant that we could not combine their results . However, the information available for quality of life shows that it improves as a result of these operations, though there is no clear difference between the two procedures. In terms of costs, a non-systematic review of economic studies suggested that transobturator had lower costs than retropubic methods. Only a few trials provided information about the effectiveness of these tapes more than five years after surgery. The evidence that we have been able to assess indicates that the positive effects persist. Tapes passing behind the pubic bone (retropubic) seem to carry a greater risk of injuring the bladder during the operation and of women experiencing problems emptying their bladder completely after surgery. However, this operation leads to less groin pain in the short term. There is some limited evidence that this way of inserting the tape has a lower risk of requiring a repeat operation in the long term compared to tapes passing through the groin (transobturator). There is moderate quality evidence that overall reported rates of tape-related complications are low, such as erosion of the tape into the vagina at about 2% for both routes of tape insertion. The reported occurrence of problems with sexual intercourse including pain was low, and leakage of urine during intercourse are improved following insertion of these tapes. Most of our results are based on moderate quality evidence. Most trials did not describe their methods clearly, thus leading to some degree of uncertainty in the findings. At present there are only a limited number of randomised controlled trials (these produce the most reliable results) that have published data beyond five years after surgery. This means that evidence about how effective and safe these procedures are in the longer term lags behind the evidence for them in the short and medium term (up to five years). Longer-term data are required to help increase the reliability of longer-term results.
We searched for evidence on 15 May 2017. We did not find any trials for inclusion in this review. We excluded five trials because they were not randomised controlled trials. There is no evidence available to guide how best to investigate the causes of stillbirth. Seeking to determine the causes of a baby's death is an essential component of quality maternity care in any setting. Future trials on this topic would be helpful, but such trials would need to be designed in a way that ensures all parents in the trial still receive the minimum standard of care in their local setting. Future trials would need to be conducted with the utmost care and consideration for the needs, concerns, and values of parents and families. Assessment of longer-term psychosocial variables, economic costs to health services, and effects on subsequent pregnancy care and outcomes should be considered in any future trials.
This review examined the current evidence on the best way to administer chemotherapy and radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery. We were able to include three randomised trials. Two of these, with 853 women, assessed radiotherapy and chemotherapy given at the same time versus chemotherapy given first followed by radiotherapy. The third trial randomised 244 women to radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The evidence produced by these three well-conducted trials suggests that recurrence of a woman's cancer and her chances of dying from breast cancer are similar regardless of the order of the treatments, provided that both radiotherapy and chemotherapy are commenced within seven months of the surgery. The trials provided limited information regarding adverse events, side effects or quality of life associated with the different sequences of treatment. The limited evidence available does suggest that the frequency and severity of side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are similar regardless of which sequence is used. However, it should be noted that the women in these trials were treated, on average, in the early 2000s. As a result, the trials do not assess the modern types of radiotherapy, and new types of chemotherapy (such as taxanes) or other drugs (such as Herceptin). We will add relevant trials that include these more recent treatments to future updates of this review.
One trial was found that examined the effect of inotropes in infants with low systemic blood flow. The trial found that many infants failed to respond to the two commonly used inotropes (dobutamine and dopamine) and neither was better at improving outcomes of very preterm babies. Further research is needed to determine the best strategy for preventing or treating low systemic or organ blood flow in these very immature babies.
In the current review, data were found and analysed from 7 trials involving 404 patients randomly allocated to receive antibiotics or placebo. Although death occurred less after antibiotics (8.4%) than placebo (14.4%), as did infected pancreatic necrosis (19.7% versus 24.4%) and other infections (23.7% versus 36%), the differences were not statistically significant and so genuine benefit cannot be confirmed. There were no major problems with antibiotic resistance, and fungal infections were similar (3.9% versus 5%). The quality of studies was variable and only two were ‘blinded’, whereby investigators and patients were unaware of which treatment patients received. Many different regimens were used, and of the two main types of antibiotics used, a beta-lactam appeared to work better. Only one type of antibiotic (imipenem) was considered on its own, showing a significant decrease in infection of the pancreatic necrosis.
Although we cannot confirm benefit from the use of prophylactic antibiotics in this condition, consistent trends towards a beneficial effect nevertheless remain. Further, better designed studies, ideally with beta-lactam antibiotics, are required.
We found seven relevant studies of 1550 people with COPD. We did not include studies that gave other treatments, such as an exercise programme or longer educational sessions, along with an action plan. People in three studies had ongoing support to help them use the action plan. People in the included studies had moderate to severe symptoms and were followed up for six or 12 months. People with COPD who are given an action plan have fewer emergency department visits and hospital stays related to breathing problems over a year. We calculated that for every 19 people given an action plan, one person would avoid a hospital stay for an exacerbation.
People with an action plan took more corticosteroid and antibiotic medicines for exacerbations - on average just under one more course of corticosteroids and two more courses of antibiotics over a year.
Some studies showed that giving people an action plan improved their ability to recognise and self-start treatment for worsening COPD symptoms.
Giving people an action plan made no difference in their chance of dying from any cause over a year, but this finding showed some variability.
We could not say whether follow-up phone calls added benefit over following an action plan alone. The evidence in this review is generally independent and reliable, and we are very or moderately certain about the results. We believe that people with COPD should be given an individualised action plan with a short educational component so they can benefit from fewer and shorter hospital stays, better understanding of the need to self-start treatment and appropriate use of medication for exacerbations.
We identified and included in this review randomized controlled trials of adults that compared conventional mechanical ventilation in the face-down versus the face-up position. Reports from nine trials of 2165 participants (12 publications) show that prone ventilation did not appear to be of benefit for all participants requiring ventilation. The evidence suggested some situations in which it may improve survival. One group of participants with the most severe lung damage appeared to have reduced mortality, as did participants who received treatment early and for prolonged periods. Complications were described. The most common of these were pressure sores (or ulcers) and tracheal tube blockage or obstruction. Low blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms were also seen. The application of prone position to all participants in intensive care who have low oxygen levels was not supported by the evidence identified, but some particular groups of participants, for example, those with especially low oxygen levels, may benefit from prone positioning. Further clinical trials would assist in clarifying potential benefits for such patient groups but further trials may not take place because of the very large treatment benefit observed in the most recent clinical trial of participants with very low oxygen levels. In the absence of new trials, meta-analysis of individual patient data may facilitate further assessment as well as further observational studies in at risk populations. The quality of the evidence for primary outcomes of this systematic review was low as a result of serious inconsistency and important potential bias.
This is an update of the original review published in 2009 for which no studies met the inclusion criteria. For this update, in a search of the published literature in November 2014 we found one moderate quality randomised controlled trial which compared ABH (Ativan®, Benadryl®, Haldol®) gel, containing haloperidol and two other medications, to placebo.
The trial showed no difference between ABH gel and placebo. However it has previously been shown that haloperidol is not absorbed after applying ABH gel, so this result is not surprising. We identified a trial of haloperidol for nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer, with initial results presented at a conference. This suggests that haloperidol is effective in 65% of patients, but the results were not fully published at the time of our review. A further trial has opened in Australia, comparing haloperidol with another medication used for nausea, methotrimeprazine (levomepromazine).
We wanted to find out if a combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) works better than usual care alone to reduce the number of people who die from paraquat poisoning.
We also wanted to find out if treatment with steroids plus cyclophosphamide causes an increased number of infections in patients. We searched for studies that investigated the use of steroids and cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) compared with usual care alone in people poisoned with paraquat.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found four studies that involved 463 people with confirmed paraquat poisoning. Two studies were conducted in Taiwan (Republic of China), one in Iran, and one in Sri Lanka.
All participants were given either:
- usual care only, or
- steroids (methylprednisolone alone, or with dexamethasone) plus cyclophosphamide, as well as usual care. Cyclophosphamide was given before the steroid(s) or at the same time as them.
Two of the studies measured the severity of poisoning by testing patients’ plasma (a component of blood) at the start of the study. Plasma tests provide the best assessment of how seriously a person is affected by paraquat poisoning.
One study used a placebo (sham) treatment in addition to usual care. Two studies gave patients a steroid (dexamethasone) as part of the usual care. The combined results of two studies showed that steroids plus cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) may slightly reduce the risk of death compared to usual care alone (with, or without, placebo) in people with paraquat poisoning. One large study showed that at 3 months after discharge from hospital there may be no difference in the number of deaths between the people treated with steroids plus cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) and those treated with usual care alone. Two small studies checked levels of white blood cells in patients (low levels can increase risk of infection). Neither study reported any infections in the week following treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide. Due to the small size of the studies, we are very uncertain about whether the treatment affects the risk of infection within one week of treatment. The four studies differed in terms of the number of people in them, assessment of level of paraquat poisoning, and types of treatment. This limited our ability to draw firm conclusions from the evidence.
Overall, the studies we found were too small to provide answers to our questions. This review updates our previous review on this subject. The evidence is up to date to September 2020.
We searched for evidence in February 2018, and found three randomised controlled trials, involving over 26,000 women. Two trials contributed data to our analyses; one study did not provide data for any of the outcomes of interest in this review. All of the trials took place in hospital settings. Two trials took place in India, the other was conducted in 13 different European countries. The trials examined different methods of estimating blood loss.
One trial (conducted in 13 European countries, involving over 25,000 women) compared the use of a calibrated drape (direct estimation) to visual estimation (indirect estimation). Moderate-quality evidence showed there was probably little or no difference between the methods for the risk of women developing serious conditions (e.g. failure to form clots, poor functioning of the liver, kidneys, and brain, admission to intensive care); their need for blood transfusion; the use of fluids to maintain their blood pressure; or the use of drugs to help their uterus contract to stop the bleeding. The trial did not report the number of women who had anaemia after birth, blood loss of at least 500 mL, or infection.
One trial (conducted in India, involving 900 women) compared the use of a calibrated drape (direct estimation) to weighing and measuring blood and blood-soaked materials (indirect method). High-quality evidence showed that calibrated drapes were better than measuring the blood and blood-soaked materials at detecting blood loss of at least 500 mL. Low-quality evidence showed there may be little or no difference between methods in the need for blood transfusion or fluids to maintain blood pressure. High-quality evidence showed little or no difference in the use of drugs to help the uterus contract in order to stop bleeding. The trial did not report the number of women who had anaemia after birth or infection, or the risk of developing serious conditions (such as failure to form clots, poor functioning of the liver, kidneys, and brain, or being admitted to intensive care). There was insufficient evidence to support the use of one method over another to estimate blood loss after vaginal birth. There is a need for high quality trials that measure important outcomes, such as those listed in this review.
We found 14 randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that described the effects of CBT in 700 adults with ADHD, aged between 18 and 65 years. Thirteen trials took place in the northern hemisphere and one in Australia.
Of the included studies, three compared CBT versus other specific interventions and seven versus unspecific control conditions (unspecific supportive therapy, waiting list or no treatment). Additionally, two compared CBT plus pharmacotherapy versus pharmacotherapy alone. One trial compared CBT to two control groups, one of which was given other specific non-pharmacological treatment and one of which was a no-treatment control. Because of imprecision (i.e. inaccurate results), inconsistency (i.e. results differ across trials) and methodological limitations, we considered the quality of the evidence of the included studies to range from very low to moderate. The findings suggest that CBT might improve the core symptoms of ADHD, reducing inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.
When combined with pharmacotherapy, there was evidence of an improvement in global functioning (i.e. a person's overall level of functioning in life) and a reduction in depression and anxiety compared to that seen with pharmacotherapy alone.
None of the included studies reported severe adverse events. However, five participants described some type of adverse event, such as distress and anxiety.
Despite the evidence accumulated from biological and epidemiological (observational) studies and non-randomised clinical trials, only one randomised, controlled trial could be included in this review. This study had 44 participants. Participants who were given a single glucose drink showed possible momentary enhancement of cognitive performance compared to those given a saccharin drink. A safety assessment was not reported. We need more studies on different types of carbohydrates, particularly those from fruit, vegetable and whole grain sources, for older adults with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment to understand the role of this nutrient type in the prevention or reduction of cognitive decline.
We wanted to know whether comprehensive care programmes are effective for children with medical complexity. Comprehensive care programmes provide care coordination that helps communication between members of a child's treating teams and aims to provide children with optimal health care. Care coordination may involve things such as planning treatment, monitoring outcomes and resource use, coordinating visits with doctors, avoiding unnecessary tests and services, sharing information among healthcare professionals and family, planning discharge from hospital, and training of caregivers and local services. We wanted to see if these care programmes improve the health and quality of life of children and their families, improve the quality of health care delivered to them, reduce the number of visits to hospital and the number of different medical specialists children see, and whether they reduce the costs of health care. We also wanted to know if all children were able to access these programmes, and whether the programmes had any unwanted effects. We searched the literature thoroughly and found studies of children aged 0 to 21 years of age who were considered medically complex, that is, having a chronic condition that causes functional limitations creating high healthcare needs, which results in increased healthcare costs. We included studies that compared children who received comprehensive care with those that did not receive this care or who received usual treatment without care coordination. The care could be hospital-based, a hospital-community collaborative programme, or community-based. We found four studies with a total of 912 children as participants that compared comprehensive care to standard hospital care without special care coordination for children with medical complexity. These studies all had limitations. We found that comprehensive care probably makes little to no difference to parent health, functioning and quality of life, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions. Comprehensive care may make little to no difference to child health, functioning, and quality of life, and costs to the healthcare system. It may slightly improve child and family satisfaction with, and perceptions of, care and service delivery. There was no information in the studies about whether all children are able to access comprehensive care, whether there are any unwanted effects, and what the cost is to families. Overall, the quality of the research is low to moderate and therefore we are uncertain about the effectiveness of comprehensive care for children with medical complexity. We are therefore not able to draw any strong conclusions. There was a limited number of studies that met the criteria for this review. The four studies we found were all from North America, and we do not have information from other countries. Only one study assessed the effect of care coordination on parent health, functioning, and quality of life, and no studies assessed the costs to the family or unwanted effects. The variation in participants and interventions examined across the four studies is a limitation to be considered when interpreting the results. The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to May 2023.
Twenty-one trials (with over 2000 participants) were included. Paracetamol provided a statistically significant benefit when compared with placebo for pain relief at both 4 and 6 hours after taking the drug. It is most effective at 1000 mg dose, and can be taken at six hourly intervals without compromising safety. There was no statistically significant difference between the number of patients who reported adverse events, overall this being 19% in the paracetamol group and 16% in the placebo group. It should be noted that most of the studies were found to have some limitations mainly due to poor reporting of information. However the review concludes that paracetamol is a safe, effective drug for the treatment of postoperative pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.
We wanted to find if lowering blood pressure below standard levels is better than maintaining standard blood pressure levels at preventing heart disease, progression of kidney injury, and death in people with high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease. We searched for studies that investigated the benefits and harms of lowering blood pressure in adults with chronic kidney disease. Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers, such as 120/80. The first number is the pressure in the arteries as the heart pumps out blood during each beat, and is called 'systolic blood pressure'. The second number is the pressure as the heart relaxes before the next beat, and is called 'diastolic blood pressure'. A reading of 130/80 mmHg ('mmHg' is a common blood pressure measurement unit) is considered a low blood pressure target in the context of people with kidney disease and high blood pressure. We gathered studies that compared people assigned to lower blood pressure targets (130/80 mmHg or lower) with those assigned to standard blood pressure levels (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg).
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.
This review received no funding. We found six studies involving 7348 people with chronic kidney disease and high blood pressure. The largest study included 4733 people relevant to our review, and the smallest study, 840 people. Participants were followed for between one and eight years. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one in the USA and Canada, one in several countries in the Americas along with Spain, and one in the Americas, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Three studies were publicly funded, two were privately funded, and one had both public and private funding.
We found that, compared to standard levels, lower blood pressure targets probably make little to no difference to the number of people who: died from any cause;•had serious unwanted and harmful events;•had cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart attack, or problems with arteries and veins.
Lower blood pressure targets may make little to no difference to the number of people: who died due to heart problems;•whose kidney disease worsened. A main limitation of the evidence was that all six studies allowed participants and clinicians to know to which treatment group each participant was assigned. Also, the studies provided very scarce information on serious unwanted and harmful events. All the studies measured people's blood pressure in medical offices, and the results might differ if people's blood pressure is measured in different settings (e.g. at home). The evidence is current to 8 August 2023.
First, we searched for randomized controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarized the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. We found 33 studies that involved a total of 1499 people aged 18 years or older. These studies were conducted in Asia, Europe and the USA, and followed people for between one month and one year. Most people in the studies were women, and most people were near-sighted.
Twelve studies reported their source of funding: two studies were funded by the US government, three studies were industry-funded and seven studies did not receive any specific funding.
Few studies provided information about the main effects that interested us:
- improvement in vision one year after surgery; and
- the occurrence of unwanted (adverse) effects such as significant vision loss, halos (seeing bright circles around light sources) or glare (discomfort caused by intense light).
We have little to very little confidence in the evidence from the studies we found, mainly because the studies:
- produced imprecise and inconsistent results; and
- were designed or conducted in ways that could introduce error into their results.
Conventional excimer laser refractive surgery versus wavefront-modified techniques
In procedures where the surgeon removes the outer layer of the front of the eye to access the treatment area (photorefractive keratectomy, PRK), there may be little to no difference between conventional and wavefront-modified techniques in vision improvement one year after surgery (one study).
No studies investigated conventional surgery versus wavefront-modified techniques in procedures where the surgeon creates a small flap in the front of the eye to access the treatment area (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis, LASIK).
Comparisons between different wavefront-modified techniques
There may be little to no difference between wavefront-optimized and wavefront-guided procedures (two different types of wavefront-modified technique) in vision improvement one year after surgery (six studies).
Our confidence in the evidence is too low to determine whether there is any difference in effect between wavefront-guided PRK and wavefront-guided LASIK (one study).
Adverse effects
Fewer studies that reported information on unwanted effects suggest that there may be little or no differences between the procedures that were compared in terms of unwanted effects. There may be little to no difference in improvement of vision between:
- conventional excimer laser refractive surgery and wavefront-modified techniques when using PRK;
- wavefront-optimized and wavefront-guided procedures.
We do not know which procedures are associated with fewer unwanted effects, because of limited evidence.
More, large and well-conducted studies are needed to improve the evidence and provide information about unwanted effects. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to August 2019.
This review found 15 randomised controlled trials which assessed the effectiveness of the interventions used to prevent ear discharge after surgery. The findings in seven low risk of bias trials (and part of an eighth) showed a reduction in the rate of ear discharge up to two weeks after the operation using either saline washouts or a single application of antibiotics at the time of the operation. A prolonged application of antibiotics was also effective. The effects were largest in studies with a high rate of ear discharge.
We conclude that the use of an intervention to prevent postoperative ear discharge should be restricted to those at a high risk of this discharge, but the choice of which treatment may be left to the surgeon.
In this review we found four studies with a total of 224 participants that were suitable for inclusion; one was performed exclusively in children and three in adolescents or adults. However, data could only be obtained from two studies; both studies used mucolytics (ambroxol and bromhexine) in conjunction with antibiotics. Combining these two studies, the rate of cure or improvement in cough of people who received mucolytics was similar to those who did not. However, in the secondary analysis, children who received a mucolytic were more likely to be cured of cough (the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) at day 10 was 5 for children and 4 for adults). There were no reported increased adverse events in the treatment group.
The range of possible adverse events associated with OTC medications for cough is wide and includes minimal adverse events (such as with the use of honey) to serious adverse events, such as altered heart rate patterns, drowsiness and death in young children. The studies included in this review did not report any detectable increase in adverse events. There were no obvious biases in the studies.
This review has substantial limitations due to the unavailability of data from studies. Also there are no studies of other common OTC medications used for cough, such as antihistamines and antitussives.
Thus, there is insufficient evidence to draw any definitive conclusions on the role of OTC medications taken as an additional treatment for cough associated with acute pneumonia. Mucolytics may be beneficial but the lack of consistent evidence precludes recommending the routine use of mucolytics as an addition in the treatment of troublesome cough associated with pneumonia in children or adults. The evidence is current to January 2014.
We conducted our most recent search for studies in March 2018 and combined with an earlier search selected 29 clinical studies reporting the evaluation of PCR tests prospectively in cohorts of people at high risk of IA. None of the companies involved in the diagnosis of invasive fungal diseases funded any of the studies included in the review. Most studies were at low risk of bias and low concern regarding applicability. However, differences in the reference standard may have contributed to differences we found in the distribution of cases as being classified as IA or not. Several PCR techniques were used in the studies. Pooling the data from the studies showed that sensitivity and specificity of PCR for the diagnosis of IA varied (from 59% to 79.2% and from 79% to 95.2%, respectively) depending on the interpretative criteria used to define a test as positive. When used as a diagnostic criterion for IA in a population of 100 people with a disease prevalence of 16.3% (overall mean prevalence), a single PCR positive test would have missed three people with the disease, and falsely classified 17 people as having the disease, who would be treated unnecessarily or referred for further tests. A requirement of two positive tests as a diagnostic criterion in a population with the same disease prevalence would miss nine people with the disease and falsely classify four people as having the disease. These numbers should be interpreted with caution because the reference standard is based on the degree of certainty of diagnosis and is rarely proven so cannot provide consistent assessment of cases as being IA or not.
Overall, PCR shows moderate diagnostic accuracy when used as a screening test for IA in high-risk patient groups. Importantly, when the rate of sensitivity is low, the sensitivity of the tests means that a negative result allows the diagnosis to be excluded with confidence except when the patient is receiving certain antifungal drugs. With the low prevalence of the disease, a high negative predictive value such that a negative test allows the diagnosis to be excluded.
We looked at randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of opioid-exposed newborns treated with one or more non-pharmacological care practice. Non-pharmacological care practices include changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing, changes to feeding frequency or type, changes that increase maternal care of the newborn or maternal wellness, and multiple changes such as occur in a new site or system of care. Search is up to date as of October 2019. This review included six RCTs that enrolled 353 opioid-exposed newborns. The studies were published between 1975 and 2018. We also identified seven ongoing studies that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete.
Of the six RCTs, four assessed changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing. These studies examined the effect of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning (lying on tummy), non-oscillating waterbed, and a low-stimulation nursery. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with length of hospitalization based on one study with 30 infants. Modifying environmental stimulation may be associated with little or no difference in use of pharmacological treatment based on three studies with 92 infants. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with weight nadir (lowest weight recorded during birth hospitalization) based on one study with 194 infants.
One study assessed a change to the feeding type comparing higher-calorie formula to standard-calorie formula. We are uncertain whether feeding practices are associated with use of medicines, days to regain birth weight, or weight nadir based on one study with 46 infants.
One study assessed changes to support the mother with tailored breastfeeding support. We are uncertain whether support of the mother-infant dyad is associated with length of hospitalization, use of medicines, or neonatal intensive care unit admission based on one study with 14 infants.
Many potential important effects were not reported, and others were not reported in all studies. We are uncertain whether one or more specific non-pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. The quality of evidence for all outcomes is very low to low and provides limited information to inform individual non-pharmacological care practices or combinations of non-pharmacological care practices.
We found 15 randomised controlled studies involving over 2000 pregnant women with urinary infections, but no symptoms. Antibiotics may be effective in reducing the incidence of kidney infection in the mother (12 studies, 2017 women) and clearing the infection from the urine (four studies, 596 women). They may also reduce the incidence of preterm births (three studies, 327 women) and low birthweight babies (six studies, 1437 babies). None of the studies adequately assessed any adverse effects of antibiotic treatment for the mother or her baby, and often the way the study was done was not well described.
We assessed the three main outcomes with the GRADE approach, and found low-certainty evidence that antibiotic treatment may prevent pyelonephritis, preterm birth, and birthweight less than 2500 g. Antibiotic treatment may reduce the risk of kidney infections in pregnant women who have a urine infection but show no symptoms of infection. Antibiotics may also reduce the chance a baby will be born too early or have a low birthweight. However, because of the low certainty of the evidence, it is difficult to draw conclusions; more research is needed.
This review has assessed the evidence from studies that compared the use of the two types of fluid with patients who had been injured or burned, or were having surgery. Not enough evidence is available, however, to decide which crystalloid concentration is best. More research is needed.
High withdrawal rates from the trials limit the confidence that can be placed on the results. Olanzapine was superior to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms both as monotherapy and combined with mood stabilizers, though caused weight gain. Olanzapine was more efficacious than divalproex and caused less nausea but more weight gain, somnolence and movement disorders. Olanzapine was comparable to haloperidol in efficacy, caused less movement disorders but greater weight gain.
The review shows that while combined chiropractic interventions slightly improved pain and disability in the short term and pain in the medium term for acute and subacute low-back pain, there is currently no evidence to support or refute that combined chiropractic interventions provide a clinically meaningful advantage over other treatments for pain or disability in people with low-back pain. Any demonstrated differences were small and were only seen in studies with a high risk of bias. Future research is very likely to change the results and our confidence in them. Well conducted randomised trials are required that compare combined chiropractic interventions to other established therapies for low-back pain.
This review of studies of vitamin E supplements found that while extra vitamin E reduces the chances of some complications (including disease of the retina), the risk of life-threatening infection is increased. The risk of bleeding in the brain is increased when extra vitamin E is given by vein but decreased when the extra vitamin E is given by other routes.
We searched scientific databases for clinical studies of people of any age with low platelet counts requiring a lumbar puncture or epidural anaesthesia. The evidence is current to 13 February 2018. In this review, we found only three cohort studies. Only two of these studies reported outcomes relevant to this review. Both studies included people with low platelet counts and blood cancer; one included 21 adults and the other included 129 children. Both studies compared people who had and had not received platelet transfusions before the insertion of a lumbar puncture needle. No studies assessed the use of platelet transfusions prior to insertion of an epidural catheter or different platelet count thresholds for platelet transfusion administration prior to a procedure. There were no major procedure-related bleeding complications in either study. No serious adverse events occurred in the one study (21 participants) that reported this outcome.
There was little or no difference in the number of minor bleeding complications in either adults or children who received or did not receive platelet transfusions.
None of the studies reported on death, number of platelet transfusions given after the procedure, length of hospital stay, or quality of life. The quality of the evidence from the included studies was very poor.
We found no evidence from randomised controlled trials to answer our review question.
A study would need to be designed with at least 47,030 participants to be able to detect an increase in the number of people who had bleeding after lumbar puncture or epidural anaesthetic from 1 in 1000 to 2 in 1000. A study that uses routinely collected electronic medical records (big data) is likely to be the only study design that could answer our review question.
This review includes nine randomized trials with a total of 484 participants. The limited data available suggest that rectal 5-ASA is effective and safe for maintenance of remission in UC. Rectal 5-ASA was found to be superior to placebo (e.g. enema or suppository with no active medicine). There was no difference in the incidence of side effects between rectal 5-ASA and placebo groups. Side effects were generally mild in nature and common side effects included anal irritation and abdominal pain. Studies comparing rectal 5-ASA with oral 5-ASA (pills) found no differences in effectiveness for maintenance therapy. Well designed randomized trials are needed to investigate different doses of rectal 5-ASA for maintenance therapy, Future studies should assess the effectiveness of combination therapy of oral 5-ASA with rectal 5-ASA as this has been found to be effective in active UC and has not been investigated for maintenance therapy. Future studies should also compare rectal 5-ASA with rectal corticosteroids.
This review found that, despite limited research, there is some evidence that guidelines can improve care and that professional roles can be substituted effectively, for instance a nurse can perform the function of a physician in certain circumstances. Such interventions offer the possibility of reduced costs but further research is needed in all areas of this topic.
We wanted to identify whether adenoidectomy was better than no treatment, or other types of treatment (such as medicines), for children with OME.
We also wanted to see if there were any unwanted effects associated with having an adenoidectomy. We searched for studies that compared adenoidectomy with either no treatment, or a different treatment, in children with OME. We compared and summarised the study results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 10 studies that involved 1785 children. We did not identify any studies that compared adenoidectomy to medical treatment - only studies that compared adenoidectomy to no adenoidectomy. All the evidence we found was thought to be uncertain, because of issues with how the studies were conducted, and the relatively small number of people included.
For children and carers, a return to normal hearing is likely to be important, but few studies measured this outcome so we are uncertain about the effect adenoidectomy has on hearing.
Adenoidectomy may reduce the number of children with persistent OME after one to two years of follow-up, but the difference may be small.
We did not find any evidence about quality of life, so we do not know if adenoidectomy has any impact on this.
Few studies reported any information about possible harms of treatment. We know that bleeding is a risk with any surgery. As part of this review we found that two children out of 416 who received adenoidectomy suffered from significant bleeding, compared to no children (out of 375) who did not have an adenoidectomy. As the evidence was uncertain, we cannot be sure if adenoidectomy gives any benefit for children with OME. We also found very little information about harms of adenoidectomy, although we know that there are likely to be some risks associated with undergoing surgery. The evidence is up-to-date to January 2023.
We included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), none supported by industry, with 3665 participants directly comparing bevacizumab with ranibizumab. Six RCTs were completed and published, two RCTs were completed, but unpublished, and one was still in progress. We were able to include safety information from all trials, accessing both published and unpublished data.
Drugs were administered for up to two years according to continuous or discontinuous treatment. In the first, drugs were regularly administered, irrespective of the remission or progression of the disease; the latter involved 'as needed' (pro re nata, PRN) or 'treat-and-extend' regimens in which the drug was injected less frequently as long as there was no recurrence of neovascular manifestations. Follow-up for adverse events occurred at regular intervals up to one or two years, irrespective of continuous or discontinuous treatment.
All studies used the approved dosage of ranibizumab (0.5 mg) according to the 'Summary of Product Characteristics', and the dosage of bevacizumab most recommended by ophthalmologists for intravitreal injection (1.25 mg).
Three studies excluded patients at high cardiovascular risk. However, four RCTs considered patients at different cardiovascular risks, representing a wide spectrum of risks and routine practice in hospital settings. Our review found the systemic safety of bevacizumab for neovascular AMD to be similar to that of ranibizumab, except for gastrointestinal disorders, which was a part of a secondary analysis.
If 1000 people were treated with ranibizumab for one or two years, 34 would die. If treated instead with bevacizumab, between 27 and 53 of them would die. If 1000 people were treated with ranibizumab, 222 would experience one or more SSAEs. If 1000 people were treated instead with bevacizumab, between 200 and 291 would experience such an event. Deaths are likely to be unrelated to the administration of drugs. We could not fully assess the quality of three unpublished studies. We rated the overall quality of the evidence as low to moderate because we could not be certain that one drug was better than the other one on many of our outcomes. Another limitation of the studies was the participants who were recruited into them, and the fact that studies may have missed measuring the outcomes of interest in a few individuals that might have experienced a SSAE. Missing information was equally common in participants treated with bevacizumab and those treated with ranibizumab.
It is known that treatment with the drug interferon clears hepatitis C virus from the blood in about 15% of patients. This review identified studies comparing ribavirin plus interferon with interferon alone in patients with chronic hepatitis C. This review shows, by combining the results from all trials, that adding ribavirin to interferon increases the number of patients who clear the hepatitis C virus to about 40% as well as the number of patients who demonstrate improved liver histology. Ribavirin and interferon may also reduce the risk of liver-related morbidity or all-cause mortality. However, the number needed to treat to prevent one patient developing morbidity or dying seems very large. Furthermore, combination therapy was associated with increased risk of anaemia and several other adverse reactions.
The results gives rise to a dilemma - should we, by adding ribavirin to interferon, increase the risk of haematological, dermatological, gastrointestinal, infectious, and miscellaneous adverse reactions in a situation where it has not yet been clearly demonstrated that the antiviral effect of the intervention is directly linked to the reduction of all-cause mortality? We, therefore, suggest that the combination intervention is applied only with stringent emphasis on the individual patients' well-being. Furthermore, we suggest that all future trials within the area should focus more on adverse reactions and long-term clinical outcomes.
We included seven randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in our review. These involved 500 adults undergoing eye surgery under local anaesthesia. We looked at any additional effect of adding hyaluronidase to local anaesthetic on the pain experienced during eye surgery. We also looked at participant and surgical satisfaction scores and if any harms were reported after using hyaluronidase in the injection solution. None of the studies reported on costs. Of the seven included trials, we pooled the results of four trials (289 participants) as the results were reported in a similar manner. They found that addition of hyaluronidase did not significantly reduce pain during surgery. Among the three remaining trials (211 participants) lack of data reporting in two trials made it difficult to pool the results. The overall result of looking at all these trials together suggests there was no significant reduction of pain with using hyaluronidase in eye nerve blocks.
We found moderate quality evidence from two trials (122 participants) to suggest that addition of hyaluronidase increased participant satisfaction scores. Three studies involving 141 participants looked at surgical satisfaction, which was reported as superior with hyaluronidase in the two larger studies and not significantly different in one small study (19 participants). None of the included studies reported any harmful effects of hyaluronidase. The included trials that reported on pain during surgery were at low risk for bias. The overall quality of evidence was low because of variations in the effect on pain reduction. We contacted all trial authors to request more information on the trials, but the data were not available.
Moderate quality studies reported greater participant and surgical satisfaction with hyaluronidase.
Analgesia alone does not take into account the full spectrum of the beneficial effects of hyaluronidase. Patient comfort with the eye surgery is also likely to be improved by a speedy onset and reduced eye movements due to hyaluronidase.
In June 2014 we searched for as many relevant medical studies as we could find that had a robust design (randomised controlled trials) that had compared hydrogel dressings with other treatments for pressure ulcers. We found 11 studies involving a total of 539 participants. From the results of these studies we could not tell whether hydrogel wound dressings heal pressure ulcers more quickly or slowly than other types of dressing or topical treatments.
Generally, the studies we found were small and the results inconclusive. Some studies lacked information about how they were conducted and it was difficult to tell whether the results presented were robust. More research of better quality is needed before it can be determined whether hydrogel dressings are better or worse at healing pressure ulcers than other types of dressings or topical treatments.
The purpose of this review was to assess whether the use of intravenous aminophylline in children receiving maximised inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids produced additional beneficial effects. We identified a small number of good quality trials which compared aminophylline with placebo in children given inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoid therapy. This review found evidence that children treated with aminophylline had a greater improvement in lung function than children treated with placebo, when both groups received inhaled bronchodilators and steroids and they responded incompletely to these initial therapies. However, aminophylline use also resulted in greater risk of vomiting. Aminophylline use in children may be appropriate if children have a role in severe acute exacerbations of asthma where response to maximised therapy (inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids) is poor. These results are based on small numbers and further work in this area is required.
Four studies (with a total of 528 participants) were identified that met the inclusion criterion of comparing mucolytic treatment versus no mucolytic treatment. All studies were conducted in adults. One study considered bromhexine versus placebo, two compared RhDNase versus placebo (one for a period of two weeks and the other over a period of 24 weeks) and the fourth compared erdosteine with physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone in elderly patients. The small number of studies available for review and their different designs meant that only descriptions of the individual studies were possible with very limited opportunities for combining the studies in single analyses. No strong evidence is available to support the use of these drugs in people with bronchiectasis (from causes other than cystic fibrosis); however it is not possible to draw any clear conclusions, as so few studies have been reported. Details of the way patients were allocated to receive or not receive mucolytics were not clearly described in any of the four studies. This was considered carefully in the review in relation to our level of uncertainty in interpreting the results. When this is taken into account, together with the imprecision of the results, estimates of the usefulness of mucolytics as treatment were generally judged to be of low quality in relation to (non–cystic fibrosis) bronchiectasis.
Fifteen studies which lasted between 4 to 24 weeks including a total of 1219 participants were analysed. Trials of chitosan to date have varied considerably in terms of quality. The review suggests that chitosan may have a small effect on body weight but results from high quality trials indicate that this effect is likely to be minimal.
Only a small number of studies of hypnotherapy have been performed and the way these studies were carried out was not up to a high standard. Hypnotherapy was either compared with standard treatment of IBS, with supportive psychotherapy (discussion of symptoms and possible contributing emotional problems and stressful life events) or with no treatment in patients on a waiting list to be seen by a specialist.
What is IBS and could hypnotherapy work as treatment? 
IBS is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and an abnormal pattern of bowel movements (i.e. diarrhea, constipation or mixed diarrhea and constipation). Hypnotherapy could provide benefit for IBS, by affecting parts of the brain that experience abdominal pain or influence the movement of the bowel.
What did the studies show? 
The studies provide some evidence that suggests that hypnotherapy might be effective in treating IBS symptoms including abdominal pain. However the results of these studies should be interpreted with caution due to poor study quality and small size.
How safe is hypnotherapy? 
Hypnotherapy was well tolerated and no serious side effects were reported in the studies.
What is the bottom line? 
Although current data are promising, there is insufficient evidence to allow any conclusion about the effectiveness of hypnotherapy for the treatment of IBS. More research with well designed studies is needed.
Limitations: variability in treatment regimens among trials precluded determination of the optimal rituximab maintenance regimen. One trial compared rituximab maintenance to rituximab at disease progression for patients with lower tumour burden and found both options to be comparable. 
Future research should focus on: 
the effect of rituximab maintenance compared to rituximab at progression; 
defining which patients benefit the most from rituximab, according to burden of disease, prognostic score, the type of chemotherapy regimens used for induction, and the inclusion of rituximab in induction; and 
the optimal duration of maintenance treatment, as well as its schedule. 
Both randomised controlled trials and observational trials should have longer follow up in order to assess the long-term toxicity of rituximab, and should evaluate quality of life outcomes.
This review examines the effects of risperidone compared to other second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) drugs for schizophrenia. We identified 45 relevant studies with 7760 participants comparing risperidone with amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, sertindole and ziprasidone. Comparisons of risperidone with zotepine are currently not available. Risperidone was somewhat more successful than quetiapine and ziprasidone, but somewhat less successful than clozapine and olanzapine. The main disadvantage of risperidone were more frequent movement disorders and more prolactin increase compared to most other SGA drugs.
We included randomized trials that recruited adults with ischemic stroke, at any time after onset. We included any kind of stem cell or method of administration. We identified seven randomized trials, involving 401 participants. Overall, stem cell transplantation was associated with a reduced neurological impairment, but not with a better functional outcome. No safety concerns were raised. The certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low because of the risk of bias in the included studies, the lack of precision of the results, and different designs. More well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed.
Major surgery is usually associated with significant pain. The mainstay of treatment for pain following major surgery is opioid medications (strong pain killers such as morphine). However, opioids are not always entirely effective and are associated with side effects including sleepiness (sedation), shallow breathing (respiratory depression), feeling sick (nausea), and being sick (vomiting). Co-administered medications, like paracetamol, may help improve postoperative pain control and reduce the need for opioids.
We included nine clinical trials with a total of 666 participants. We searched several databases to March 2014, to find placebo-controlled, randomized trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups, one of which includes a pretend (placebo) group) of nicotine for postoperative pain. We also contacted study authors for additional data. Not all studies reported all of the symptoms (outcomes) listed above, so what we can say about some outcomes is limited. We re-ran the search on 28 April 2015. We will assess the one study of interest when we update this review. Our results indicated that there is low quality evidence that nicotine use results in slightly lower postoperative pain scores 24 hours after surgery. At one hour and 12 hours postoperatively the effect was less certain. Nicotine appeared not to reduce use of opioids at 60 minutes or 24 hours, neither was there evidence that it reduced sedation or vomiting. Nicotine was associated with higher risk of nausea than placebo, and this may limit its use. There was not enough data to evaluate the effects of nicotine use on other side effects associated with opioids, including respiratory depression, or the effects of nicotine use on length of hospital stay following surgery. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low or very low quality largely because of problems with the way that the studies were designed, which could have exaggerated the results, because there was insufficient data in many of the analyses to be certain about the size of the average effect and because the results of some of the studies varied substantially.
In nine clinical trials men were either given a dummy tablet (placebo, inactive drug), an alpha blocker for one to three days (in one study up to a maximum of eight days and in another for 32 days) or no treatment before the catheter was removed. In ideal circumstances, neither patients nor doctors knew which type of tablet was given, to prevent the bias in reporting the results. The results suggested that alpha blocker treatment increased the chances of successful catheter removal and return to urination although the overall scientific evidence available to support this was limited. Four different alpha blockers were tested (alfuzosin, tamsulosin, doxazosin and silodosin). Their results were similar except for doxazosin which did not seem to make a significant difference. Side effects caused by alpha blockers were few and comparable to placebo or no treatment, though this evidence was limited. They included retrograde ejaculation, dizziness, low blood pressure, fainting, sleepiness, feeling unwell and headache. There was some evidence to say that alpha blockers also reduce the risk of suffering another (recurrent) episode of urinary retention after successful catheter removal, though it remains unclear whether they reduce the need for future surgery on the prostate. It is therefore unclear whether, or for how long, alpha blocker treatment should be continued after successful catheter removal and whether the costs of alpha blocker treatment in such situations are justified. Further research is needed to answer these questions.
We identified five studies conducted in the UK that tested whether methods to change consultation length for family doctors provides any benefit. The studies were conducted in single or multiple practices, and the number of appointments ranged from 200 to 2957 consultations. Four studies compared a change in appointment times from 5 to 15 minutes, and one study compared short versus long consultations with or without treatment for patients with no diagnosis. All studies tested short-term changes in the consultation time allocated to each patient. Our confidence in the results of these studies is very low. Consequently, we are not certain whether changing appointment slots leads to an actual increase of the length of the consultation, number of referrals and investigations requested by the doctor, and number of medications prescribed. Likewise, it is unclear whether patients are more satisfied with the health care they receive when appointments are longer. None of the studies reported on the resources associated with lengthening appointments. There is currently not enough evidence to say whether altering the amount of time that doctors consult with patients provides benefits or not.
In this review, we wanted to find whether lay health workers can effectively identify and treat moderate to severe wasting in children aged five years or younger. We looked for studies that evaluated the effect of using lay health workers in the community compared with health professionals working in health facilities. We included seven studies in this review. Six studies were from African countries, and one study was from Pakistan. Six studies included children with severe wasting, and one included children with moderate wasting. In some studies, lay health workers identified children with wasting and then referred them to clinics for treatment. In the other studies, lay health workers also treated the children.
All studies compared lay health workers with health professionals. No studies included children younger than 6 months old. Identification and referral of children with wasting by lay health professionals, compared with treatment by health professionals after self-referral, may make little or no difference to the number of children who recover from moderate or severe wasting.
Identification and treatment of children with severe wasting by lay health workers, compared with treatment by health professionals after identification and referral by lay health workers:
• may slightly reduce response to treatment (60 fewer children per 1000 responding to treatment);
• may have little or no effect on the number of children who gain weight;
• probably has little or no effect on the amount of weight gained;
• probably has little or no effect on the number of children who relapse;
• probably has little or no effect on the number of children who are transferred to inpatient care;
• probably has little or no effect on the number of children who drop out of treatment; and
• may have little or no effect on the number of children who die. We searched for studies that had been published up to 24 September 2021.
In July 2018 we searched for clinical trials where mirtazapine was used to treat fibromyalgia in adults. We found three studies with 606 participants. Studies were seven to 13 weeks long. They compared mirtazapine 15 mg to 45 mg daily against a fake medication (placebo). There was no difference between mirtazapine and placebo for any primary outcome: mirtazapine and placebo reduced pain by 50% in two of 10 people (low-quality evidence). Only one single serious adverse event was available for evaluation of safety (very low-quality evidence). Three of 10 participants with mirtazapine and two of 10 participants with placebo dropped out of the trial due to side effects (low-quality evidence).
Mirtazapine reduced pain by 30% or more in five out of 10 people, compared with three out of 10 with placebo (low-quality evidence). It was also better for average pain intensity (low-quality evidence) and sleep problems (low-quality evidence). Mirtazapine was not better than placebo in reducing fatigue, depression, or improving health-related quality of life (low-quality evidence). Mirtazapine and placebo were no different in how many participants experienced a side effect (low-quality evidence). People dropped out at the same rate with mirtazapine and placebo or because they felt the drug did not work (low-quality evidence). For some side effects, mirtazapine was worse than placebo. This was true for drowsiness (4 out of 10 with mirtazapine, 1 out of 10 with placebo), weight gain (2 out of 10 with mirtazapine, 0 out of 10 with placebo), and high liver enzymes (1 out of 10 with mirtazapine, 0 out of 10 with placebo) (low-quality evidence). Two of the studies were of poor quality. We rated the quality of the evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. We judged that the evidence was mostly of low-quality, which means that while the research provides some indication of the likely effect, the true effect may be substantially different. The main issues were poor study quality, decisions about the types of people included in the studies, risk of important information not being published, and sometimes low numbers of events.
We included four trials (145 adults). Two trials compared insulin to either no treatment for two months (seven participants) or to a placebo (dummy drug with no active medication) for one year (61 participants). These trials, along with a third trial lasting two years (67 adults), also compared insulin (given via a syringe) to repaglinide tablets. The fourth trial (20 participants) compared the long-acting insulin glargine to short-term neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin over a 12-week period. We found results for our primary outcomes of blood glucose levels, lung function and nutritional status and our secondary outcomes of pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of disease), complications and quality of life. We could only analyse limited results and did not find evidence that showed that any one treatment was better than another. Our analysis did not show that either insulin or repaglinide made any difference to any of our outcomes compared to placebo or no treatment at any time point. Similarly, most of our results did not show whether insulin or repaglinide was better, but the evidence was a little stronger that there was no difference in lung function, nutritional status or blood glucose levels at 12 months. Similarly, the evidence was not strong enough to show if there is any difference between glargine and neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin for any of our outcome measures. None of the trials reported if there were any deaths.
Given the treatment burden already experienced by people with CF, tablets may be a welcome alternative to injecting insulin. Longer-term trials with larger numbers of people are still needed to see how controlling CFRD affects lung function. Investigators should also assess how many people keep to their treatment plan when comparing insulin to tablets. Research should look at using the drugs by themselves or together with insulin to enhance insulin action, especially those agents with additional anti-inflammatory potential. We had some concerns about the quality of the evidence; mainly that there would be bias because clinicians probably knew in advance which treatment group the next person was going to be put into (e.g. healthier participants might be put into one group to show better results for that treatment) or bias from people taking part knowing which treatment group they were in (e.g. insulin via a syringe or repaglinide as a tablet). There may also be bias because results may only be selectively reported. We had some concerns that the analysis would not be precise due to small numbers of participants and low event rates. Finally, there may be bias in the results as the amounts of insulin and repaglinide given were not comparable.
We found five studies involving 168 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy or polyneuropathy. Studies were randomised and double-blind, but all had one or more sources of potential major bias that could lead to overestimation of efficacy. It was not possible to combine information from the different studies, but individually they indicated some benefit from imipramine (usually at a dose between 100 mg and 150 mg daily) compared with placebo, at the expense of increased adverse events.
There was too little information, which was of inadequate quality, to be sure that imipramine works as a pain medicine in neuropathic pain due to diabetes or due to damage to multiple nerves. There was no information about other types of neuropathic pain. Other medicines have been shown to be effective.
However, before confident claims can be made, much more research on strategies to deal with sexual problems should be undertaken. Sildenafil may be a useful option in the treatment of sexual problems in men with schizophrenia, but this conclusion is based only on one small, short trial. Switching to olanzapine may improve sexual functioning in men and women, but the trial assessing this was small. Further well designed trials and research, which investigate the effects of dose reduction, drug holidays, taking drugs such as Viagra TM, and switching antipsychotic medication, are much needed.

We included five studies and two ongoing studies. The five included studies involved a total of 2655 participants and were conducted in one high-income country (USA) and two lower-middle-income countries (Bangladesh and Pakistan). Three studies were conducted in hospital settings, one in schools, and one at a military training centre. Three studies included children under five years of age, one school-aged children, and one adult participants. Two studies assessed the effect of vitamin C supplementation for pneumonia prevention; and three studies assessed the effect of vitamin C supplementation in pneumonia treatment. The doses of vitamin C supplementation used were 125 mg, 200 mg, 1 g and 2 g. Two studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Three studies did not report funding sources. We assessed the rate of pneumonia (incidence), how common pneumonia is (prevalence), numbers of deaths from pneumonia (mortality), and unintended and harmful outcomes (adverse effects) associated with vitamin C for preventing pneumonia. Only one study (674 participants) reported incidence, and one study reported one adverse effect (hives) associated with vitamin C for preventing pneumonia. No study reported on prevalence or mortality. Evidence was insufficient to determine the effect of vitamin C for preventing pneumonia.
We also assessed how long people were ill (duration of illness), how many people were cured, mortality, and adverse effects associated with the use of vitamin C as a treatment for pneumonia. Only one study reported duration of illness. No studies reported cure rates or adverse effects. Evidence was insufficient to determine the effect of vitamin C for treating pneumonia. We judged the included studies to be at overall high or unclear risk of bias. The evidence certainty was very low due to study limitations, variations amongst the studies, small sample sizes and uncertainty of estimates.
Overall certainty of the evidence was moderate (for propionyl-L-carnitine compared with placebo) or low (for propionyl-L-carnitine compared with L-carnitine) because of differences between studies such as participants coming from different countries and centres, participants with and without diabetes, use of different treadmill protocols, small numbers of participants, and short follow-up times, respectively. When propionyl-L-carnitine was compared with placebo, improvement in walking distance was mild to moderate and safety profiles were similar, with overall moderate certainty of the evidence. Although in clinical practice, propionyl-L-carnitine might be considered a useful alternative medicine or addition to standard treatment when such therapies are contraindicated or ineffective, we found no clinical trial evidence comparing propionyl-L-carnitine with standard treatment to directly support such use.
This systematic review found seven randomised controlled trials with a total of 1125 participants (441 stapled, 684 handsewn) comparing these two methods. The leak rate from the bowel join for stapled anastomosis was 2.5%, significantly lower than handsewn (6%). For the sub-group of 825 cancer patients in four studies, stapled join again has fewer leaks compared with handsewn, being 1.3% and 6.7% respectively. For the sub-group of 264 non-cancer patients in three studies, there were no differences for the reported outcomes. This sub-group included patients with Crohn's disease. Overall, there was no significant difference in the other outcomes of stricture, bleeding from the join, time to perform the join, re-operation, mortality, intra-abdominal abscess, wound infection and length of stay, although these were not consistently reported.
The reason why a handsewn bowel join is more likely to leak is unclear. Possible explanations include less handling of the bowel, decreased spillage of bowel content during surgery, and uniform closure of all the staples using a stapler. This review did not compare different sewing materials or methods. The trials included in this review were performed from the early 1980's to 2009 involving six countries. The studies in Crohn's disease were more recent but the combined number of patients was too small to summarise outcomes. More randomised controlled trials comparing the two surgical techniques in Crohn's disease are needed.
The evidence is up-to-date to January 2021. We included studies that investigated the treatment or prevention of heavy menstrual bleeding or pain related to IUD use. The treatment could be compared with another medicine, no treatment or a placebo (dummy medicine). This review includes 21 studies with 3689 women. Eleven studies investigated treatment, while 10 looked at prevention of heavy bleeding and pain. Most of the evidence was obtained from single studies with few participants. We have little to no confidence in the results of the studies. Our confidence is limited because some studies involved only a few people, had varied interventions or had no clear reports on how the study was conducted.  Vitamin B1 may reduce the duration of bleeding, number of spotting days and number of pads used per day while. Mefenamic acid may reduce the volume but not the duration of bleeding when compared to tranexamic acid. Naproxen may not reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding associated with copper IUD. Among levonorgestrel IUD users, ulipristal may not reduce the duration of bleeding. In one study with an unknown IUD type, we found that mefenamic acid may not reduce the volume of menstrual bleeding.  Treatment with tranexamic acid and sodium diclofenac may not reduce the occurrence of painful menstruation associated with copper IUD. Naproxen may reduce pain associated with an unknown IUD type  Tolfenamic acid may prevent heavy menstrual bleeding while ibuprofen made little to no difference to the volume and duration of menstrual bleeding when compared to placebo. Aspirin in comparison to paracetamol, may not prevent the occurrence of heavy menstrual bleeding. Studies on tranexamic acid, estradiol, naproxen and mifepristone could not tell us whether they prevented heavy menstrual bleeding associated with levonorgestrel IUD use.  Tolfenamic acid and ibuprofen may not be effective to prevent painful menstruation compared with placebo. Heavy menstrual bleeding among copper IUD users may be treated with vitamin B and mefenamic acid while tranexamic acid and diclofenac may not alleviate painful menstruation. As for levonorgestrel IUD users, ulipristal may not reduce or prevent heavy menstrual bleeding. Tolfenamic acid may prevent heavy menstrual bleeding but not pain associated with levonorgestrel IUD. Our confidence in the evidence is low to very low. More studies are needed in the future to generate higher-quality evidence regarding effective medicines to treat and prevent heavy menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation associated with IUD use. Evidence from further studies is likely to change our results.
We wanted to find out whether physical activity intervention improves symptoms, quality of life and abdominal pain in adults diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. We searched for all available randomised controlled trials to help answer this question. A randomised controlled trial is a type of study in which participants are assigned randomly to one of two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that a fair comparison is made between new and existing treatments. We searched nine electronic databases and trial registries for all randomised controlled trials involving adults (18 years or older) diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome that compared a physical activity intervention with no physical activity intervention in adults diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. We compared and summarised the results of these trials and rated our confidence in the overall evidence, based on factors such as study methods and the amount of information they provided. We found 11 randomised controlled trials involving 622 people with irritable bowel syndrome. The biggest trial was in 102 people and the smallest was in 20 people. Six trials were conducted in high-income countries worldwide and two were conducted in a low- to middle-income country. One study included people with irritable bowel syndrome where constipation was the main stool pattern, two included people where diarrhoea was the main stool pattern and five included people with a mixed stool pattern.
Five trials assessed a yoga physical activity intervention, three assessed advice to increase physical activity levels, two assessed treadmill exercise, and one assessed a Qigong (breathing and slow movements) intervention. Seven trials involved a 12-week intervention period, two involved an eight-week period and one a six-week period. The longest trial lasted six months. Physical activity interventions may improve IBS symptoms compared to usual care but the evidence is very uncertain. The average improvement in symptom score was approximately 69 points but could be as high as 106 and as low as 31 points. A change in symptoms score of 50 points would be considered meaningful for most people. Our findings suggest physical activity interventions may provide both important and non-important improvements in IBS symptoms.
Physical activity interventions result in little or no difference in quality of life and abdominal pain.
We could not draw any conclusions about unwanted effects reported by participants because very few trials reported these. We have very little confidence in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how the trials were conducted, which included that many trials did not report all their results or reported new ones. The evidence is up-to-date to 5 November 2021.
We found 10 randomised controlled trials including 960 women; the evidence is current to November 2016. Three studies assessed mifepristone. Moderate-quality evidence shows that mifepristone relieves dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) in women with endometriosis. Evidence suggests that if 40% of women taking placebo experience dysmenorrhoea, then between 3% and 10% of women taking mifepristone will do so. Low-quality evidence suggests that mifepristone also relieves dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse). However, amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual periods) and hot flushes were common side effects of mifepristone. Nearly 90% of the mifepristone group had amenorrhoea, and 24% had hot flushes, although researchers reported only one event of each (1%) among women taking placebo. Evidence was insufficient to show differences in rates of nausea, vomiting, or fatigue, if present.
Comparisons of different doses of mifepristone were inconclusive, although evidence suggests that the 2.5 mg dose may be less effective than higher doses.
Other studies assessed other progesterone receptor modulators. Researchers compared gestrinone versus other treatments (danazol or leuprolin), ulipristal versus leuprolide acetate, and asoprisnil verus placebo. However, evidence was insufficient to allow firm conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of these interventions. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations were serious risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of methods and high or unclear rates of attrition in most studies), very serious imprecision (associated with low event rates and wide confidence intervals), and indirectness (outcome assessed in a select subgroup of participants).
We systematically searched various medical databases to determine whether veno-venous bypass is required routinely during liver transplantation. We identified a total of three randomised clinical trials with high risk of systematic error and high risk of random errors which compared veno-venous bypass (n = 65) with no veno-venous bypass (n = 66). None of the trials reported patient or graft survival. There were no differences regarding kidney failure or blood transfusion requirements between the two groups. None of the trials reported on the complications related to veno-venous bypass or the requirement of veno-venous bypass in the control group. We also identified one trial with high risk of systematic error and high risk of random errors which compared needle technique (percutaneous approach) (n = 20) with open technique (n =19) of veno-venous bypass. The patient or graft survival was not reported in this trial. There was no difference in veno-venous bypass related complications between the two groups. The operating time was shorter in the percutaneous technique group. There is currently no evidence to support the routine use of veno-venous bypass in liver transplantation.
We looked at studies that had compared two approaches to promoting physical activity (face-to-face with a professional versus using technologies that enabled remote prescription) to decide which approach was better. We know from other work that both approaches are successful. We found only one study with 225 apparently healthy adults in the medical literature to answer our question. Therefore, we remain unclear about which approach is best for promoting physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness. We are also unable to comment authoritatively on adverse events and the influence of the delivery method.
We found four studies that included a total of 2199 teachers. They evaluated three types of work changes. One intervention consisted of changes in teachers' tasks such as redesigning work, establishing flexible work schedules and redesigning the work environment. Another intervention consisted of a school-wide coaching support network alongside individual training for teachers, in order to deliver a child development programme. The third intervention consisted of several components: performance bonus pay, job promotion opportunities and mentoring. Changes in tasks of teachers
In one study with 961 teachers in eight schools, changes in tasks of teachers combined with stress management training resulted in a small reduction in work stress levels after one year follow-up compared to no intervention. There was also a small increase in work ability, meaning how well a worker is able to perform his or her work. However, the authors did not report how they changed teachers' tasks, limiting the results' usefulness elsewhere.
Changing organisational features
There were two studies of school-wide coaching support combined with teacher training. In one study with 43 schools and 59 participating teachers, there was no considerable effect on anxiety or depression after two years follow-up compared to no intervention. In the other study with 18 schools and 77 participating teachers, there was no considerable effect on burnout or emotional ability after six months follow-up compared to no intervention. Burnout is a state of prolonged severe stress. Emotional ability means understanding other people’s emotions, and understanding and controlling ones own emotions. Both studies had a small number of participants.
Multicomponent programme
In one study with 34 schools and 1102 teachers, the intervention included performance bonus pay, job promotion opportunities and mentoring. After three years follow-up and compared to 300 similar schools, there was a moderate reduction in resignation of teachers in the intervention schools. However, authors reported results only for eight schools. The quality of the evidence was low for all interventions because the authors did not report all the results and lost many participants for follow-up. All included studies also had interventions directed at individual teachers combined with changes at schools. Therefore, new and better quality studies directed at schools will probably change the conclusions of this review. Changing the way teachers' work is organised at schools may improve the teachers' wellbeing and may reduce teacher resignations. We need better-designed research in the development and testing of work changes in schools. In future studies, whether work at schools is changed or not should be determined according to chance. These studies should also have several hundred participants.
This review update included 94 randomised controlled studies: 42 of rTMS, 11 of CES, 36 of tDCS two of RINCE, two of tRNS and one study which evaluated both tDCS and rTMS. rTMS applied to the motor cortex may lead to small, short-term reductions in pain but these effects are not likely to be clinically important. tDCS may reduce pain when compared with sham but for rTMS and tDCS our estimates of benefit are likely to be exaggerated by the small number of participants in each of the studies and limitations in the way the studies were conducted. Low- or very low-quality evidence suggests that low-frequency rTMS and rTMS that is applied to prefrontal areas of the brain are not effective. Low-quality evidence does not suggest that CES is an effective treatment for chronic pain. For all forms of stimulation the evidence is not conclusive and there is substantial uncertainty about the possible benefits and harms of the treatment. Of the studies that clearly reported side effects, short-lived and minor side effects such as headache, nausea and skin irritation were usually reported both with real and sham stimulation. Two cases of seizure were reported following real rTMS. Our conclusions for rTMS, CES, tDCS, and RINCE have not changed substantially in this update. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. We considered all of the evidence to be of low or very low quality, mainly because of bias in the studies that can lead to unreliable results and the small size of the studies, which makes them imprecise.
Many trials had a high or unclear overall risk of bias. There were problems with the quality of the evidence, which was judged to be very low for all outcomes we considered across all the trials. This was because the trials were only small and if they compared a second treatment after the first, they did not leave enough time for the effects of the first treatment to clear. Also, people taking part had previously been treated with different glucocorticoids. There is not enough evidence to show which steroid replacement treatment schedule results in better outcomes or which is the most effective form of steroid replacement therapy in CAH for adults and children. Large, well-designed trials are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of different steroid replacement therapies for treating 21-hydroxylase deficiency CAH in children and adults. A longer duration of follow-up is needed to monitor biochemical and clinical outcomes.
Seven randomised controlled trials conducted in the USA, UK, Canada and Australia related to a range of conditions and target populations. They provided some evidence of efficacy. Peer support telephone calls may increase mammography screening in women over 40 years, may help patients change their diet and cease smoking after a heart attack; and may help reduce depressive symptoms among mothers with postnatal depression. Findings need to be interpreted cautiously. There is a need for well designed randomised controlled studies to clarify which elements of peer telephone interventions work best to improve health and health-related behaviour.
Ten randomised trials involving 1139 women met the inclusion criteria for the review. Nine studies compared heparin (alone or in combination with dipyridamole) with no treatment; and one compared triazolopyrimidine with placebo. The most commonly recognised side effect for women related to this treatment was mild skin bruising. To date, important information about serious adverse infant and long-term childhood outcomes with using anti-clotting medications is unavailable. Further research is required.
We carried out a comprehensive search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in participants diagnosed with Frey's syndrome. We planned to include trials in which participants received any intervention compared to no treatment (observation) or an alternative intervention, with or without a second active treatment. Despite extensive searching, we were unable to identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. There is no high-quality evidence to establish which type of treatment is most effective for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. High-quality clinical trials in this area should be urgently conducted. Studies should investigate all possibly effective treatments (such as anticholinergics, antiperspirants and botulinum toxin) compared to control groups using different treatments or placebo. Subjective (patient) assessment of Frey's syndrome should be one of the outcome measures used. This review is up to date to 28 April 2014.
This systematic review examined randomised controlled trials comparing two commonly available combinations administered at a fixed dose through a single inhaler, fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol. We included five studies which recruited 5537 people. The trials were generally well designed but only recruited adults and adolescents and not children. Participants were already taking regular inhaled steroids before the studies commenced and had mild or moderate asthma based on tests of their airway. We found that the number of people who required treatment with oral steroids and admission to hospital was similar between the treatments, but due to the statistical uncertainty of this result we could not rule out important differences in favour of either drug combination. Additional trials would enable us to draw more reliable conclusions about how well these drugs work compared with each other. We also looked at serious adverse events. Again, the results did not indicate that one combination was clearly better than the other, but again these results were imprecise so we cannot be certain. However, lung function and rescue medication use were similar between the treatments. We could not assess the relative effects of these drugs on mortality because there were so few deaths which leads to statistical uncertainty; out of the five studies, one person died. Quality of life was measured in different ways in two studies and we could not determine how the treatments compared in this respect. Further studies are needed to strengthen and better explain these findings. In particular studies which assess the effects of these therapies in children and studies which measure quality of life are a priority.
The evidence is current to May 2014. This review includes 23 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1309 participants whose chronic low back pain was evaluated with nerve blocks or other diagnostic tests. Both men and women, with a mean age of 50.6 years, were included. Patients with a positive response to a diagnostic block or to discography were given radiofrequency denervation, a placebo or a comparison treatment. No high-quality evidence shows that radiofrequency denervation provides pain relief for patients with chronic low back pain. Similarly, no convincing evidence suggests that this treatment improves function. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that radiofrequency denervation might better relieve facet joint pain and improve function over the short term when compared with placebo. Evidence of very low to low quality shows that radiofrequency denervation might relieve facet joint pain as well as steroid injections. For patients with disc pain, only small long-term effects on pain relief and improved function are shown. For patients with SI joint pain, radiofrequency denervation had no effect over the short term and a smaller effect (based on one study) one to six months after treatment when compared with placebo. For low back pain suspected to arise from other sources, the results were inconclusive. Radiofrequency denervation is an invasive procedure that can cause a variety of complications. The studies in this review were not of adequate quality and size to document how often complications occur. Given the poor quality of the evidence, large, high-quality studies are urgently needed to determine whether radiofrequency denervation is safe and effective.
The efficacy of galantamine has been tested in two randomised controlled trials for the treatment of vascular dementia and for a mixed population of Alzheimer's disease patients with evidence of cerebrovascular disease on scanning. The rationale behind its use is to correct the cholinergic deficit seen in vascular dementia. This review found evidence of benefit for galantamine compared with placebo in measures of cognition in both studies. Both studies indicated higher rates of nausea and vomiting in patients taking galantamine compared with placebo.
We looked for evidence from studies that assessed one medication versus another to treat seizures in newborns, studies that evaluated whether maintenance doses of anti-seizure medication should be continued or not, and studies that assessed whether to treat seizures that were identified only on EEG. We searched for studies that evaluated the effects of medications on treating seizures in newborns. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We identified 18 trials (including 1342 newborns).
Phenobarbital is probably more effective than levetiracetam in achieving seizure control in newborns. However, we are uncertain about the effect of phenobarbital on other outcomes such as death before discharge, requirement for invasive ventilation, sleepiness and epilepsy after discharge.
Maintenance therapy with anti-seizure medication during hospital stay compared to no maintenance therapy may or may not result in better outcomes for newborns. Similarly, treating seizures only identified on EEG may or may not result in better outcomes. We are moderately confident that phenobarbital is better than levetiracetam in achieving seizure control. The confidence for the estimates of all other comparisons and outcomes is low to very low. More studies are needed to synthesise strong evidence on medications to treat seizures in newborns. Evidence is up-to-date as of June 2023.
We wanted to know if COVID-19 specific monoclonal antibodies are an effective treatment for COVID-19. We looked at whether they:
- reduced the number of deaths from any cause;
- improved symptoms or made them worse;
- increased admissions to hospital; and
- caused any serious or other unwanted effects. We searched for studies that investigated one or more monoclonal antibodies to treat people with confirmed COVID-19 compared with placebo (sham treatment), another treatment or no treatment. Studies could take place anywhere globally and include participants of any age, gender or ethnicity, with mild, moderate or severe COVID-19.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size. We found six active studies including a total of 17,495 people. Four studies investigated non-hospitalised people with no symptoms or mild COVID-19. Two studies investigated hospitalised people with moderate to severe COVID-19. Studies took place across the world. Three studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The monoclonal antibodies they studied were bamlanivimab, etesevimab, casirivimab and imdevimab, sotrovimab, regdanvimab. We did not identify data for mortality at 60 days and quality of life. One study investigated different doses of bamlanivimab (465 people), compared to placebo.
We don’t know whether bamlanivimab:
- increases or reduces the number of deaths because no participants died within 30 days of treatment;
- causes more or fewer serious unwanted effects because there were few events.
Bamlanivimab may reduce the number of admissions to hospital within 30 days of treatment compared to placebo.
- May cause slightly fewer unwanted effects than placebo.
- We did not find data for improved symptoms or worsened symptoms.
One study investigated a combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab (1035 people), compared to placebo.
- Bamlanivimab and etesevimab may reduce the number of deaths and admissions to hospital.
- May cause slightly more unwanted effects.
- May cause more serious unwanted effects.
For treatment with bamlanivimab alone or in combination with etesevimab we did not find data for improved symptoms or worsened symptoms.
One study (phase 1/2 with 799 people) investigated different doses of casirivimab combined with imdevimab, compared to placebo.
- Casirivimab combined with imdevimab may reduce the number of hospital admissions or death.
- We don't know whether casirivimab and imdevimab causes more unwanted (grades 3 and 4) and serious unwanted effects than placebo because there were too few deaths to allow us to make a judgment.
-  We did not find data for the number of people who died at day 30 and development of severe symptoms.
- We did not include results from phase 3 (5607 people) of this study, because of high risk of bias, as it was not clear which participants were included in the analysis.
One study (583 people) investigated sotrovimab, compared to placebo.
We don't know whether sotrovimab:
- increases or reduces the number of deaths and people requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or dying, because there were too few deaths to allow us to make a judgment.
- Sotrovimab may reduce the number of people requiring oxygen, unwanted (grades 3 to 4) and serious unwanted effects;
- may have little or no effect on unwanted effects (all grades).
Another study (327 people) investigated different doses of regdanvimab (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg), compared to placebo.
- Regdanvimab at either dose may reduce the number of admissions to hospital or death.
- May increase unwanted events (grades 3 to 4).
- Regdanvimab at a dose of 80 mg/kg may reduce unwanted effects (all grades) and 40 mg/kg may have little to no effect.
- We don't know whether regdanvimab increases or decreases the number of deaths, requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, and serious unwanted effects,  because there were too few events to allow us to make a judgment. One study (314 people) investigated bamlanivimab compared to placebo.
- We don’t know whether bamlanivimab increases or decreases the number of deaths due to any cause up to 30 or 90 days after treatment because there were too few deaths to allow us to make a judgment (6 deaths with bamlanivimab and 4 deaths with placebo in 314 people).

Three trials examined the betamimetic drug ritodrine plus magnesium compared with ritodrine alone. The trials reported on adverse side effects, with inconsistency between the trials as to which treatment gave fewer severe side effects. Other outcomes were either not reported or not clearly different between treatment groups.
One trial looked at ritodrine plus indomethacin versus ritodrine alone. There were no clear differences between groups for serious newborn ill health. Results for other outcomes were not clearly different. There were no clear differences between groups receiving ritodrine plus progesterone compared with ritodrine alone for most outcomes reported, although the time between giving the drugs and the birth was increased in the group receiving the combination of tocolytics. For other combinations of tocolytic agents, results did not demonstrate differences between groups. There were no trials of combination regimens using widely used tocolytic agents, such as calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) and oxytocin receptor antagonists (atosiban).
Due to insufficient evidence, it is unclear if combination tocolytic regimens are more or less effective than using a single tocolytic drug, or if they have more adverse effects. Some widely used tocolytic drugs have not been examined in trials as part of combination regimens, so further research is needed.
This systematic review evaluates the effects of various herbal preparations (including single herbs or mixtures of different herbs) for treating people with type 2 diabetes. The review shows that some herbal medicines lower blood sugar and relieving symptoms in patients with diabetes. However, the methodological quality of the clinical trials evaluating these herbs is generally poor. The analyses also indicate that trials with positive findings are more likely to be associated with exaggerated effects. However, the trials did not report significant adverse effects. In conclusion, herbal medicines should not be recommended for routine use in diabetic patients of type 2 diabetes until we get scientifically sound trials. Testing the herbs in larger, well-designed trials is needed in order to establish the necessary evidence for their use.
The number and size of the trials investigating adjunctive corticosteroids for HIV-infected patients co-infected with PCP is small (the six trials included in the meta-analysis comprised 242 individuals in the intervention groups and 247 individuals in the control groups; the trial on infants comprised 47 individuals in the intervention group and 53 in the control group). Follow-up ranged from three to 14 months. The evidence from this review was of high quality for mortality and of moderate quality for need for mechanical ventilation and suggests a beneficial effect for adult patients with substantial hypoxaemia. For infants (18 months or younger) with HIV and suspected PCP there is insufficient evidence on whether the effect of adjunctive corticosteroids could improve survival (the confidence interval for the estimate of effect is wide, includes both clinically relevant benefit and harm and is of moderate quality).
Searching the literature we found 63 articles assessing post-caesarean pain but only 13 studies met our inclusion criteria, of which only eight studies (involving 962 women) reported on outcomes that we assessed in this review. Of the eight trials contributing data to our review, only four trials had low risk of bias. All of the included studies involved small numbers of women (40 to 136 women).
We compared non-opioid, opioid and combination oral tablets with placebo or no treatment. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of additional pain killers (tablets or injections) among women who took opioid or non-opioid or combination pain killers in comparison to placebo. There was also insufficient evidence to establish the effect of opioid versus non-opioid drugs and opioid versus combination drugs on requirement for additional pain relief. When assessing different non-opioid drugs individually, we found some evidence that gabapentin resulted in less need for additional pain relief in comparison to placebo, but the analysis of data for other tablets (celexocib, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, paracetamol) gave more uncertain results. The use of paracetamol plus codeine resulted in less need for additional pain relief in comparison to placebo. We found that high and low dose of gabapentin, and high dose of ketoprofen were more effective than placebo in relation to the need for additional pain relief. On the other hand, low dose of ketoprofen as well as high and low dose of tramadol did not differ with placebo with in effect on the need for additional pain relief. However, it is important to note that these additional analyses (i.e. different drugs and different doses) are based on relatively few studies (one to two trials) and numbers of women (40 to 136).
Women developed more side effects including nausea, vomiting and drowsiness with the use of opioid, non-opioid or combination painkillers in comparison to placebo or no treatment. All trials used additional pain relief as a standard and for breakthrough pain and they all used different drugs.
No studies reported on the following outcomes: adequate pain relief, number of days in hospital post operatively, re-hospitalisation due to incisional pain, fully breast feeding on discharge, mixed feeding at discharge, maternal postpartum depression and cost-effectiveness of the studied interventions.
Due to limited data available no conclusions can be made regarding the safest and the most effective form of oral analgesia for post-caesarean pain. Further studies are necessary. More research is needed to compare different types of pain killers and in relation to different outcomes such as safety, efficacy and cost.
The review authors searched the medical literature in order to clarify the role of RFA for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and to compare its benefits and harms with no treatment, placebo (a pretend treatment), or other treatments (such as hepatic resection, percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI), laser or microwave ablation, and liver transplantation). We looked for randomised clinical trials (where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatments groups) of people with hepatocellular carcinoma who were able to receive RFA. Evidence is current to September 2013. We found no trials comparing RFA versus no intervention, placebo, chemotherapy, or liver transplantation.
The review authors found moderate-quality evidence from two trials with low risk of bias (where there was a low risk of a flaw in study design, method of collecting or interpreting results) randomising 578 patients suggesting that hepatic resection yielded better results regarding overall survival (the length of time that the patient remains alive), event-free survival (time that the person remains free of cancer or a certain symptom relating to cancer), and progression (time that the patient lives with cancer without it getting worse) compared with RFA. However, as resection is a more invasive procedure, resection has an eight times higher risk of major complications compared with RFA. Resected patients stayed twice as long in the hospital as the RFA patients. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that RFA prolongs survival and decreases recurrences (where the cancer returns) compared with PEI or PAI. This conclusion was based on data from six randomised clinical trials with 1088 participants. Some patients developed side effects such as fever, rash, and pain. These occurred at the same frequency in both treatment groups. We calculated the number of patients that would be required to judge a relative risk reduction (relative risk is a comparison of the risk of an event happening for one treatment group compared with another treatment group) for survival of 20%. The review authors found that for both comparisons, that is RFA versus PEI or PAI, and RFA versus resection, the number of patients in the included trials was too low to reach valid conclusions. No firm conclusion can be drawn from the comparison of RFA against other interventional techniques or combination approaches. The information provided by the single trials was limited. More randomised clinical trials with low risks of bias (that is low risks of systematic errors, leading to overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms) and low risk of play of chance (that is random errors, leading to overestimation or underestimation of benefits and harms) are required.
This review reports trials comparing fluvoxamine with other antidepressants for treatment of major depression. We found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to any other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of depression. However, there is evidence of differing side-effect profiles, especially when comparing gastrointestinal side effects between fluvoxamine and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations including these differences in side effect profiles.
This review demonstrates that this combined treatment also is effective within the high-risk group of patients undergoing surgery of the large bowel or rectum.
We included 51 studies that analysed a total of 5345 participants. The evidence in this review is up to date as of 28 September 2016. Generally study participants were children and adults who had gingivitis or periodontitis, were able to use usual tooth cleaning methods and were healthy. We did not exclude studies where some or all participants had medical conditions or special care needs as we considered the use of mouthrinses with chlorhexidine to be particularly relevant to them. The included studies assessed the effects of chlorhexidine mouthrinse used for at least 4 weeks in addition to conventional tooth cleaning on gingivitis in children and adults. There is high-quality evidence that the use of mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine in addition to usual toothbrushing and cleaning for 4 to 6 weeks or 6 months leads to a large reduction in the build-up of plaque. There is also high-quality evidence of a moderate reduction in gingivitis in people with a mild level of it, although because the level of disease was already low this is not considered clinically important. The nature of the available evidence does not allow us to determine the level of reduction of gingivitis in people with moderate to severe levels of it.
There was no evidence that one concentration or strength of chlorhexidine rinse was more effective than another.
Rinsing for 4 weeks or longer causes tooth staining, which requires scaling and polishing carried out by a dental professional. Other side effects have been reported, including build-up of calculus (tartar), temporary taste disturbance and temporary shedding of/damage to the lining of the mouth. One study was assessed as being at unclear risk of bias, with the remaining 50 being at high risk of bias, however this did not affect the quality assessments for gingivitis and plaque as we believe that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
.
The review includes two small randomised studies with a total of 30 people with schizophrenia who had also developed antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia. Participants in one study received either the anticholinergic drug procyclidine or isocarboxacid, an antidepressant drug. One participant group in the other study was withdrawn from the anticholinergic drug biperiden whereas the other group of participants continued taking biperiden. .
There were sparse findings from two small and poorly reported trials. It is uncertain whether giving anticholinergic drugs is helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia for people who are taking antipsychotic medication. It is also uncertain whether the withdrawal of anticholinergic medication improves the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. .
Available evidence is very low or low quality, limited, and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs or the withdrawal of these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia. To fully investigate whether the withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs has any positive effects for people with tardive dyskinesia, we need more high quality research data.
This plain language summary was adapted by the review authors from a summary originally written by Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation (mcpin.org).
The evidence is current to March 2015. Only one study met our criteria: it involved a total of 411 stroke patients aged 18 years and over who had received either motivational interviewing or usual care between five and 28 days after stroke; the follow-up period was 12 months. Motivational interviewing consisted of one session per week for four individual sessions, with each session lasting for 30 to 60 minutes. The evidence we found from a single study was insufficient to support the use of motivational interviewing for improving activities of daily living after stroke, but participants receiving motivational interviewing were more likely to have a normal mood than those who received usual care. We assessed the included study to be at some risk of bias in methodological quality, as blinding of investigators and participants was impossible.
However, from the small and inadequate amount of evidence available from eight trials involving 466 participants, this review found no benefit of corticosteroids on reducing the number of deaths or improving functional outcome in survivors.
We looked for evidence up to November 2015. We included 14 randomized studies (involving 565 participants). Thirteen studies compared people who received normal care with additional intravenous amino acids against people who received normal care but no amino acids (the control group). One study compared people who received fructose with those in a control group. Studies involved adults undergoing planned or emergency surgery. We did not include studies in which participants were deliberately kept cold during surgery, were receiving skin grafts or were under local anaesthetic. We can be certain that at the end of surgery, people receiving intravenous nutrients are up to a half-degree warmer than people receiving control (based on evidence from six studies involving 249 participants). However, there was more uncertainty about the effects of intravenous nutrients at other time points, with some studies suggesting that intravenous nutrients keep participants warmer and other studies reporting that participants were colder than those receiving the control. We are uncertain if keeping people up to half a degree warmer is important to those involved in caring for people who are having surgery. We are also uncertain if giving intravenous nutrients reduces the risk of people shivering (based on evidence from three studies involving 155 participants). Most of the evidence was moderate to low in quality. The methods used to assign participants to treatment groups was often inadequate or unclear, and we were uncertain if the people assessing outcomes were aware of which treatment group participants were in. This may have biased the results, but we are unsure what effect it may have had on results overall.
We wanted to know whether biomarkers as a point-of-care test used by primary care doctors can help decide whether to use antibiotics in people with airway infections.
We were interested in the effect of biomarker guidance on the number of prescriptions of antibiotics, patient recovery, hospital admissions, and risk of death. We searched for studies that investigated whether biomarkers used as point-of-care tests in primary care can be safely used to guide a doctor's decision whether to prescribe antibiotics.
We compared and summarised results of the studies, and rated our confidence of the evidence. We found 13 studies with a total of 10,535 participants who had symptoms of airway infections and who saw a doctor in a primary care setting for possible treatment.
Twelve studies investigated tests for the biomarker C-reactive protein, and one study investigated a test for the biomarker procalcitonin.
Use of tests for C-reactive protein probably reduces the number of patients given an antibiotic prescription, but differences in study design and where the studies took place meant that the precise effect is uncertain. Using these tests probably does not affect the number of patients that recover, and may not reduce the number of patients that feel satisfied with their treatment. C-reactive protein tests may not lead to an increase in deaths. This means the tests are probably safe when used to guide the prescription of antibiotics.
We do not know if procalcitonin tests have an effect on prescriptions of antibiotics, recovery, hospital admissions, or risk of death. We are moderately confident in the evidence for a reduction in antibiotics use with C-reactive protein tests. However, we are not confident in the evidence for a reduction in antibiotics use with procalcitonin, as we only found one study investigating the effect of procalcitonin in primary care.
New studies are unlikely to change our conclusion regarding the effect of the use of C-reactive protein on prescribing antibiotics, but more studies are needed to assess the potential for the procalcitonin point-of-care test. The evidence is current to June 2022.
Within the review we assessed 67 different tests, but no tests were consistently useful in telling us whether older people are drinking enough, or are dehydrated. Some tests did appear useful in some studies, and these promising tests should be re-checked to see whether they are useful in specific older populations. There was sufficient evidence to suggest that some tests should not be used to indicate dehydration. Tests that should not be used include dry mouth, feeling thirsty, heart rate, urine colour, and urine volume.
We found nine studies up to January 2017, involving 994 participants, that looked at the benefits of occupational therapy interventions for adults with stroke who had problems with activities of daily living. This is an update of the Cochrane review first published in 2006. We found that occupational therapy for people with stroke can improve their ability to carry out these daily activities and stop them deteriorating in those abilities. We found no evidence that occupational therapy reduced rates of death or the need to be cared for in an institution, or affected mood or distress of the participant. We did not collect data on carer-related outcomes or participant satisfaction with the service. There were few studies measuring our outcomes of interest and we judged the quality of the evidence to be of low-quality. Many of the studies did not report methods sufficiently clearly and it was not possible to mask the occupational therapy from the person giving or receiving the treatment; this could also have influenced the results in our studies. We did not have sufficient good-quality evidence to be certain of our results and we cannot be certain that future studies will not change these conclusions.
We wanted to find out the effects of cognitive behavioural therapy added to standard care for people with a first episode or recent onset of schizophrenia. We searched for studies that examined cognitive behavioural therapy given in addition to standard care (usually drugs) compared with standard care alone or other psychosocial interventions.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence. For example, some factors in the studies (such as too few participants or results not showing clear effects) were rated with a lower confidence in the evidence. We found 28 studies, of which 26 had usable data on 2407 participants with recent-onset or first-episode schizophrenia. The studies had a duration of between 26 and 52 weeks for the intervention phase and, in 18 studies, participants were contacted again to collect further data after the end of the treatment. The studies were conducted in the UK, Europe, Australia, Canada, USA and China. They were mainly funded by public institutions, and a small number also by pharmaceutical companies.
When looking at the results about one year after the start of the intervention, we found that CBT added to standard care:
- is more effective than control conditions in reducing the overall symptoms of schizophrenia
- is more effective than control conditions in reducing positive symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. hearing voices)
- is more effective than control conditions in reducing negative symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. apathy, loss of interest and motivation, lack of concentration)
- is more effective than control conditions in reducing depressive symptoms of schizophrenia
- is more effective than control conditions in improving the global state (number of participants with symptoms improvement, number of participants with symptoms worsening, scores on scales that measure the general level of symptoms of the participants)
- is more effective than control conditions in improving functioning (e.g. participating in social life, taking part in everyday activities). The certainty of the evidence is between moderate and very low, meaning that we have moderate to very little confidence in the effect estimates. This is due to the fact that, for some of the studies, the quality ('risk of bias') was low, and that the results of the various studies sometimes slightly differed from each other. Moreover, for some outcomes, the results were imprecise, and a limited number of participants contributed to the data. The evidence is up-to-date until March 2022.
We wanted to find out if CBT is effective and safe when used without medication for people with schizophrenia. We searched for studies that examined CBT given without antipsychotics compared with no specific treatment, antipsychotics, or CBT plus antipsychotics.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 4 studies that involved 300 participants with schizophrenia. Study duration was between 26 and 39 weeks for the intervention period, and participants were contacted again to collect further data between 26 and 104 weeks. The included studies were conducted in the UK and Australia, and were all sponsored by public institutions.
We found that compared to no specific treatment, CBT without antipsychotics may result in a reduction in overall symptoms (at least in the long term) and negative symptoms (e.g. apathy, loss of interest and motivation, lack of concentration). It may also result in better functioning and lower duration of hospital stay in comparison with no specific treatment.
CBT without antipsychotics may not differ from CBT plus antipsychotics in modifying overall symptoms of schizophrenia. CBT without antipsychotics may be less effective than CBT plus antipsychotics in reducing positive symptoms specifically (e.g. hearing voices), and may result in fewer adverse effects compared to CBT plus antipsychotics. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low, meaning that we have limited to very little confidence in the results. This is because study participants and therapists were aware of the treatment being received, which could have influenced the results. In addition, it was often the case that during the study participants received treatment with antipsychotics when this was not planned. Furthermore, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the numbers of included studies and study participants were too small to be certain about the results. The evidence is current to March 2022.
All the trials we found tested different interventions and measured their effects in different ways. Generally, the trials were small and there were problems with the way they were done, which reduced our confidence in the results. For some interventions, the quality of the evidence was so low that we could not draw any conclusions. For others, there was a mixture of positive and negative effects. Because of the amount and quality of the evidence we found, we cannot at the moment, identify any specific environmental or behavioural modifications for improving food and fluid intake in people with dementia.
The evidence is current to June 2021. We identified one randomised controlled trial (RCT) and three non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) with an observational design. The RCT was conducted in Italy and included 60 healthy adults with a follow-up of six months. The NRSIs included more than 450,000 participants (either health professionals from the USA or adults (volunteers) from the general population from the UK) and reported a maximum follow-up of more than 25 years. In the NRSIs, the lowest median gluten intake was 2.6 g/day and the highest was 9.4 g/day (thereby, 1 g/day of gluten intake is equivalent to half a slice of white bread). The RCT compared a gluten-free with a usual diet. Our results suggest that it is unclear whether gluten intake is associated with all-cause mortality. Furthermore, our findings suggest no association between gluten intake and both cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction. A lower compared with a higher gluten intake may be associated with a slightly increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes — a major cardiovascular risk factor. These findings were independent of age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), family history of diabetes, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, menopausal status and postmenopausal hormone use, oral contraceptive use, multivitamin use, total energy intake, and intakes of magnesium, folic acid and cereal fibre.
The results from the only published RCT suggested that it is unclear whether gluten intake affects systolic blood pressure. Moreover, in this RCT no differences between a gluten-free and usual diet were found for other cardiovascular risk factors including diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein levels and BMI.
No study reported data on adverse events, quality of life or on other health-relevant outcomes. The certainty of evidence in this review was low to very low. The studies had several methodological flaws. Taking into account that the majority of the participants from the NRSIs were health professionals, the applicability to the general population is also questionable. Given the limited findings from this review predominantly based on observational studies, no recommendations for practice can be made.
This Cochrane review assessed the effects of six-month regimens for treating people with TBM compared with longer regimens. Cochrane researchers examined the available evidence up to 31 March 2016 and they included 18 studies. None of the included studies directly compared people with TBM treated for six months with people with TBM treated for longer. Two of the included studies analysed two groups of participants treated for six months and longer than six months. Therefore, the review authors included information from seven groups of people treated for six months (458 people), 12 groups of people treated for longer than 6 months (1423 people), and one ongoing study of 217 people which was analysed separately due to methodological concerns. Although the treatment regimens in the included studies varied, most participants received standard first-line antituberculous drugs, and were followed up for more than a year after the end of treatment. The studies included adults and children with TBM, but few participants were HIV-positive.
Relapse was an uncommon event across both groups of studies, with only one death attributed to relapse in each group. Most deaths occurred during the first six months of treatment in both groups of studies, which showed that treatment duration did not have a direct impact on the risk of death in these studies. There was a higher death rate in participants treated for longer than six months, and this probably reflects the differences between the participants in the two groups of studies. Few participants defaulted from treatment, and adherence was not clearly documented.
They found no evidence of high relapse rates in people treated for six months, and relapse was uncommon in all patients irrespective of regimen. There may be differences between the participants treated for six months and longer than six months that could have led to bias (confounding factors), so further research would help determine if shorter regimens are safe. Most of the data were in patients without HIV, and so these inferences do not apply to patients who are HIV-positive.
Although this drug has been available for many years, few systematic reviews of its effectiveness are available and the effects of this drug in helping people cope with the symptoms of schizophrenia are not currently well measured, quantified and known. This systematic review could include only one small study which was small and 30 years old. Flupenthixol was compared with a placebo (dummy drug). Fewer people taking flupenthixol required additional antipsychotic medication but there was no clear difference in people’s ability to cope and function socially. There was no clear information on: improving people’s mental state; helping their behaviour; increasing their use of services; people’s satisfaction with treatment; or costs and cost effectiveness. Flupenthixol is widely available and inexpensive so it is perhaps understandable that it remains a popular drug used for treating people with serious mental illnesses. However, the use of flupenthixol is based more on clinical experience and the decisions of psychiatrists rather than results from large-scale research studies and evidence-based information. The effectiveness and benefits of flupenthixol remain largely unknown and incomplete. Large randomised and placebo-controlled trials could be helpful in increasing knowledge about this drug.
This summary has been written by Ben Gray from RETHINK.
Only three randomised controlled trials, with a total of 130 participants met the review requirements and provided useable data. The quality of evidence available was low, no real difference was noted between chlorpromazine and penfluridol for hospital admissions, incidence of akathisia or numbers of participants leaving the study early. There were no deaths during the trials. We were unable to use the available data for global and mental state due to poor reporting, and no studies reported relapse data. We can not make firm conclusions regarding the comparable effectiveness between chlorpromazine and penfluridol with such poor quality data - but penfluridol only needs to be given once per week - which could help the poor adherence to medication common with schizophrenia. Remarkably, for such old drugs, more trials that report high-quality data are needed.
This review aimed to include randomised or quasi-randomised trials of dengzhanhua preparations in the treatment of patients with recent cerebral infarction. Nine studies involving 723 participants were included. The studies were of poor quality. Although treatment with dengzhanhua injections appeared to improve neurological function, there was no evidence that treatment improved the chance of being alive and free of disability. This review therefore did not find evidence to support the routine use of dengzhanhua for patients with recent stroke. Further well-designed trials are needed.
We included 39 studies that involved a total of 2492 adults. The average ages of the participants in the studies ranged from 34 years to 59 years. When reported, most participants had heel pain for several months. Studies were usually conducted in outpatient specialty clinics of hospitals in 17 countries. Steroid injections were usually given with a local anaesthetic agent. Study follow-up was from one month to over two years.
The studies compared steroid injection with placebo or no treatment (8 studies); tibial nerve block with anaesthetic (2 studies); heel pads (4 studies); oral anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (2 studies); an intensive exercise programme (1 study); shock wave therapy (5 studies); laser (2 studies); radiation therapy (1 study); local NSAID injection (1 study); platelet-rich plasma injections (5 studies); injection of the person's own (autologous) blood (2 studies); botulinum toxin (Botox) injections (2 studies); frozen (cryopreserved) human amniotic membrane injection (1 study); localised peppering involving multiple pricking of the tissues using an inserted needle (1 study); dry needling (1 study); and mini scalpel-needle release (1 study). We also compared different techniques of local steroid injection (5 studies). The eight studies comparing steroid injection with placebo or no steroid injection control provided evidence on heel pain, function, serious adverse events and treatment failure. No studies reported on time to return to work or other activities or short-term adverse events, such as injection-site pain. Steroid injection may slightly reduce heel pain for up to one month after treatment, but not in the longer term including up to six months. We are very unsure whether steroid injection affects longer-term function or reduces treatment failure. There were no serious adverse events, such as infection, reported by these studies. However, these are known to be rare events and we looked at the evidence from all of the studies in the review. Of the 21 studies that reported on adverse events, two studies reported three infections and two ruptures of heel tissues in relation to steroid injection.
The evidence for all reported outcomes, including heel pain, for the other comparisons was always very low quality. This means we are very unsure of the results of these trials. There is low quality evidence that local steroid injections may slightly reduce heel pain up to one month but not subsequently. Although serious complications relating to steroid injection were rare, these were under-reported in the included studies and more cannot be ruled out.
This review looked at all high quality trials comparing the use of calcium channel blockers with a control, in head-injured patients of any age. The authors also looked at trials involving patients suffering from subarachnoid haemorrhage (that is, bleeding into the space between the brain and the skull) caused by an injury, as a subgroup.
The authors found six eligible trials involving 1862 patients. The results indicate that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium channel blockers. The authors conclude that there is some evidence that a calcium channel blocker called nimodipine may be beneficial for some patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. However, there is also an indication of certain adverse reactions amongst patients treated with nimodipine which may mean that the drug is harmful for some individuals.
The authors recommend that the promising results in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage are replicated in a larger well designed trial, before any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the drug can be drawn. In future trials, data on outcomes other than death and severe disability, such as quality of life of the survivors and the economic utility of the drug, should be measured; such outcomes have not been considered in existing research.
We identified 12 relevant studies, which included a total of 2230 participants. The participant populations varied widely across studies regarding age, disease duration, and existing diabetes complications. The mean follow-up duration across studies varied between one and 6.5 years. The majority of the studies were carried out in the 1980s and all studies took place in Europe or North America. We found that intensive glucose control was highly effective in reducing the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications, such as retinopathy (eye disease), nephropathy kidney disease), and neuropathy (nerve disease). For developing retinopathy, 63 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 232 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication. For developing nephropathy, 159 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 284 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication. For developing neuropathy, 49 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 139 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication.
A weaker effect was found on the progression of retinopathy, while we could not find clear evidence of benefit of tight blood sugar control on the progression of nephropathy once participants had developed microalbuminuria (the kidney leaking small amounts of the protein albumin into the urine); no adequate data were available regarding the progression of neuropathy.
Major macrovascular outcomes (such as stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely; therefore we could not draw firm conclusions from the studies included in this review.
We found that intensive glucose control can increase the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, however the results varied across studies and only one big study showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment. An analysis according to haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (a long-term measure of glucose control) at the start of the study suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia with intensive glucose control is possibly only increased for people who started the study with relatively low HbA1c values (less than 9.0%).
There were very few data on health-related quality of life, death from any cause, and costs. Overall, mortality was very low in almost all studies. The effects of intensive glucose control on health-related quality of life were unclear and were consistent with benefit or harm. One study reported that intensive glucose control could be highly cost-effective when considering the potential reduction of diabetes complications in the future.
Tight blood sugar control reduced the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications. The main benefits identified in this review came from studies in younger individuals who were at early stages of the disease. Appropriate patient training is important with these interventions in order to avoid the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. The effects of tight blood sugar control seem to become weaker once complications occur. However, further research is needed on this issue. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effects of tight blood sugar control on older patient populations or individuals with macrovascular disease. There is currently no firm evidence for specific blood glucose targets, therefore treatment goals need to be individualised, taking into account age, disease progression, macrovascular risk, as well as people's lifestyle and disease management capabilities. For the majority of outcomes we evaluated the overall quality of evidence as moderate or low (analysed by the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation' (GRADE) system). This evidence is up to date as of December 2012.
This review finds that giving antibiotics is not supported by conclusive evidence. The review identified four trials involving 852 GBS positive women. Three trials, which were more than 20 years old, compared ampicillin or penicillin to no treatment and found no clear differences in newborn deaths although the occurrence of early GBS infection in the newborn was reduced with antibiotics. The antibiotics ampicillin and penicillin were no different from each other in one trial with 352 GBS positive women. All cases of perinatal GBS infections are unlikely to be prevented even if an effective vaccine is developed.
Anticoagulants are more effective than antiplatelet drugs to prevent a second stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. Nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF) is a heart rhythm disorder commonly found in patients who have had a stroke. Patients with NRAF have an irregular heart beat. This can cause the formation of a blood clot in the left atrium of the heart. This clot may break away and block a cerebral artery, thus causing a stroke. Patients who have had a stroke in the presence of NRAF have a high risk of another stroke. Anticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin, make the blood 'thinner' and prevent the formation of blood clots and hence could prevent stroke. However, anticoagulant drugs may also cause bleeding in the brain and this complication could offset any benefits. Aspirin may be a safer alternative. This review identified two trials in which patients with NRAF who had a stroke were treated with anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy. These studies show that anticoagulants are superior to antiplatelet agents to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.
We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA-125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu-like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA-125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA-125-directed antibody over those given placebo.
For strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. Because no high-certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA-125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form.
Based on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted.
This review assessed the efficacy of marijuana, or cannabinoids, as a treatment for epilepsy. No reliable conclusions can be drawn at present regarding the efficacy of cannabinoids as a treatment for epilepsy. Further trials are needed.
We performed a review of the literature (current up to 20 August 2018) to determine whether use of TEVAR is associated with reduced death and illness when compared to open repair. We identified no randomised controlled trials on this topic. We found no studies undertaken to address our objectives; therefore we were not able to assess the quality of the evidence. We identified no randomised controlled trials on this topic. To perform a randomised controlled trial to clarify optimal management of BTAI would be very challenging to complete, mainly because of the natural history of the condition, usually seen in combination with other life-threatening injuries, the requirement for urgent intervention and the potential difficulties surrounding consent. Despite lack of RCT evidence, clinicians are moving forward with endovascular treatment of BTAI on the basis of meta-analyses of cohort studies and large clinical series.
Only one RCT study, consisting of 70 participants, was found. The study was conducted in teaching hospitals in Iran and Germany. It did not report on changes in fibroid-related symptoms or on the source of study funding.
Key results
The review authors concluded that, to date, evidence is insufficient to allow any conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness and safety of AI drugs in treating women with uterine fibroids.
We found two eligible studies reporting on 18 methodological filters, including six MEDLINE, six Embase and six combined MEDLINE/Embase filters. The firsts study focused on filters on observational studies of surgical interventions. The second study focused on filters for a specific subtype of observational studies: comparative non-randomised studies. Six filters from the first study showed sensitivity of 99.5% to 100% and precision of 16.7% to 21.1%. One type of filter was evaluated by two additional systematic reviews (i.e. externally validated) and found that this retrieved 85.2% to 100% of the articles in the reference standard. Twelve filters from the second study had lower sensitivity (48% to 100%) and much lower precision (0.09% to 4.47%). The included studies had several limitations. The first study used only one systematic review for search strategy development and focused on observational studies of surgical interventions, which might limit the generalizability of the findings to other literature searches. The reference standard in the second study, although encompassing four different systematic reviews, included a limited number of studies, which might affect the accuracy of the performance assessment. Both studies were published 10 years ago and labelling and indexing of observational studies has changed since then.
We wanted to know if PPE reduces worker exposure to asbestos to below the current and proposed OEL, and whether PPE has any unwanted effects. As well as the PPE itself, we were interested in the effects of training or education on putting on (donning) and taking off (doffing) PPE. We looked for studies that evaluated the effect of PPE on exposure to asbestos inside PPE and after doffing PPE. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included six studies that compared inside RPE asbestos concentrations with the matching outside concentrations. These studies recruited between three and 25 workers. Two of these studies evaluated full-face masks with a filter, three evaluated respirators with a motor unit for filtering the air (PAPRs), and two evaluated respirators with a supply of clean breathing air (SARs). We also included one study that compared the effect of different protective coveralls on body temperature in 11 workers. We found no studies that evaluated workers' exposure to asbestos after doffing PPE, and no studies that evaluated interventions for improving compliance with donning and doffing procedures and other regulations. If the asbestos concentration in the environment is below 10 f/cm3, full-face masks may reduce workers' exposure to asbestos to below the current EU OEL of 0.1 f/cm3. Where the outside asbestos concentration is 10 f/cm3 or greater, full-face masks may provide insufficient protection. We were unable to assess whether full-face masks can lower asbestos exposure to below the proposed OEL of 0.01 f/cm3.
SARs probably reduce workers' exposure to asbestos to below the current and proposed EU OELs where the outside asbestos concentration is below 100 f/cm3. There was not enough information for us to assess the effectiveness of SARs at higher outside concentrations.
PAPRs may reduce workers' exposure to asbestos to below the current EU OEL where the outside concentration is below 10 f/cm3, but not at higher concentrations. PAPRs may reduce asbestos concentrations below the proposed EU OEL of 0.01 f/cm3 when the outside concentration is below 0.1 f/cm3.
Polyethylene (Tyvek) suits may increase body temperature more than ventilated polyvinyl (Mururoa) suits, but the temperature increase should have no health consequences. The main limitation of the evidence is that the studies did not directly compare different types of protective equipment worn by the same workers in the same environment. Also, the results were imprecise because the studies included few participants.
There is limited information in the studies about workers' individual characteristics and behaviour, and about donning and doffing procedures. More research is needed to assess the effects of these factors. The evidence is current to 15 September 2022.
We found only one small randomised controlled trial (including 210 very low birth weight newborn infants) that addressed this question. This trial did not show that early planned removal of UVCs from infants could reduce their chance of developing a bloodstream infection. However, because the trial was small, this finding is not certain. The trial did not provide sufficient evidence to inform policy or practice; larger trials are needed to resolve this question fully.
No study matched our inclusion criteria. There is currently no evidence to support the efficacy or safety of the use of oral H1 antihistamines alone in the treatment of eczema. This does not mean that such antihistamines could not be useful as an add-on therapy to the main treatments including topical steroids, which will be the topic of a further review.
We included nine randomised controlled trials which compared the efficacy and safety of 8 to 24 weeks of chromium supplementation and placebo in overweight or obese adults (i.e. with a body mass index between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2 defining being overweight and a body mass index of 30kg/m2 or more defining obesity). A total of 622 participants took part in the studies, 346 participants received chromium picolinate and 276 received placebo. The evidence is current to December 2012. When the results obtained from the doses of chromium picolinate investigated (200 µg, 400 µg, 500 µg, 1000 µg) were pooled, study participants lost around 1 kg of body weight more than participants receiving placebo. We were unable to find good evidence that this potential weight loss effect increased with increasing dose of chromium picolinate. Only three of nine studies provided information on adverse events, so we were unable to determine whether chromium picolinate supplements are safe and whether any potential harms may increase with dose. In addition, the length of studies included was rather short (maximum of 24 weeks), so we were unable to determine any long-term effects of supplementation. No study reported whether supplementation was associated with increases in deaths from any cause or illnesses (such as myocardial infarction or stroke), or the health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects of supplementation. The overall quality of evidence was considered low and we have inadequate information from which to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of chromium picolinate supplementation in overweight or obese adults.
We searched the literature for both randomized and non-randomized studies, and found none which were eligible for inclusion. We found no eligible studies of computer and mobile technology intervention strategies for individuals with thalassemia. We did not identify any evidence for inclusion in the review.
This review included nine randomised controlled trials involving 1118 women and assessed six of these studies (involving 394 women) comparing umbilical vein injection of normal saline with or without oxytocin. Other comparisons did not provide the required information. With umbilical vein injection of saline solution plus oxytocin versus umbilical vein injection of saline solution there was no evidence of a difference in the amount of blood lost, duration of the third stage of labour or need for manual removal of a retained placenta. routine use of umbilical injection after childbirth to deliver any infusion, though the combined results of the small number of relevant studies showed no evidence of effect and further research is needed to make a conclusion. There is a need for training in the technique and a possible higher cost of materials.
We found nine randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) that allocated people with diabetes to either a group that received a non-nutritive sweetener or a comparator group. The comparator was usual diet with additional sugar in three studies; placebo (a dummy pill) in five studies; and tagatose (a nutritive low-calorie sweetener) in one study. The studies included a total of 979 participants; most of the studies were small, with fewer than 100 participants. The length of the studies varied from 4 to 10 months.
This evidence is up-to-date as of May 2019. Data on health-related quality of life, diabetes complications, death from any cause, and socioeconomic effects (such as absence from work, visits to general practitioner, medication consumption) were lacking, and data were generally sparse for all comparisons. The available data did not show a clear difference between non-nutritive sweeteners and sugar, placebo, or the nutritive low-calorie sweetener tagatose for HbA1c, body weight, and side effects. We rated the overall certainty of the evidence as very low, mainly due to the small numbers of included studies and participants and methodological limitations of the included studies.
We reviewed studies of psychotherapies, including a specific form of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-BN). We compared psychotherapy to control groups who got no treatment (e.g. people on waiting lists) and the specific CBT-BN with other types of psychotherapy. We found that CBT was better than other therapies, and better than no treatment, at reducing binge eating. Other psychotherapies were also better than no treatment in reducing binge eating. Some studies found that self-help using the CBT manual can be helpful, but more research and larger trials are needed.
We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatments) looking at the effects of tai chi on adults at high risk of developing CVD. We did not included people who had already had CVD (e.g. heart attacks and strokes). The evidence is current to December 2013. We found 13 trials, none of them were large enough or of long enough duration to examine the effects of tai chi on reducing cardiovascular deaths or non-fatal endpoints. There were variations in the duration and style of tai chi and the follow-up of the interventions ranged from three to 12 months. Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies. None of the included studies reported on adverse events. Longer-term, high-quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of tai chi for CVD prevention. The results of this review should be treated with caution as the studies were small, of short duration and there was some risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).
We identified 11 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1387 participants. Their average age was 69 years and all trials included men and women. The participants were randomised to have either balloon angioplasty alone or balloon angioplasty with stent placement. At two years, blood flowing through the narrowing in the arteries was no greater in participants with a stent inserted than in those without. There was a small improvement in the distance that the participants with a stent could walk up to one year later. However, when asked about their quality of life there was no improvement, whether a stent was placed or not, up to one year later. There were differences in the included trials; in some trials people with narrowings in other leg arteries were included. There were also differences between trials in the blood thinning drugs given after stent placement, which may change results, as these agents are important in keeping stents working in other parts of the body. These factors led us to the conclusion that there is a small benefit to adding a stent when performing balloon angioplasty for people in whom balloon angioplasty fails. However, there is insufficient evidence to support this approach as routine practice for everyone and future trials should examine whether subgroups of patients may benefit from stenting.
Due to the low number of studies and low quality of evidence, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of DMT for depression. It was not possible to compare DMT with medication, talking therapies, physical treatments or to compare types of DMT due to lack of available evidence. Key findings were:
Overall, there is no evidence for or against DMT as a treatment for depression. There is some evidence to suggest DMT is more effective than standard care for adults, but this was not clinically significant. DMT is no more effective than standard care for young people.
Evidence from just one study of low methodological quality suggested that drop-out rates from the DMT group were not significant, and there is no reliable effect in either direction for quality of life or self esteem. A large positive effect was observed for social functioning, but since this was from one study of low methodological quality the result is imprecise. Future studies should be of high methodological quality, comparing DMT with other treatments for depression, and include economic analyses.
We performed a search in March 2014 and found three relevant randomised trials. Two comparing endoscopic versus surgical interventions (111 patients with durations of two and three years), while the third compared surgery to conservative treatment (i.e. no intervention) (32 patients with a duration of 16 months). We found that surgery achieved pain relief in a higher proportion of participants than endoscopy. Surgery also had other advantages like improved quality of life for the first two years after intervention, although this difference disappeared with time. Similarly, surgery reduced the risk of developing malabsorption due to failure of the pancreas, but with longer follow-up this advantage became smaller. The studies seemingly showed no difference between endoscopy and surgery in complications after interventions. We also compared surgery with conservative treatment. The results of one trial suggested that surgery early in the condition achieved better pain relief and preservation of pancreatic function. For endoscopy versus surgery, the quality of the evidence for pain relief, quality of life and pancreatic function was moderate (according to GRADE). For both complications and mortality this was low, since the two trials were too small to make reliable conclusions. The quality of evidence regarding surgery versus conservative treatment was low, since the trial was small, which precluded drawing reliable conclusions regarding all outcomes.
The bacterial infection of the urine often persisted, whether antibiotics were given or not. It was uncertain whether antibiotics prevented symptomatic urinary infection or increased the risk of selecting bacteria resistant to antibiotics, because there were too few data and several limitations in the included studies. Also, it was unclear whether the use of antibiotics in case of urinary infection without symptoms reduced the risks of graft rejection, need for hospitalisation due to symptoms of urinary infection, or mortality, or whether antibiotics improved the function of the kidney transplant. One study with 112 participants suggested there were no severe harmful reactions caused by the antibiotic treatment, and non-severe adverse events appeared to be rare. It is uncertain whether antibiotics are beneficial in kidney transplant recipients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. In one study, participants were assigned to antibiotics or no therapy by a method that was not random (i.e. according to patients' transplant code). In both studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. antibiotics or no therapy), which may have influenced the results. Last, we had not enough data to estimate with precision some effects of antibiotics. More research is needed.
We found no studies for this Cochrane review (search date 31 July 2015) and so we do not know if the baby or babies who remain after fetal reduction have better outcomes or if there are any risks in the procedure. Evidence from other types of studies does exist but there are problems with making sense of the data. For the present, we cannot be sure whether pregnancy reduction does lead to better outcomes for the remaining fetuses, and by how much. We cannot be sure which particular outcomes improve, and what risks may arise. In the future, we may get a better picture, with a different type of study which takes into account parental preference, and which tracks the results. In the meantime, parents can come to a decision about whether they want the option of pregnancy reduction after discussion with their midwives and doctors. The discussion will take into account how acceptable the parents find the intervention, and what outcomes they are hoping to achieve.
We searched the literature up to June 2016 and found 19 studies, with a total of 1096 adults randomly assigned to receive buffered or non-buffered fluids. Some included trials involved minor surgery in otherwise fit and healthy patients. Other trials analysed outcomes after major surgery in high-risk patients, and five trials included patients undergoing renal transplant surgery. We reran the search in May 2017 and decided that we will deal with one new study of interest when we update the review. Overall results show that the number of deaths was low and provide no evidence that choice of fluids - buffered or non-buffered - influenced the number of deaths that occurred around the time of surgery in the three trials that looked at this outcome (involving 267 participants). We found no differences between groups in the numbers of participants whose kidney function was adversely affected. Analysis of clinical outcomes suggests that buffered fluids are an equally safe and effective alternative to non-buffered fluids for adult patients undergoing surgery. The pH of the blood after surgery was reduced among patients receiving saline (pH 7.32 vs 7.38), suggesting that buffered fluids are associated with less metabolic acidosis. The saline group had higher serum chloride and sodium levels than the buffered fluid group. This might be expected, as members of the saline group were receiving saline and no other electrolytes. Higher serum chloride is a cause of metabolic acidosis. We assessed the quality of evidence as generally moderate, although quality of evidence showing effects of fluid choice on kidney function was low because of the presence of other factors that could affect kidney function in these participants. Evidence shows wide variation in the types of surgery performed and in drivers for and volumes of fluid administered across trials. Reported outcomes varied a great deal between included trials, and some results were expressed in ways that did not allow their inclusion in our findings.
The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of various treatments for growth failure in childhood Crohn's disease. Three randomized controlled trials were identified. One trial did not show any benefit for linear growth with 6-mercaptopurine treatment compared to placebo among children being treated with steroids. The other two trials looked at nutritional treatment (elemental feedings) versus steroids (prednisolone). Both trials showed a statistically significant benefit for height velocity standard deviation scores with nutritional treatment. However, these results need to be confirmed by large, multi-centre, randomized controlled trials of therapeutic interventions in pre-pubertal children with Crohn's disease. These trials should use growth as an outcome measure. In conclusion, more research is needed to identify effective treatments for growth failure in childhood Crohn's disease.
We found two studies that included children with upper airway infections: one involved 558 children who were recruited from 61 general practices in England and Wales; and another of 269 doctors who provided data on 33,792 patient-doctor consultations in Kentucky, USA. Participants were children accompanied by an adult. One study trained general practitioners (GPs) to discuss written information with parents, and in the other, doctors distributed copies of government-sponsored pamphlets to parents. Both studies were funded by government bodies and one was also funded by Pfizer (a pharmaceutical company). Providing a booklet and explanation by a specially-trained doctor reduced the number of antibiotics children consumed by 20% (from 42% to 22%) without affecting parent satisfaction with consultation or numbers of return visits for the same illness. Compared to the doctor’s usual practice, two studies showed that providing a booklet reduced the proportion of children prescribed an antibiotic by 9% to 21%. When doctors were also given feedback on their antibiotic prescribing along with providing a booklet to parents, the proportion of children prescribed an antibiotic increased by 6% (from 44% to 50%). None of the included studies assessed if people were better informed, how long symptoms lasted, or if people had complications. Evidence quality was moderate to low. Doctors and parents knew when written information had been used. One study had a high risk of bias because study groups were not comparable at baseline, so we can be less confident of its findings.
Studies were set in the UK and USA, so results are not applicable to lower-income countries, nor for different primary healthcare services, including settings where prescriptions are unnecessary to obtain antibiotics.
We judged the certainty of evidence to be moderate to very low for all outcomes. This is because the studies were often small with a low number of events and, in many cases, were not reported in a way that meant we could be sure they had been conducted robustly. The certainty of the evidence means that we cannot make conclusive statements and better quality research is needed to form stronger conclusions.
This plain language summary is up to date as of October 2016.
Through searches of medical databases up to November 2018, review authors found seven studies that assessed the effects of stopping feeds during blood transfusion. Of these seven, one study was a non-randomised observational study, four studies are ongoing, and one study was terminated with no results available. Only one study involving 22 preterm infants was eligible for inclusion in the review. Randomised controlled trials have provided limited evidence on the effects of feeding practices during blood transfusion and the development of NEC. Only one small trial was included in the analysis, and this trial did not report any cases of transfusion-associated NEC in the enteral feeding or non-feeding groups. Data were insufficient to allow any meaningful conclusions based on the very low quality of evidence according to the GRADE rating. Large randomised controlled trials are needed to answer the review question.
This review included nine studies with a total of 1354 participants. One study reported improvement in urinary albumin levels following use of thiamine. None of the other studies reported improvement in kidney function or reduction in urinary albumin excretion after two to 36 months monotherapy with vitamin B therapy. Vitamin B therapy was reported to well-tolerated with mild side effects in studies with treatment duration of more than six months. Studies of less than six months duration did not explicitly report adverse events; they reported that the drugs were well-tolerated without any serious drug related adverse events. All these findings require confirmation in larger studies before they can be accepted as definite.
We searched for any randomised controlled trial comparing either codeine (or medications produced from codeine) versus placebo in the treatment of chronic cough (4 weeks or longer) in children aged 18 years and younger. The search identified 556 records. We reviewed and assessed all of these against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. We found no eligible studies to include in this review. However, our search did find studies that investigated codeine (or medications produced from codeine) in the treatment of acute cough (two weeks or less) in children. Another Cochrane review specifically for children with acute cough evaluated these studies and found no evidence to support or oppose use of codeine (or medications produced from codeine). This overall lack of evidence is consistent with international chronic cough guidelines, which recommend treating the cause of the cough. Due to the known risks associated with use, in particular the increased risks for children, governing bodies in the USA, Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia have stated these medications are now not recommended for children younger than 12 years of age and children between 12 to 18 years with respiratory conditions. Given the lack of supporting trials, the findings from trials of acute cough in children, and the known harmful side effects, we have concluded that codeine-based medications cannot be recommended in children with chronic cough. We found no studies and hence there is no quality of evidence.
Only one randomized controlled trial was identified, involving 48 participants. Considering the small sample size and methodological limitation, no implications on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions post-stroke can be drawn. Several ongoing trials will, in time, contribute to the current body of evidence. However, more research is needed.
This review examined interventions aimed at reducing such anxiety. Anxiety associated with colposcopic examination appears to be reduced by a variety of interventions including playing music during colposcopy, and viewing the procedure on a TV monitor (video colposcopy).
Many of the early trials used unsatisfactory methods, were small, and publication bias cannot be excluded. Overall, evidence that Ginkgo has predictable and clinically significant benefit for people with dementia or cognitive impairment is inconsistent and unreliable. Of the four most recent trials to report results, three found no difference between Ginkgo biloba and placebo, and one reported very large treatment effects in favour of Ginkgo biloba.
This review identified seven trials, with over 10,000 patients, that tested skin antiseptics (chlorhexidine solution) against normal soap or no presurgical washing. The review of these trials did not show clear evidence that the use of chlorhexidine solution before surgery was better than other wash products at preventing surgical site infections from developing after surgery.
We did not find any relevant trials to include in this review. The evidence to support the routine use of vaccines against pneumococcal infection is not strong; however, many countries now recommend that all children receive the vaccine as part of their childhood immunisation programmes.
We included two studies with a total of 40 people (35 from one study and five from a second study). Of these people, 21 participated in exercise training and 19 did not participate in exercise training. All people were men and they were between 55 and 86 years old. Both exercise training programmes included cycling and walking and one programme also included strength training exercises. In both studies, training lasted for eight weeks with people attending two to three sessions per week. Immediately following exercise training, people walked an average of 53.81 metres further in a six-minute walk test than those who did not complete exercise training. Six months following exercise training, people walked 52.68 metres further in a six-minute walk test than those who did not complete exercise training. These improvements in exercise capacity were similar for people with dust-related interstitial lung disease and people with asbestos related pleural disease. Quality of life also improved more in people who exercised compared to those who did not. No one reported experiencing any unwanted effects due to exercise training. The quality of evidence was very low because there were only two studies and 40 people. Therefore, it is likely that these findings will change with more studies in the future. We need bigger studies that can confirm the findings of this Cochrane review.
Four studies including 606 patients were included in this review. Pooled analysis of these trials revealed vedolizumab is significantly more effective than placebo (sham infusion) for inducing clinical remission and response (improvement of symptoms), as well as endoscopic remission (healing of inflamed mucosa in the colon) in patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis. Evidence from one study suggests that vedolizumab is superior to placebo for preventing relapse (recurrence of active disease) in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. Patients receiving vedolizumab were no more likely than placebo patients to experience side effects or serious side effects. Commonly reported side effects included: worsening ulcerative colitis, headache, nasopharyngitis (inflammation of nose and throat), upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, and abdominal pain. Further research is needed in order to define the optimal dose, frequency of drug administration and the long-term effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab used for induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. Vedolizumab should be compared to other currently approved therapies of ulcerative colitis in these studies.
Our systematic review found 17 controlled studies involving 2596 affected children that used these drugs for a short duration and assessed short-term outcomes. When comparing glucocorticoids to placebo, no differences were found for either hospital admissions or length of hospital stay. There was no substantial benefit in other health outcomes. These findings are consistent and likely to be applicable in diverse settings.
Exploratory results from one large high-quality trial suggest that combined treatment of systemic glucocorticoids (dexamethasone) and bronchodilators (epinephrine) may significantly reduce hospital admissions. There were no relevant short-term adverse effects that were any different from those seen with an inactive placebo, while long-term safety was not assessed. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy, safety and applicability of this promising approach.
We updated this review of inhaled corticosteroids to help resolve ongoing uncertainties about their role in people with COPD. We analysed their effects on frequency of flare-ups ('exacerbations'), quality of life, breathing capacity, death rates and side effects such as pneumonia. We searched medical databases for studies comparing inhaled corticosteroids versus inhaled placebo (pretend treatment) in people with stable COPD. We included 36 studies, involving 23,139 participants. Pooling the data from the trials showed that inhaled corticosteroids were beneficial in reducing the frequency of exacerbations and slowing down the rate of decline in quality of life. There was a long-term benefit (after six months of treatment) in slowing the rate of decline in breathing capacity. Death rates from any cause were unchanged. Inhaled corticosteroids increased the risk of side effects including thrush (Candida) infection in the mouth, voice hoarseness and pneumonia.
In deciding whether to use this treatment, consumers and health professionals should weigh up the benefits against the side effects. Overall, we have low to moderate confidence in the evidence underlying these findings. We have moderate confidence in the evidence for the findings related to COPD exacerbations, quality of life, breathing capacity, death rates and side effects. This was due to some variation in the data across these studies. We have low confidence in the evidence for pneumonia risk due to variable results across a number of studies. We searched for studies up to October 2022.
We included 12 trials that involved 3617 women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes. Women were randomly selected to either early birth or expectant management (wait for birth).The women were between 25 to 37 weeks of pregnancy. The studies happened in 16 countries between 1977 and 2013. Overall, the 12 studies were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias and the evidence was of moderate to high quality.
We found no difference in the rate of infant infection or infant death before birth between the two groups. However, early birth increased the risk of infant death after birth, as well as breathing problems, with the newborn needing extra help to breathe. The babies of women who had a planned early birth were more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care, and were born earlier than babies of women who waited to give birth. Early birth also increased the rate of caesarean section, induction of labour and the risk of infection of the lining of the womb but decreased the risk of infection in the membranes. Women had a longer hospital stay if they were randomised to waiting. In women whose waters break before 37 weeks of pregnancy, waiting for labour to begin naturally is the best option for healthier outcomes, as long as there are no other reasons why the baby should be born immediately.
Routine outcome monitoring of CMHDs using PROMs was not shown conclusively to be helpful in analyses combining study results, either in terms of improving patient symptom outcomes (across 12 studies), or in changing the duration of treatment for their conditions (across seven studies). It was not possible to analyse changes in drug treatment or referrals for further treatment as only two studies reported these. Similarly, health-related quality of life, social functioning, adverse events, and costs were reported in very few studies. More research of better quality is required, especially in primary care where most CMHDs are treated. Studies should include people treated with drugs as well as psychological therapies, and should follow them for longer than six months. As well as symptoms and length of treatment, studies should measure possible harms, quality of life, social functioning, and the costs of monitoring.
We wanted to find out whether physical measures stop or slow the spread of respiratory viruses from well-controlled studies in which one intervention is compared to another, known as randomised controlled trials. We searched for randomised controlled studies that looked at physical measures to stop people acquiring a respiratory virus infection.
We were interested in how many people in the studies caught a respiratory virus infection, and whether the physical measures had any unwanted effects. We identified 78 relevant studies. They took place in low-, middle-, and high-income countries worldwide: in hospitals, schools, homes, offices, childcare centres, and communities during non-epidemic influenza periods, the global H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, epidemic influenza seasons up to 2016, and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified five ongoing, unpublished studies; two of them evaluate masks in COVID-19. Five trials were funded by government and pharmaceutical companies, and nine trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies.
No studies looked at face shields, gowns and gloves, or screening people when they entered a country.
We assessed the effects of:
· medical or surgical masks;
· N95/P2 respirators (close-fitting masks that filter the air breathed in, more commonly used by healthcare workers than the general public); and
· hand hygiene (hand-washing and using hand sanitiser).
We obtained the following results:
Medical or surgical masks
Ten studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask in the community studies only, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness/COVID-like illness (9 studies; 276,917 people); and probably makes little or no difference in how many people have flu/COVID confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 13,919 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported; discomfort was mentioned.
N95/P2 respirators
Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes little to no difference in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make little to no difference in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people), or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well-reported; discomfort was mentioned.
Hand hygiene
Following a hand hygiene programme may reduce the number of people who catch a respiratory or flu-like illness, or have confirmed flu, compared with people not following such a programme (19 studies; 71,210 people), although this effect was not confirmed as statistically significant reduction when ILI and laboratory-confirmed ILI were analysed separately. Few studies measured unwanted effects; skin irritation in people using hand sanitiser was mentioned. Our confidence in these results is generally low to moderate for the subjective outcomes related to respiratory illness, but moderate for the more precisely defined laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection, related to masks and N95/P2 respirators. The results might change when further evidence becomes available. Relatively low numbers of people followed the guidance about wearing masks or about hand hygiene, which may have affected the results of the studies. We included evidence published up to October 2022.
We wanted to find out which type of laryngoscope works best for intubation for medical staff and patients. Which type of laryngoscope works best for certain groups of patients: for example, those with neck restrictions or obesity, different medical staff (experienced or less experienced) and in different settings (in or out of hospital). We also wanted to find out if any of the laryngoscopes cause unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared Macintosh laryngoscopes against each of the three different types of videolaryngoscopes.  We compared and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study design, methods and numbers of participants. We found 222 studies with 26,149 adults who were intubated using a laryngoscope. Most people were undergoing surgery and the intubation was planned or expected, but some intubations happened in emergency situations. Most studies included a mix of people. Some studies were in selected groups, such as people who were obese or when medical staff expected that intubation may be difficult. The studies were conducted in countries from around the world. Manufacturers of laryngoscopes were involved in 14 of the studies. Compared to the traditional Macintosh laryngoscope, all three types of videolaryngoscope probably reduce the number of failed intubations. Hyperangulated videolaryngoscopes may lead to fewer failed intubations particularly in people with an airway that is difficult to intubate (or an expected difficult airway). All videolaryngoscopes may also increase the chances of being successfully intubated on the first attempt and improve the view of the vocal cords.
Macintosh-style and channelled videolaryngoscopes probably reduce the risk of the person experiencing a low oxygen level, but there may be little or no difference when a hyperangulated videolaryngoscope is used. Using a hyperangulated videolaryngoscope may reduce the risk of the breathing tube being accidentally inserted into the food pipe instead of the windpipe. The other videolaryngoscopes may or may not reduce this risk.
No type of laryngoscope increased or reduced accidental damage to the teeth, but we are very uncertain about this finding. We were unable to tell if any of the laryngoscopes reduced the time taken for intubation. We were moderately confident that videolaryngoscopes reduce failed intubations. We had moderate to very low confidence in our other findings. It was not possible for researchers to conceal what type of laryngoscope the medical staff used and this might have affected how they carried out intubations. The studies included different types of people, and some findings included the possibility of benefits or harms for both types of laryngoscope. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up-to-date to March 2021.
This review found six trials that included 1078 women. Using information from the trials, we found that giving chemotherapy before surgery helped women to live longer and also to live longer without cancer. It was not clear whether chemotherapy made radical surgery easier or helped to stop the cancer from coming back. The type of drugs used, and how they were given, did not affect the results. Also, results were similar in women with both early stage and more advanced stages of disease.
In one trial, all of the women also had radiotherapy after surgery (post-operative radiotherapy). In the other trials, up to two thirds of women got this post-operative radiotherapy. We are not sure how this extra treatment affects the results. It may also give women more side-effects.
Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy seems to help women with cervical cancer live for longer and also to live for longer without disease, the results are based on only a small number of trials. If new drugs or new combinations of drugs show promising results, it may be worth doing more trials with these new treatments of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery.
We found 43 studies including more than 30,000 people with COPD. More studies used fluticasone (26 studies; 21,247 people) than budesonide (17 studies; 10,150 people). A higher proportion of people in the studies were male (around 70%), and their COPD was generally classed as severe. The last search for studies to include in the review was done in September 2013.
We compared each drug against controls and assessed separately the results of studies that compared ICS versus placebo, and an ICS/LABA combination versus LABA alone. We also conducted an indirect comparison of budesonide and fluticasone based on their effects against placebo, to explore whether one drug was safer than the other.
Fluticasone increased 'serious' pneumonias (requiring hospital admission). Over 18 months, 18 more people of every 1000 treated with fluticasone were admitted to hospital for pneumonia.
Budesonide also increased pneumonias that were classed as 'serious'. Over nine months, six more hospital admissions were reported for every 1000 individuals treated with budesonide. A lower dose of budesonide (320 mcg) was associated with fewer serious pneumonias than a higher dose (640 mcg).
No more deaths overall were reported in the ICS groups compared with controls, and deaths related to pneumonia were too rare to tell either way.
When we compared fluticasone and budesonide versus each other, the difference between them was not clear enough to tell whether one was safer (for pneumonia, requiring a hospital stay, general adverse events and death). The risk of any pneumonia event (i.e. less serious cases that could be treated without going to hospital) was higher with fluticasone than with budesonide.
Evidence was rated to be of high or moderate quality for most outcomes. When an outcome is rated of high quality, further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect, but moderate ratings reflect some uncertainty in the findings. Results from the budesonide studies were generally less clear because they were based on fewer people, and the studies were shorter. Budesonide and fluticasone, delivered alone or in combination with LABA, can increase serious pneumonias that result in hospitalisation of people. Neither has been shown to affect the chance of dying compared with not taking ICS. Comparison of the two drugs revealed no difference in serious pneumonias or risk of death. Fluticasone was associated with a higher risk of any pneumonia (i.e. cases that could be treated in the community) than budesonide, but potential differences in the definition used by the respective drug manufacturers reduced our confidence in this finding. These concerns need to be balanced with the known benefits of ICS (e.g. fewer exacerbations, improved lung function and quality of life).
Researchers should remain aware of the risks associated with ICS and should make sure that pneumonia is properly diagnosed in studies.
Compared to standard, early KRT initiation may have no benefits on death; however, may increase recovery of kidney function and probably reduces the number of days in ICU and hospital stay, but increases the risk of adverse events in patients with AKI in intensive care units. Nevertheless, regarding death and recovery of kidney function, early KRT initiation showed a range of values that included benefits as well as harms.
In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation-liaison) for depression and anxiety. There were problems with the methods in some of the studies. For example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow-up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years. A smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life. Patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.
We wanted to find out whether and, if so, how effective antibiotics are at reducing the chances of getting rheumatic fever again, and this leading to rheumatic heart disease. We included studies that randomly gave people with past rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease antibiotics or not (e.g. based on flipping a coin). We were interested in comparing, firstly, long-term antibiotics with no antibiotics and, secondly, long-term intramuscular penicillin with long-term oral antibiotics. Participants in the studies we included had previous rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease, but could be any age. We looked for lots of different events that could have happened, including the rheumatic fever coming back (rheumatic fever recurrence), rheumatic heart disease getting worse (progression of rheumatic heart disease), problems with the heart (carditis), problems around pregnancy and birth (obstetric complications and foetal/neonatal events), death (mortality), whether people stuck to their treatment (treatment adherence), other problems such as dangerous breathing problems (anaphylaxis), complications such as nerve injury and whether the people included were happy with having antibiotics. We found 11 studies (3951 participants) to help us answer our questions. People in these studies were an average of 12.3 years of age and were 50.6% male. Most had had previous episodes of rheumatic fever.
We found that using long-term antibiotics (either injected into the muscle every month or taken as a tablet every day) compared with no antibiotic probably reduces the risk of getting more episodes of rheumatic fever. The injection into a muscle route probably works better than the tablets. If you have the early stages of rheumatic heart disease picked up on an echocardiogram of the heart (a scan that uses sound waves to see the internal structure of the heart), then penicillin antibiotics injected into the muscle every month compared with no antibiotic likely reduces the risk of these heart problems getting worse. We found some evidence that antibiotics injected into the muscle compared with no antibiotics may not cause a very high risk of allergic reaction that affects breathing (anaphylaxis), but probably comes with a higher chance of redness at the injection side and allergic reactions to antibiotics. There was not much information on death rates or nerve injury, and no evidence on whether an antibiotic injection is better than tablets for preventing latent (early) rheumatic heart disease getting worse. The majority of the included studies (nine) were not carried out in low-income countries, which currently have the most cases of rheumatic heart disease. This makes these results potentially less relevant to people in these countries. There is also little information on important questions other than recurrence of rheumatic fever or progression of rheumatic heart disease. There were some other potential limitations in the evidence: we flagged six studies as having issues with blinding (study participants or staff knowing whether they received antibiotics and so potentially answering based on this information). It is possible that people in many of the included studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Four studies may have had a problem with the process for placing people randomly into groups. For some of the results in the review, we only had one study.
More high-quality work is needed that is relevant to the parts of the world where rheumatic fever is currently most common. More research looking at early (latent) rheumatic heart disease, where the biggest differences may be made, is also needed. The evidence is current to 10 March 2024. Whilst this is the most up-to-date review available currently, most of the evidence in this review is from the 1950s to 1960s, so some of the treatments may be outdated.
We found 11 trials involving 1836 caregiver participants in total. The trials commonly evaluated an intervention that provided emotional support and advice on coping. Two studies aimed to help support the family and friends indirectly by addressing the needs of the patient. Apart from one trial providing patient care, none provided practical support. Trials compared those who received the intervention with those who did not, to see if the intervention helped the family, family member or friend cope with their caring role. Trials commonly evaluated the intervention by measuring whether it improved the caregiver's general wellbeing.
The review found that interventions that directly support the family and/or friends help them to cope emotionally, and may help them to cope with their role in caring and improve their quality of life. There were few assessments of the impact of the interventions on physical health; one study found overall no difference in sleep improvement. No study looked at whether the interventions increased or decreased the carers' health service use or looked for potential harms, although higher levels of family conflict was identified in some participants in one trial. Interventions that aimed to help support the family and/or friends indirectly via patient care, may also help them cope emotionally. There were no assessments on whether the indirect interventions helped them cope with their role in caring, improved quality of life, increased or decreased their health service use, or had potential harms. In one of these trials there was no difference in caregiver physical health between those whose friend or relative had received the additional patient care, and those who had not. The findings of some studies included in this review may be at risk of bias, because they under-report key design features and may have been conducted poorly.
In this systematic review, the efficacy of LED phototherapy was compared with conventional (non-LED) phototherapy. LED phototherapy was observed to be efficacious in bringing down the levels of serum total bilirubin, at rates similar to phototherapy with conventional light sources.
The evidence is current to 12 August 2016. This updated review includes 16 randomised controlled studies (1807 participants) containing 20 comparisons of deferasirox versus another treatment.
In people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia, two studies compared deferasirox with placebo and nine studies (1251 participants) compared deferasirox with standard treatment of deferoxamine. Four studies (205 participants) compared deferasirox to deferiprone. One study each compared deferasirox and deferiprone respectively to deferasirox and deferiprone combination therapy (40 participants), deferasirox and deferoxamine combination therapy to deferoxamine alone (94 participants) and deferasirox and deferiprone combination therapy to deferiprone and deferoxamine combination therapy (96 participants).
In people with non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (individuals not requiring regular blood transfusions), one study (166 participants) compared deferasirox to placebo. The duration of the included studies ranged from 12 days to two years. Two studies comparing deferasirox with placebo in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia showed that deferasirox was effective at removing iron. Nine other studies compared deferasirox with standard treatment of deferoxamine. Similar effectiveness seems possible, depending of the doses of the two drugs compared. It needs to be confirmed whether this leads to similar improvements in patient-important outcomes in the long run. The safety of deferasirox was acceptable; however, rarer adverse events or long-term side effects could not be adequately investigated due to the limited number of participants and the relatively short duration of the studies. Patient satisfaction was significantly better with deferasirox among those who had previously been treated with deferoxamine. The rate of discontinuations was similar for both drugs. Deferasirox may be an alternative for those individuals who do not tolerate, or have poor adherence with, deferoxamine. In people with a strong preference to deferasirox, potential benefits and risks should be discussed.
One study (41 participants) reported that more individuals with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia experienced joint pain when treated with deferiprone than with deferasirox, but due to the large number of different types of adverse events reported and compared, this result may be due to chance. One study revealed that adherence to treatment was higher when both oral iron chelators, deferasirox and deferiprone are used than the combination of deferiprone and deferoxamine, but no participant discontinued the study. We found no evidence for any differences comparing deferasirox or deferiprone alone to combined deferasirox and deferiprone treatment or deferasirox and deferoxamine combination to deferoxamine alone, but the numbers of people in the studies were small and available data were very limited.
One study in people with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia found deferasirox was better at reducing serum ferritin and liver iron concentration compared to placebo. However, there is no evidence on the impact on patient-important outcomes or long-term safety data in this population. The quality of included studies comparing deferasirox to deferoxamine in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia was moderate to low, mainly due fact that the investigators and participants knew which interventions had been assigned to which participants, the small number of participants included in the studies and the use of a surrogate markers (measures used in place of a hard clinical end point) instead of patient-important outcomes. For the comparison of deferasirox to placebo in people with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia, the quality of the evidence was moderate to very low based on only one small study. For the other comparisons, the quality of the evidence was low to very low, mainly due to the inclusion of even fewer participants. Ideally, further randomised studies looking at patient-important, long-term outcomes and rarer adverse events, should be conducted.
The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included 141 studies involving 15,141 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive-aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery because they were suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). Cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) was the most common blood biomarker studied. Seventy studies evaluated 47 blood biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis, and 82 studies identified 97 biomarkers that did not distinguish between the two groups. Twenty-two biomarkers were in both categories. Only four of the assessed biomarkers (anti-endometrial Abs (anti-endometrial autoantibodies), interleukin-6 (IL-6), CA-19.9 and CA-125) were evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of these tests was accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. Overall, there is not enough evidence to recommend testing for any blood biomarker in clinical practice to diagnose endometriosis. Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality, and most blood tests were only assessed by a single or a small number of studies. When the same biomarker was studied, there were significant differences in how studies were conducted, the group of women studied and the cut-offs used to determine a positive result. More high quality research trials are necessary to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of certain blood biomarkers, whose diagnostic value for endometriosis was suggested by a limited number of studies.
We updated our search for evidence from randomised controlled studies in July 2019. We included two studies, published in 1989 and 2019. The older study was conducted in the USA and the more recent study was from a number of hospital obstetric units in the UK. A total of 3813 women undergoing operative vaginal delivery were included. The USA study involved 393 women and compared 2 g of intravenous cefotetan after cord clamping with no treatment. The other study involved 3420 women. This study compared intravenous amoxicillin and clavulanic acid with placebo. The certainty of the evidence varied from high certainty to low, with low certainty being downgraded because of concerns relating to imprecise results, with few events and only a single study reporting on a number of the findings.

Prophylactic antibiotics given to reduce or prevent infection halved the number of women with infected episiotomies or lacerations. These findings included superficial and deep perineal wound infections (one study, 3420 women; high-certainty evidence) or wound breakdown (one study, 2593 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Serious infectious complications were also reduced (one study, 3420 women; high-certainty evidence). Due to low-certainty evidence, prophylactic antibiotics had uncertain effects on endometritis, experienced as fever and uterine tenderness or heavy bleeding (two studies, 3813 women; low-certainty evidence) and infected episiotomy/laceration presenting with organ or space perineal infection (one study, 3420 women; low-certainty evidence).

The impact on maternal adverse reactions (one study, 2593 women; low-certainty evidence) and maternal length of stay in hospital (one study, 393 women; low-certainty evidence) was also unclear due to the low-certainty of the study. Perineal pain and health consequences of perineal pain were slightly reduced. Prophylactic antibiotics did not have a clear effect on pain during sex and breastfeeding at six weeks. Maternal hospital re-admission and maternal health-related quality of life may be slightly improved. Costs were reduced with use of prophylactic antibiotics. Neither study specifically measured fever, urinary tract infection or adverse reactions in babies. Prophylactic antibiotics into a vein are effective in reducing ill-health caused by infections in women undergoing operative vaginal deliveries, and who do not have clinical indications for antibiotic administration. The evidence was mainly from a single study in a high-income country. Well-designed randomised studies in other settings are required to confirm this finding.
This review examined 22 randomised clinical trials where 2902 women took part in the studies; 1499 in the CHM group and 1403 in the control group which might include a placebo (non-active compound made to look, taste and smell the same as the study compound) or a drug or HT or another CHM formula (different from the one being tested). Most of the studies had a trial period for 12 weeks. The data are current to March 2015. We found insufficient evidence that CHM were any more or less effective than placebo or HT for the relief of vasomotor symptoms. Adverse effects were not well reported, some women taking CHM reported mild diarrhoea, breast tenderness, gastric discomfort and an unpleasant taste. Effects on safety were inconclusive. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The studies did not produce good quality evidence to allow the authors to draw a conclusive statement regarding the effectiveness or safety of CHM.
We looked for studies that compared strategies to support the implementation of health-promoting policies and practices in workplaces versus either no implementation strategy or different implementation strategies. Implementation strategies could include quality improvement initiatives, education, and training, among others. They could target policies or practices directly instituted in the workplace (e.g. workplace healthy catering policy), as well as workplace-led efforts to encourage the use of external health promotion services (e.g. employee gym membership subsidies).
We found six eligible studies that investigated these strategies. Most took place in the USA, and workplaces were in the manufacturing, industrial and services-based sectors. The number of workplaces examined in the studies ranged from 12 to 114. Implementation strategies in the six studies targeted different workplace policies and practices: healthy catering; point-of-purchase nutrition labelling; environmental prompts and supports for healthy eating and physical activity; tobacco control policies; sponsorship of employee weight management programmes; and adherence to national guidelines for staff health promotion. All studies used multiple strategies to improve the implementation of these policies and practices, including: educational meetings, interventions tailored to the specific needs of the workplace, and workplace consensus processes to implement a policy or practice. Four studies compared implementation strategies versus no intervention, one study compared different implementation strategies, and one study compared two implementation strategies with each other and a control. Researchers used surveys, audits and observations in workplaces to evaluate the effect of the strategies on the implementation of workplace policies and practices. The evidence is current to 31 August 2017. When we combined findings from three studies, we did not find any difference in the level of implementation of health-promoting policies or practices between workplaces that received implementation strategy support versus those that did not, indicating that these strategies may make little to no difference. In the two trials comparing different implementation strategies, both reported improvements in implementation, favouring the more intensive implementation support group. Findings for effects on employee health behaviours were inconsistent and based on very low to low certainty evidence, so it is unclear whether the implementation strategies improved these outcomes. One of the included studies reported on cost, and none on the unintended adverse consequences of implementation strategies. There were few included studies, and they used inconsistent terminology to describe implementation strategies, limiting the strength of the evidence. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low for the effect of implementation strategies on policy and practice implementation, based on four randomised studies (where groups are randomly assigned to different study groups), and very low based on two non-randomised studies. We also graded evidence on employee health behaviours and cost outcomes as low and very low. The findings of the review do not provide clear evidence regarding the impact of implementation strategies on workplace health-promoting policy and practice implementation or on employee health behaviours. Further research is needed.
The five randomised controlled trials identified by the review authors from the medical literature looked at the antiepileptic drugs phenytoin, phenobarbital, and divalproex sodium. There was no difference between treatment with these antiepileptic drugs and placebo, or observing the patient, in preventing a first seizure in 404 people with brain tumors. The risk of an adverse event was higher for those on antiepileptic drugs (number needed to be treated to cause a harm in one person (NNH) 3). The types of adverse effects when reported in these trials were nausea, skin rash, sore gums, myelosuppression, vertigo, blurred vision, tremor, and gait unsteadiness. 
The length of follow up was short in one study. No studies were identified for any of the newer antiepileptic drugs.
Review authors found 21 relevant studies giving information on 7893 frail, older people across 10 countries and four continents. The review shows that older people who underwent CGA rather than usual medical care did not have a significantly lower risk of death overall.
While the chances of being admitted to a nursing home did not appear to change, there is low-quality evidence showing there may be a lower risk of being admitted to hospital in people who received CGA.
While CGA did not appear to affect the need to visit the emergency department or of falls, there were insufficient studies looking at these for us to draw any conclusions.
We searched for studies up to April 2020.
We searched several medical databases to find studies that assessed the impact of restricting access to means of suicide on roads. We searched the databases up to March 2020. We also searched international trial registries for unpublished and ongoing studies. Our main outcomes of interest were suicide and attempted suicide or self-harm. We found no studies eligible for inclusion in the review. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the effectiveness of means restriction interventions for the prevention of suicide on roads. Determining suicidal intent is a major problem in road crash fatalities, therefore clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up, study and understand this method of suicide more accurately. Improved awareness of suicide on roads in suicide prevention activities is needed, as well as, its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Robust studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads are urgently required
Five studies comparing vitamins C and E versus placebo (no vitamins C and E) in 214 people with asthma or exercise-induced breathlessness were included in this review. Four studies included adults, and one included children. The very limited number of studies available for review and their different designs meant that we were only able to describe individual studies, rather than pooling their results to determine an average result. In most study reports, the design was not well described; therefore it was impossible to assess the risk of bias for most of the studies. In terms of our key outcomes, very few relevant data were provided by the trial authors. We found no indication of benefit in the studies that considered vitamins C and E in relation to asthma. However, at this stage, it is not possible to form any clear conclusions based on these findings, as available evidence is insufficient to allow proper assessment of the use of vitamins C and E as treatment for patients with asthma. Additional well-designed research is required to answer this question. How patients were allocated to receive either vitamins C and E or placebo was not clearly described in any of the five included studies. This may mean that the studies were not well randomised, which can affect the results. A second concern is that the designs of the studies were different, which means that we cannot be certain that the studies were measuring the same thing. By taking this into account, we judged the evidence in this review overall to be of low to moderate quality.
In 2009 we identified 14 studies, enrolling 2086 patients, and found that while statins were generally safe and reduced cholesterol levels, they did not prevent death or clinical cardiac events in people treated with dialysis. This latest update analysed a total or 25 studies (8289 patients), and included the results from two new large studies. We found that statins lowered cholesterol in people treated with dialysis but did not prevent death, heart attack, or stroke.
Evidence for side-effects was incomplete, and potential harms from statin therapy remain uncertain. Current study data did not address whether statin treatment should be stopped when a person starts dialysis, although the benefits associated with continued treatment are likely to be small. Limited information was available for people treated with peritoneal dialysis, suggesting that more research is needed in this setting.
This review aimed to demonstrate whether the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in ear surgery can be helpful in reducing postoperative complications in clean or clean-contaminated surgery. There is no current evidence from randomised controlled trials showing that there is any antibiotic substance, in any regime, which can contribute to reducing complications in any type of clean or clean-contaminated surgical procedure in the ear.
Our findings are based on two large studies with 3375 participants and should be applicable to most women having treatment for DCIS. Overall tamoxifen did reduce the number of future cancers or DCIS in either breast. However, women taking tamoxifen did not live longer than those who did not take it. A total of 15 women would have to take tamoxifen after treatment of DCIS for one woman to experience a benefit (i.e. no future cancers or DCIS in either breast after taking tamoxifen for five years). There are side effects of tamoxifen treatment such as blood clotting problems (stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and endometrial cancer. However, no risk/benefit conclusions are possible because there was limited information about the side effects in this review. The effects of tamoxifen may have been 'diluted' by the effects of radiotherapy. This review cannot recommend which women might have more benefit from using tamoxifen in terms of age, menopausal status or type of DCIS (oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive versus ER-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive or HER2-negative DCIS).
The evidence is current to March 2016. We did not find any trials in adult populations and included three trials involving 420 children. All trials were set in countries where death rates for meningitis are high. In one study no funding source was mentioned. The remaining two studies were funded jointly by pharmaceutical concerns with government agencies and a charitable agency. No studies reported important healthcare outcomes such as duration of hospital stay, raised intracranial pressure, or status epilepticus. An adverse effect in children with restricted fluid intake was that they were less likely to have low levels of sodium in their blood and therefore they would experience greater reductions in body fluids. An adverse effect of unrestricted fluid administration was reported in one study as short-term swelling of the face and low blood sodium levels one to two days after fluids were started, although the largest study found no difference in blood sodium levels. Quality of the evidenceAnalysis of available trials found low quality evidence that there is no significant difference between maintenance versus restrictive fluid regimens for the outcome of death and acute severe neurological complications. There was also some evidence favouring maintenance fluid therapy over restricted fluids for chronic severe neurological events at three months follow-up, but the quality was very low.
This methodology review identified five studies that investigated the extent to which the publication of clinical trials (such as those approved by an ethics review board) is influenced by the statistical significance or direction of a trial's results. These studies showed that trials with positive findings (defined either as those that were statistically significant (P < 0.05), or those findings perceived to be important or striking, or those indicating a positive direction of treatment effect), had nearly four times the odds of being published compared to findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction of treatment effect. This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published.Two studies found that trials with positive findings also tended to be published more quickly than trials with negative findings. The size of the trial (assessed in three studies) and the source of funding, academic rank, and sex of the principal investigator (assessed in one study) did not appear to influence whether a trial was published.
These results provide support for mandating that clinical trials are registered before recruiting participants so that review authors know about all potentially eligible studies, regardless of their findings. Those carrying out systematic reviews should ensure they assess the potential problems of publication bias in their review and consider methods for addressing this issue by ensuring a comprehensive search for both published and unpublished trials.
This review found that in the short term PPIs relieve heartburn better than H2RAs in patients who are treated without specific diagnostic testing. Although the difference is smaller, this is also true for patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), who have a normal upper endoscopy . In summary, proton pump inhibitor drugs appear to be more effective than H2-receptor antagonists for relieving heartburn.
We looked for research up to 13 May 2013 and included 33 trials in our analyses. Twenty-two trials compared outcomes for children given a lactose-free feed with those for children given a lactose-containing feed and 11 trials compared outcomes for children fed a diluted milk feed with those for children given an undiluted milk feed.
We found evidence that feeds that do not contain lactose may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by an average of about 18 hours (low quality evidence ). Lactose-free feeds probably lower the risk of children having prolonged or worsening diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence).
We did not find any evidence that diluted milk feeds reduce the duration of diarrhoea (low quality evidence ) but these feeds may lower the risk of children having prolonged or worsening diarrhoea (low quality evidence).
The majority of trials excluded breast fed infants, and none were conducted in low-income countries where diarrhoea can cause death, so the review is relevant to infants and young children who are receiving formula or are weaned in high- and middle-income countries.
Some studies suggest that selenium supplementation for people with chronic asthma may help to improve symptoms. This review found some evidence from only one small trial that selenium supplementation might help reduce symptoms of chronic asthma symptoms, but more research is needed to be certain.
We identified 27 trials with a total of 10,187 participants in searches conducted up to November 2013. Most data come from trials testing one drug (recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator, rt-PA) given into a vein up to six hours after acute ischaemic stroke, but several other drugs were also tested and at different times to treatment after stroke and given into an artery in the brain rather than into a vein in the arm. All trials compared a clot-dissolving drug with a placebo (control) group. Most trials included participants with moderate to severe stroke. All trials took place in hospitals that were used to treating people with stroke. Differences between trials mean that not all trials contribute information to all outcomes, but we have used all available data. Most trials included participants after a computed tomography (CT) brain scan had excluded a brain haemorrhage as the cause of symptoms (a few trials used magnetic resonance brain scanning instead). There is general agreement between the earlier trials and the one recent trial added in this update (IST-3) for all main outcomes, and between the 12 trials that tested rt-PA and the 15 trials that tested other clot-dissolving drugs. The main difference between IST-3 and earlier trials was that IST-3 had many participants above 80 years. Clot-dissolving treatment can reduce the risk of long-term dependency on others for daily activities, in spite of there being an increased risk of bleeding in the brain which also increased the risk of early death. Once the early bleeding risk had passed, at three or six months after stroke, people given clot-dissolving drugs were more likely to have recovered from their stroke and to be independent, especially if they had been treated within the first three hours after stroke. Older people benefited as much as younger people. Giving aspirin at the same time as clot-busting drugs increased the risk of bleeding and should be avoided. Further analyses of individual patient data factors such as findings on brain scanning before treatment, and of different ways of giving the treatment, may give more information than the summary data that we used here. Meantime, people who think that they are experiencing a stroke should get to hospital quickly, be assessed by a stroke doctor, have a brain scan and receive clot-dissolving treatment as fast as possible. They should not hesitate by thinking that they will be 'too old' for treatment. The treatment is very effective if started within three hours of stroke and definitely improves outcome if given up to 4.5 hours after stroke, but later than that the effects are less clear and are still being tested in trials. More information is needed from trials in people with mild stroke to see if the benefit of clot-dissolving drugs outweighs the risk of haemorrhage. The evidence comes mostly from well-conducted randomised trials run by stroke experts. Some trials (8/27) were run by companies that make the clot-dissolving drugs, but most trials (19/27, including most participants) were funded by Government or charity sources independently of drug companies. These results apply to a wide range of people with a wide range of severities of stroke and other medical conditions.
The evidence is current to May 2017. We included eight studies and 334 participants related to five different classes of medicines sometimes recommended for HAI prevention. These medicines included those that mimic the action of serotonin at selected sites (selective 5-hydroxytryptamine(1) receptor agonists), medicines that regulate the action of calcium (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist), medicines that promote dilation of the blood vessels (endothelin-1 antagonist), medicines that prevent a neuron (nerve cell) from 'firing' (initiating an action) and convulsions from developing (anticonvulsant medicines), as well as medicines that regulate the body´s sodium and water levels (spironolactone). All studies were undertaken in high altitude mountain areas. The participants ranged between 16 and 65 years of age. Only one study included people at a high risk of this condition due to their history of HAI. Four trials provided the intervention between one to three days prior to the ascent (50%), and three trials less than 24 hours prior (37.5%). The participants in all these studies reached a final altitude of between 3500 and 5895 metres above sea level. Only one of the eight included studies did not provide clear information about the source of funding (12.5%). Twenty-four additional studies were classified as ongoing (12), or awaiting classification (12; unable to obtain full texts). The assessment of the less commonly used pharmacological interventions suggest that there is a scarcity of evidence related to these interventions. For most of the assessed comparisons, we only found evidence from a single study. Clinical benefits and harms related to potential interventions such as sumatriptan are still unclear. The quality of the evidence was rated from low to very low. Several studies had quality shortcomings such as only having small sample sizes and therefore generating uncertain results. For most of the medicines evaluated, additional research is required to clarify their effectiveness and safety.
The review of trials found five studies, involving 71,458 women, comparing two fetal movement counting methods, fetal movement counting versus hormonal analysis and routine fetal movement counting compared with standard antenatal care, as defined by trial authors. In studies that compared routine counting of baby's movements in the womb with mixed or undefined counting, there was no difference in stillbirths, caesarean sections, birth weight less than 10th centile and mother-baby attachment; there was reduction in women's anxiety in the group counting the baby's movements. There was a tendency to more antenatal admissions. When counting of baby's movement was compared with hormonal analysis, there were fewer hospital visits among women who were counting and fewer babies in the hormonal analysis group had low Apgar scores, which assess the baby's condition after birth. There was no difference between the groups in terms of caesarean sections done and other outcomes. 'Perinatal death or severe morbidity' was not reported. When different types of fetal movement counting methods (once a day compared to more than once a day) were compared, women were more compliant in using the once a day counting method, citing less interruption with daily activities as one of the reasons; the incidence of caesarean section did not differ and perinatal death or severe illness was not reported. The numbers and the methodological quality of studies were insufficient to assess stillbirths accurately. Further trials are suggested, and it would be very important to assess women's anxiety and views in addition to the ability of the counting to prevent stillbirths.

A search for relevant randomised studies was conducted in January 2013. The review includes three studies with 80 participants. All participants had tardive dyskinesia as a result of taking antipsychotic medication and were randomised into treatment groups. One group received pyridoxal 5 phosphate, the other group received a placebo. Antipsychotic treatment continued as usual throughout the trials. .
People taking pyridoxal 5 phosphate in these studies experienced more than 40% improvement in their tardive dyskinesia compared to those on placebo, so had less severe tardive dyskinesia. Experience of side effects were similar between treatment groups with participants taking pyridoxal 5 phosphate experiencing no more or less side effects than participants in the placebo group and they did not experience greater worsening of their psychiatric symptoms than those on placebo. Evidence from the studies is weak, but suggests pyridoxal 5 phosphate may be effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. .
Evidence is weak. The number of studies and participants is few. The quality of studies is low. Better evidence could be gathered by better designed, conducted and reported trials.

The evidence is current up to October 2020. We included six studies with a total of 275 participants; five studies were related to people with stable disease. No studies involving children were found. Exercise training was delivered in combination with other treatments such as airway clearance therapy, respiratory muscle training, and/or education. Participants were randomly assigned to exercise training or no exercise training. Exercise training was performed for at least six weeks, either in a group setting or at home. None of the included studies were funded by companies with commercial interests in study findings. Following completion of exercise training, participants in a stable clinical state walked farther than those who did not do exercise training (an average of 87 metres farther), but our certainty of the evidence is low. Participants also reported improved quality of life (low-certainty evidence) and less shortness of breath and fatigue. We found evidence of moderate certainty showing that exercise training might not specifically improve cough-related symptoms, although the incidence of acute exacerbations was lower. Evidence was insufficient to show if the effects of exercise training would last beyond the period of exercise training, and no evidence was available to determine whether exercise training helps people become physically active. No benefits were observed for people who undertook exercise training soon after an acute flare-up of their bronchiectasis. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate due to uncertainty regarding the true size of observed benefits, poorly conducted studies, and an overall lack of sufficient data. More studies with larger participant numbers are required to determine the long-term effects of exercise training, irrespective of clinical status.
All included studies were randomised controlled trials involving adults (18 years of age and older) with symptomatic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. One study, including 320 participants from the USA compared arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) and physical therapy (home-based exercises) to physical therapy (PT) alone. One study, including 32 participants from the USA, compared arthroscopic surgery (debridement ± synovectomy ± chondroplasty) to closed needle joint lavage with saline. Two studies, including 152 participants (120 from Pakistan, 32 from the UK) compared arthroscopic surgery (washout ± debridement, debridement) to a hyaluronic acid injection. One study, including 62 participants from the Netherlands, compared high tibial osteotomy surgery to knee joint distraction surgery. One study was supported by grant 9040 from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, by the NIH (NIAMS) and by the Percy Surgical Research Trust of Lutheran General Hospital. One study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. One study was funded by ZonMw (The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development). Two studies did not report any funding source. Due to space constraints, reporting of results is restricted to the primary comparison, arthroscopic partial meniscectomy surgery versus a six-week progressive home-based exercise intervention for the knee, at 12 months:
Pain (lower score means less pain):
Improved by 0.2% with surgery (4% better to 4% worse) on a 0 to 100 point scale
- People who had surgery rated their pain as 19.1 points.
- People who had physical therapy rated their pain as 19.3 points.
Function (lower score means better function):
Improved by 0.8 % with surgery (4% better to 3% worse)
- People who had surgery rated their function as 13.7.
- People who had physical therapy rated their function as 14.5.
Serious adverse events:
Increased by 1% with surgery (2% better to 3% worse)
- 3 people out of 156 had a serious adverse event with surgery including fatal blood clot, heart attack and low blood oxygen levels.
- 2 people out of 164 had a serious adverse event with physical therapy including sudden death and stroke.
Conversion to total knee replacement:
- Five participants in the APM group (30 per 1,000) and three subjects in the PT group (17 per 1,000) underwent total knee replacement.
Withdrawals
- One subject died in each group. Low-quality evidence (downgraded due to biases in the study design and small sample size) indicates there may be little or no benefit of surgery over progressive exercise in terms of pain and function. Arthroscopic surgery may not have any benefits over closed needle joint lavage with saline or hyaluronic acid injection, and surgery to realign non-diseased bone surfaces (osteotomy) may have little or no benefit over surgery to separate diseased bone joint surfaces (knee joint distraction) as there was only low-quality evidence at best from single or two small studies.
Due to the very low adverse event rates, it is not clear if surgery is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, incidence of total knee replacement or withdrawal rates.
Osteoarthritis progression and quality of life were not measured. There was low-quality evidence that there may be little difference between arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and a home exercise program for the treatment of mild to moderate osteoarthritis. Similarly, surgery may not be better than other interventions to treat this condition, as indicated by low-quality evidence from a few small trials.
Eight of the trials looked at email compared with standard methods of communication. Where email was compared to standard methods of communication we found that we could not properly determine what effect email was having on patient/caregiver outcomes, as there were missing data and the results of the different studies varied. For health service use outcomes the situation was the same, but some results seemed to show that an email intervention may lead to an increased number of emails and telephone calls being received by healthcare professionals.
One of the trials looked at email counselling compared with telephone counselling. We found that it only looked at patient outcomes, and found few differences between groups. Where there were differences these showed that telephone counselling leads to greater changes in lifestyle than email counselling.
None of the trials measured how email affects healthcare professionals and only one measured whether email can cause harm. All of the trials were biased in some way and when we measured the quality of all of the results we found them to be of low or very low quality. As a result the results of this review should be viewed with caution.
The nature of the results means that we cannot make any recommendations for how email might best be used in clinical practice. Future research should make allowances for how quickly technology changes, and should consider how much email would cost to introduce and what effect it has on the use of healthcare resources. Research reports should be sure to clearly report their methods and findings, and researchers interested in carrying out research in this area should be assisted in developing ideas and put them into action.
We wanted to find out if omega-3 fatty acid supplements were better than dummy treatments (that do not contain any omega-3) or alternative treatments to improve:
· Quality of life
· Walking distance
· Blood flow in the legs
· Cholesterol and triglyceride levels
· Blood pressure
· Number of angioplasties (opening blocked or narrowed arteries) or surgical repairs
We also wanted to find out if omega -3 was associated with any unwanted side effects. We searched for studies that examined omega-3 fatty acids compared with dummy treatments or alternative therapies in people with intermittent claudication. We wanted to find out if omega-3 supplements were better than dummy treatments or alternative therapies to improve the outcomes.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes. We found 15 studies involving 1830 people with symptoms of intermittent claudication, lower limb arterial disease, or both. There were 971 people in the largest study and 18 in the smallest. Study locations included the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States, and Spain. The average age of people who participated was between 62 and 69 years. Four studies only recruited men.
Omega-3 fish oil supplements were used in 11 studies, and foods containing omega-3 were used in the other four studies. Different dosages were used. Studies lasted between four weeks and approximately six years. All except one used a dummy treatment for comparison. Some were funded by the manufacturers of omega-3 supplements and food. Compared with no omega-3 supplements:
Omega-3 supplements may have little to no effect on quality of life, walking distance, blood flow in the leg, or the amount of angioplasty, surgical repair, or amputation, but we are very uncertain about the results.
Omega-3 may have little to no effect on cholesterol or triglyceride blood levels, or blood pressure.
There did not appear to be any difference in fatal or non-fatal circulation-related problems between people taking omega-3 and those not taking omega-3, but we are very uncertain about the results.
Only 7 studies reported whether people experienced unwanted side effects, such as an upset stomach or headache. The evidence suggests there is little to no difference between those who took omega-3 and those who did not take omega-3 for side events. Our confidence in the evidence for each of the most important outcomes was very low to low. This was because of the way the studies were designed, the small numbers of people involved, and the differences in results between studies. Many studies also reported their results in a way that meant we could not include them in our statistical analyses. The evidence is up-to-date to 19 April 2024.
We included 32 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with 3304 participants, of which only 19 reported data suitable for analysis.
All studies took place in a clinical setting. The age of the participants ranged from 33 to 61 years. Studies took place in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Greece, India, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, UK, USA. Baseline pain scores in all groups were relatively low. The evidence is current to September 2016.  -quality evidence of a clinically meaningful difference in safety or effectiveness between different types of pain relief compared with each other or with placebo or no treatment in women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in most of the domains assessed. The evidence was low or very low quality, mainly due to risk of bias and imprecision.
In this review, nine studies evaluating various non drug treatments to treat spasticity in adult with MS were included, comprising a total of 341 participants. Results from these studies suggest that all included non pharmacological therapies have low level of evidence or no evidence in improving spasticity in people with MS. However, caution should be used in the interpretation of the results, due to the poor methodological quality of all the included studies. More research is needed to determine the usefulness of these interventions before they can be recommended as routine treatments.
Non-epileptic attacks look like epileptic seizures but they are not caused by epilepsy. There have been many investigations of the causes, but evidence about successful treatment is less available. We reviewed the existing studies treating people having non-epileptic attacks. We found 12 studies looking at different types of treatment such as psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnosis. Three hundred and forty three participants were recruited to these 12 studies. Four studies were randomised controlled trials, and 8 were non-randomised studies. Most of the controlled trials included patients with other diagnoses as well as non-epileptic attacks. Most of the non-randomised studies included patients with mainly non-epileptic attacks. Most included studies reported improved outcomes for the treatment they were investigating. One randomised trial investigating Cognitive Behavioural Therapy found that seizures were significantly reduced. Due to the variety of treatments and designs of the included studies, it was not possible to combine the results to produce an overall outcome for our review.
Many of the studies did not use satisfactory methods which meant that the evidence was rated as high risk of bias. The overall evidence for the main outcome of reducing seizures as a result of treatment is not considered reliable except in one study. Our conclusion is there is little reliable evidence to support the use of any treatment for people with non-epileptic attacks. The evidence in this review is up to date as from 4 February 2013.
The evidence is current to January 2017. We identified six studies with a total of 557 participants. The studies were blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trials that tested how effective the NTHi vaccine is in preventing infections in people over 18 years of age with COPD or chronic bronchitis. In all six trials, both the vaccine and placebo group were given at least three courses of tablets at regular intervals over a period of three to 12 months. Generally, the baseline demographics of participants across the included studies shared similar characteristics (such as diet, lifestyle, and living conditions) to other high-income countries. Ages ranged between 40 and 80 years. The studies counted the number of infections the participants experienced, levels of respiratory tract bacteria, deaths, side effects, hospital admissions, or treatment with antibiotics. The NTHi vaccine had no significant impact on reducing the number of acute exacerbations experienced by people with COPD. There was no significant difference in mortality rate between the vaccine and placebo groups, and the reported deaths in the vaccinated group were not attributed to the vaccine.
The levels of H influenzae bacteria found in the respiratory tracts of participants did not differ between the vaccine and placebo groups. Due to inconsistencies of measurement between the trials, we were not able to compare the studies against one another.
Antibiotics, which can be an indicator of severe infection, were significantly more commonly prescribed in the placebo group. Evidence of hospital admissions showed that there was no difference in the likelihood of being hospitalised in either the vaccine or the placebo group. Two trials studying quality of life found that vaccinated participants generally had a better quality of life, but these results were measured differently and so could not be compared.
Five trials reported adverse effects, but there was no particular association with either the vaccine or placebo group. Further research is needed to define adverse effects as outcome measures for more definitive analyses regarding vaccine side effects. The studies were well conducted with moderate risk of bias. The main limitation of this review was the lack of consistency regarding the definitions and outcome measures among the individual studies, which affected the overall synthesis and interpretation of the results. Fewer participants may mean the results are more likely to be affected by chance. One trial had more participants than the other five trials combined, and it contributed more to the final analysis. There was moderate heterogeneity (the studies showed quite different results) when this study was included in the analysis, especially in numbers of infections. However, the results were consistent and did not change when this study was removed from the analysis. We concluded after reviewing the relevant studies that the H influenzae vaccine taken orally in people with chronic bronchitis and COPD does not have a significant reduction in the number and severity of acute exacerbations.
We included six trials (involving 800 women) in this review. We found that the application of a skin preparation to the areas affected by stretch marks during pregnancy did not prevent the development of stretch marks in the women during pregnancy. Only three trials (involving 461 women) looked at the severity of the stretch marks and did not show a clear difference. The preparations used included Alphastria, Trofolastin, Verum, olive oil and cocoa butter, which all contain vitamin E; Alphastria and Verum also have hyaluronic acid. Of the six trials, we judged three to be at low risk of bias. All trials were relatively small, with four of the six trials each including less than 100 women. The trials were also different in terms of when the women first started to use the topical applications, ranging from the first trimester to the first 20 weeks.
We wanted to know whether ataluren can improve the quality of life and lung function of people with CF, and whether it can do so without any side effects. We also wanted to measure the effects on lung infections (need for hospital visits or additional antibiotics), survival, nutritional status (weight, body mass index and height) and whether treatment was cost-effective. We searched for trials that directly compared drugs such as ataluren to placebo (treatment not containing an active drug) or to a different treatment for these specific genetic mutations in any people with CF. We found two trials including 517 people (males and females between 6 and 53 years of age) comparing ataluren to a placebo. The trials lasted 48 weeks and everyone taking part in the trials had at least one gene with a class I mutation. In people taking ataluren, there was no improvement in clinical outcomes such as quality of life, lung function, exacerbations (flare up of disease), sweat chloride (salt) levels or weight compared with people taking placebo. The trials found that kidney damage was more common in people taking ataluren.
The earlier trial analysed their results in a way not originally planned to see whether the effects of ataluren and placebo were different in people using inhaled tobramycin (an antibiotic) on a long-term basis compared with people not taking the inhaled antibiotic. In people taking ataluren but not using inhaled tobramycin, lung function declined at a slower rate and there were fewer exacerbations than in people in the placebo group also not using inhaled tobramycin. The later trial specifically recruited people not taking tobramycin to see whether this really was an effect of the antibiotic, but the investigators did not find any difference between the ataluren and placebo groups for changes in lung function or exacerbations. This suggests that the earlier results occurred by chance.
There were no deaths and we did not find any differences between ataluren and placebo in side effects or nutritional status. Neither trial reported on hospitalisations, extra courses of antibiotics or cost-effectiveness.
We have not found enough high-quality evidence to determine the effect of ataluren for treating CF. We recommend that future trials are designed and reported clearly so that their results can be included in a systematic review. We are moderately confident in our findings, but there is some uncertainty due to how widely the results varied between participants. We are satisfied that everyone taking part had an equal chance of being in either group (ataluren or placebo) and that no one could work out which group the next person would be put into (so that healthier people did not receive the treatment and make the results seem better). We believe that the clinicians running the trials and those taking part in the trials did not know which treatment each person was receiving. We have some concerns about the emphasis the investigators of one trial placed on the results of a comparison they had not planned (the use of long-term inhaled tobramycin). Unfortunately, that trial did not report all its results clearly. Sometimes, the results were reported in a way that meant they could not be used in this review, and sometimes the information was not reported at all. This affected our confidence in the overall results. Both trials were sponsored by PTC Therapeutics Incorporated, who make ataluren. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development and the US National Institutes of Health also supported the trials. We last searched for evidence on 4 October 2022.
We identified five studies including 523 participants that reported the diagnostic test accuracy of ultrasound. One of these studies, involving 262 participants, also reported the diagnostic test accuracy of serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase. All the studies included people with symptoms. One study included only participants who had not undergone previous cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder). This information was not available from the remaining studies. Based on an average sensitivity of 73% for ultrasound, we would expect that on average 73 out of 100 people with common bile duct stones will be detected while the remaining 27 people will be missed and will not receive appropriate treatment. The average number of people with common bile duct stones detected using ultrasound may vary between 44 and 90 out of 100 people. Based on an average specificity of 91% for ultrasound, we would expect that on average 91 out of 100 people without common bile duct stones would be identified as not having common bile duct stones; 9 out of 100 would be false positives and not receive appropriate treatment. The average number of false positives could vary between 5 and 16 out of 100 people.
Evidence from one study suggested that using a level of serum alkaline phosphatase higher than 125 units to distinguish between people who have and people who do not have common bile duct stones gave better diagnostic accuracy than using a level twice the normal limit (which usually ranges between 0 and 40). The study also showed better accuracy for serum alkaline phosphatase compared to serum bilirubin.
The sensitivity of serum alkaline phosphatase at the 125 units cut-off was 92%, which means that 92 out of 100 people with common bile duct stones would be detected but 8 out of 100 people will be missed. The number detected could vary between 74 and 99 out of 100 people. Based on the specificity of 79%, 79 out of 100 people without common bile duct stones will be correctly identified as not having common bile duct stones while the remaining 21 people will be false positives. The number of false positives could vary between 16 and 26 out of 100 people. This suggests that further non-invasive tests may be useful to diagnose common bile duct stones prior to the use of invasive tests. All the studies were of low methodological quality, which may undermine the validity of our findings. Further studies of high methodological quality are necessary.
This review of three studies, including 132 participants, suggests that further high quality research is required before specific treatment techniques can be accepted or rejected. Patients with apraxia should continue to receive general stroke rehabilitation services but better quality research is needed to identify optimal apraxia treatments.
The review authors summarised information from one clinical trial that compared botulinum toxin to a placebo, to treat tics in adults with Tourette’s syndrome. We found one small study. The study was limited by the number of participants (N = 18), who mainly had mild tics. We are very uncertain about the effects of botulinum toxin injections on reducing tic frequency and severity, and measures of overall well-being. Some participants experienced harms, which included weakness, restlessness, and neck discomfort following the injection. We do not know from the study whether participants who received the injection developed resistance to the botulinum injections, which would make them less effective over time.
The evidence is current to 25 October 2017.
We searched for relevant research articles, and found 75 trials (4507 participants, mostly female, mean age ranging from 14.8 to 45.7 years). The trials examined a wide variety of psychological treatments (over 16 different types). They were mostly conducted in outpatient settings, and lasted between one and 36 months. Dialectical behaviour Therapy (DBT) and Mentalisation-Based Treatment (MBT) were the therapies most studied.
Psychotherapy compared with usual treatment
Psychotherapy reduced the severity of BPD symptoms and suicidality and may reduce self-harm and depression whilst also improving psychological functioning compared to usual treatment. DBT may be better than usual treatment at reducing BPD severity, self-harm and improving psychosocial functioning. Similarly, MBT appears to be more effective than usual treatment at reducing self-harm, suicidality and depression. However, these findings were all based on low-quality evidence and therefore we are uncertain whether or not these results would change if we added more trials. Most trials did not report adverse effects, and those that did, found no obvious unwanted reactions following psychological treatment. The majority of trials (64 out of 75) were funded by grants from universities, authorities or research foundations. Four trials reported that no funding was received. For the remaining trials (7), funding was not specified.
Psychotherapy versus waiting list or no treatment
Psychotherapy was more effective than waiting list at improving BPD symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and depression, but there was no clear difference between psychotherapy, and waiting list for outcomes of self-harm, and suicide-related outcomes. In general, psychotherapy may be more effective than usual treatment in reducing BPD symptom severity, self-harm, suicide-related outcomes and depression, whilst also improving psychosocial functioning. However, only the decrease in BPD symptom severity was found to be at a clinically important level. DBT appears to be better at reducing BPD severity, self-harm, and improving psychosocial functioning compared to usual treatment and MBT appears more effective than usual treatment at reducing self-harm and suicidality. However, we are still uncertain about these findings as the quality of the evidence is low.
We found 40 studies including 4793 people who had shock wave treatment to break up their kidney stones. Most of the studies were done in Asia; some were in Europe, Africa and South America. Most studies did not report their sources of funding.
The studies compared giving an alpha-blocker with giving a placebo (dummy) treatment or usual care (could include antibiotics, painkillers and fluids given by mouth or through a drip).
Tamsulosin was the most commonly studied alpha-blocker; the others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin. Compared with usual care or a placebo treatment, alpha-blockers may:
clear kidney stones in more people: in 111 more people for every 1000 people treated (36 studies);
clear stones faster: by nearly four days (14 studies);
reduce the need for extra treatments to clear stones: in 32 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (12 studies); and
cause fewer unwanted effects: affecting 103 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (seven studies).
Most unwanted effects were emergency visits to hospitals, and people going back into hospital for stone related problems. Unwanted effects were more common in people who had usual care or a placebo treatment than in people given alpha-blockers.
None of the studies looked at people's quality of life (well-being). We are uncertain about these results because they were based on studies in which it was unclear how people were chosen to take part; it was unclear if results were reported fully; some results were inconsistent and in some studies the results varied widely.  Our results are likely to change if further evidence becomes available. Giving an alpha-blocker after shock wave treatment to break up kidney stones might clear the fragments faster, in more people and reduce the need for extra treatments. Alpha‑blockers might cause fewer unwanted effects than usual care or a placebo.
We searched for studies that compared secondary cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone in women with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. Although we checked 1431 possible articles, we found no relevant studies. Therefore there is currently no evidence to determine if secondary cytoreductive surgery is better or worse than chemotherapy alone in terms of prolonging life.
The review highlights the need for good quality studies comparing secondary cytoreductive surgery to chemotherapy. The results of the ongoing RCT AGO-OVAR OP.4 (DESKTOP III) is awaited.
We wanted to know whether MST helps people with schizophrenia.
We were interested in:
- number of people with symptoms improved;
- number of people with impaired cognitive function;
- number of people with clinically important side effects. We searched for studies that investigated the effect of MST compared to any other treatments for people with schizophrenia.
We compared and summarised the results of the study and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.  We found one short-term randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 79 adults that met the review requirements. It compared MST plus standard care to ECT plus standard care. Our findings were based on very limited data. We found that MST and ECT may be comparable in improving the global state of people with schizophrenia, and in improving the overall, positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. MST may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration and may improve cognitive function compared to ECT. There may be no difference between the two groups in terms of leaving the study early due to any reason, adverse effects, or inefficacy. We cannot conclude whether MST is helpful or safe for people with schizophrenia based on limited data. Well-designed RCTs are warranted to answer the question. The evidence is up-to-date to 06 March 2022.
Four randomized controlled studies were included in the review; individual studies suggest that educational and counselling interventions may encourage women to abstain from alcohol or reduce the amount of alcohol they drink in pregnancy. The studies involved women who were less than 28 weeks pregnant who were consuming some alcohol. All were carried out in the USA. The interventions ranged from a 10-minute education session and provision of a self-help manual through to an hour-long motivational interview with reinforcement at each prenatal visit. Women in the control groups generally received routine care, which may have included advice on reducing alcohol intake. Outcomes were measured in different ways, and so results have been presented separately for each study. The studies provided very limited information on the effects of interventions on the health of women and their babies.
There was very little information provided in these studies on the effects of interventions on the health of mothers and babies. There is an urgent need for more information in this area.
We wanted to discover whether the use of macrolide antibiotics (usually taken orally) affected the health of people with CF and whether these drugs have any side effects. We searched for studiesthat looked at the effects of macrolide antibiotics in children and adults with CF and summarised the evidence. We found 14 studies, which put the total of 1467 children and adults into different treatment groups at random, which we included in this review. Eleven studies compared azithromycin to placebo, one compared two different doses of azithromycin (high versus low dose), one compared inhaled azithromycin to oral azithromycin, and one compared oral azithromycin once a week to once a day. We found that there was a slight improvement in lung function in people that were given azithromycin compared to a placebo at six months and also that the risk of a flare-up of infection was lower. The risk of side effects (such as vomiting, diarrhoea and headache) was similar in both groups, as was the chance of a new infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In terms of lung function and flare-up of infection, we were unsure whether a higher dose of azithromycin is better than a lower dose (but only one study in children examined dose), or whether inhaled azithromycin is better than oral azithromycin. Taking oral azithromycin once a week compared to every day probably leads to less of an improvement in lung function, but there is probably a longer time to a flare-up in the weekly group. We were unable to combine all the study results because they were measured in different ways and at different time points; future trials should address this issue. Also, now that many people with CF are being treated with the new modulator therapies (e.g. elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor), it is important to assess how macrolide antibiotics affect the health of these people. In the studies we found for this review, none of the people taking part were being treated with modulator therapies.
We are able to report the results of the studies that compared azithromycin to placebo with certainty as the studies were well conducted and included a larger number of participants. The evidence from the studies comparing high and low doses or nebulised and oral azithromycin was much less certain because the studies were small and there was risk of bias in the way they were carried out. We were moderately certain of the results of the study comparing weekly azithromycin to daily azithromycin. The studies we have reported are the most up to date we could find. We last searched for studies in November 2022.
This review draws together up-to-date evidence from 70 studies including a total of 4761 people. There is continued support for the efficacy of individual TFCBT, EMDR, non-TFCBT and group TFCBT in the treatment of chronic PTSD in adults. Other non-trauma-focused psychological therapies did not reduce PTSD symptoms as significantly. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT are equally effective immediately post-treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non-TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. No specific conflicts of interest were identified. Although we included a substantial number of studies in this review, each only included small numbers of people and some were poorly designed. We assessed the overall quality of the studies as very low and so the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. There is insufficient evidence to show whether or not psychological therapy is harmful.
This review assessed the effectiveness of increasing fruit and vegetable consumption as a single intervention without the influence of other dietary patterns or other lifestyle modifications in healthy adults and those at high risk of CVD for the prevention of CVD. We found 10 trials involving 1730 participants in which six examined the provision of fruit and vegetables to increase intake and four trials examined dietary advice to increase fruit and vegetable intake. There were variations in the type of fruit and vegetable provided but all interventions investigating provision involved only one fruit or vegetable component. There were also variations in the number of fruit and vegetables that participants were advised to eat. Some studies advised participants to eat at least five servings of fruit and vegetables a day while others advised at least eight or nine servings per day. The duration of the interventions ranged from three months to one year. Adverse effects were reported in three of the included trials and included increased bowel movements, bad breath and body odour. None of the included trials were long enough to examine the effect of increased fruit and vegetable consumption on cardiovascular disease events such as heart attacks. There was no strong evidence that provision of one type of fruit or vegetable had beneficial effects on blood pressure and lipid levels but most trials were short term. There was some evidence to suggest beneficial effects of dietary advice to increase fruit and vegetable consumption but this is based on findings from two trials. More trials are needed to confirm these findings.
We found 13 studies to include in the review. There were 708 participants in total. All had dementia and were living in care homes. The most commonly used aromatherapy fragrance was lavender. Studies also used lemon balm, orange and cedar extracts. Ten studies assessed agitation, but five did not report data we could use or our confidence in their results was very low. We had moderate or low confidence in the results of the other five: four reported no significant effect of aromatherapy and one reported a significant benefit. Eight studies assessed behavioural and mental health issues, but three did not report any usable data, or our confidence in the results was very low. Of the other five, for which our confidence was moderate or low, four reported a significant benefit from aromatherapy and one reported no significant effect. Side effects of treatment were either poorly reported or not reported at all. No more than three studies reported our secondary outcomes which were quality of life, cognition (thinking), mood, sleep, activities of daily living, and caregiver burden. We found no evidence that aromatherapy was helpful for any of these outcomes. Overall the quality of the evidence was poor. Many of the studies were poorly reported and some did not report any data we could use. Most studies were very small so that there was a lot of uncertainty about their results. Results of different studies did not agree with one another. We have found no convincing evidence that aromatherapy is beneficial for people with dementia although there are many limitations to the data reported by the studies so conclusions cannot be drawn with confidence. In order to determine whether aromatherapy is safe and effective at relieving symptoms of dementia, larger, well-designed studies with clearer reporting are needed.
We searched the medical literature until 24 February 2017. We included one study with 541 study participants that randomly assigned participants with localised tumours of the kidney that were thought to be cancerous. On average, participants were followed for 9.3 years. Participants who had only the tumour taken out appear to be more likely to die from any cause than participants that had the tumour and the whole kidney taken out. There appeared to be little to no difference in the time until the tumour comes back or in the risk of serious complications resulting in death. We did not find any evidence as to how the groups compared when it comes to the need for haemodialysis or how their quality of life compared. The quality of evidence was low. This means that we have limited confidence in the results and that the true effect of partial nephrectomy may be substantially different.
The review authors searched the medical literature up to August 2013 and identified four randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) containing 216 participants investigating different lens types. Lens materials studied were acrylic, silicone, heparin surface modified, and poly(methyl methacrylate). The trials included participants with different causes of uveitis, compared different lens types, and reported different outcomes. Due to these differences across trials, no meta-analysis (pooling of trial data) was performed. The largest trial (140 participants) was funded by a professional society. The other three trials did not report their funding sources. There is very limited evidence on which to determine the effects of different types of lens materials for people with uveitis. The results from the largest trial provide only preliminary evidence that acrylic lenses may perform better than silicone lenses in terms of improving vision and reducing the chances of post-surgical inflammation and complications. At this time, there is not enough data to conclude whether additional types of lenses are preferable to other types. Because the trials included small numbers of participants in each of the four lens-type groups, there is uncertainty in the results of the studies.
We wanted to find out the effects of early tracheostomy in very ill COVID-19 patients on:
• death from any cause;
• whether patients got better after treatment, measured by how long they spent on a ventilator;
• whether patients' condition worsened so that they developed unwanted effects, such as lung infections; and
• how long they stayed in the intensive care unit. We searched for studies that investigated the performance of early tracheostomy compared to late tracheostomy in hospitalized adults with COVID-19.
We compared and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 1 good-quality study with 150 people, and 24 lower-quality studies with 6372 people. Patients’ average age was 62 years. Studies took place around the world, mainly in high- and upper-middle-income countries. All studies compared early with late tracheostomy but defined early and late differently. Early tracheostomy was defined at 7, 10, 12, 14 and 21 days after the start of mechanical ventilation. We selected up to 10 days for early tracheostomy and after 10 days as late. This was the time used by the good-quality study and in 6 of the other studies. We found the following results from 1 study with 150 people. early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference to deaths from any cause. Of 1000 people, 67 fewer die when a tracheostomy is performed early. Early tracheostomy may result in little to no effect on how long patients spend on a ventilator. Early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in the number of patients:
• with any unwanted effect; or
• with ventilator-related lung infections. Early tracheostomy may result in little benefit to no difference in the length of time patients spend in the intensive care unit. Our confidence in the evidence is very limited, because we found only 1 good-quality study with few participants. The other, less robust studies, performed tracheostomies at very different time points and measured and reported their results inconsistently. The evidence is up-to-date to 14 June 2022.
We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of diclofenac compared to other treatments, as well as the most effective way to deliver diclofenac to children. We searched for studies that compared (a) diclofenac to other treatments for postoperative pain; or (b) different ways of delivering diclofenac to children. We summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size. We found 32 studies that included 2250 children with postoperative pain. The largest study included 183 children and the smallest, 31 children. The studies were conducted in many countries around the world; the most common location was the United Kingdom (10 studies). The average age of the children was between 2 and 14 years. Diclofenac was used to manage postoperative pain in 12 different types of surgery; most commonly, ear, nose, and throat surgery (9 studies) or eye surgery (6 studies). It is unclear if diclofenac given before, during, or after surgery has an effect on pain relief, pain intensity, or minor and serious harms compared to a placebo (a 'dummy' or sham treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks or tastes identical to the medicine being tested).
It is unclear if diclofenac given before, during, or after surgery has an effect on pain relief or pain intensity compared to other medicines, such as opioids, paracetamol, or bupivacaine. Diclofenac probably results in less nausea and vomiting compared to opioids (7 studies involving 463 children), but probably increases the risk of any bleeding (2 studies involving 222 children), but we are very unsure about serious harms (death, long-term disability, or hospitalisation).
It is thus unclear if diclofenac given before, during, or after surgery has an effect on pain relief, pain intensity, or minor or serious harms compared to placebo or other medicines other than opioids. It is also unclear which route (by mouth or rectal delivery) is the most effective way to manage pain after surgery in children. We are not confident in the evidence because of study design limitations, and none of the studies measured some of our main outcomes of interest. There were also not enough large studies to be certain about the results. The evidence is current to April 2022.
We searched our own specialised register of controlled trials. We also contacted Sanofi Aventis, the manufacturers of rimonabant, and researchers who presented early findings at conferences. We found two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rimonabant for smoking cessation, covering 1567 smokers, and one RCT of rimonabant for relapse prevention covering 1661 quitters. The available information shows that rimonabant at the 20 mg dose increased by 1½-fold the chances of not smoking at one year, compared with placebo. Rimonabant 5 mg did no better than placebo at any time point. In the relapse prevention trial, smokers who quit successfully with rimonabant 20 mg were 1½ times more likely to remain abstinent on active treatment (5 mg or 20 mg for 42 weeks) than on placebo. For those who quit successfully on 5 mg, neither active nor placebo treatment appeared to benefit them in avoiding relapse. This inconsistent picture makes it difficult to find a clear benefit for rimonabant in preventing relapse. One trial of taranabant (317 smokers) did not find a benefit for treatment over placebo, and the taranabant group suffered more side effects than the placebo group. Main side effects for rimonabant included nausea and upper respiratory tract infections, and serious harms were reported to be low. For taranabant, the main side effects included problems with digestive, nervous, psychiatric, skin and blood vessel organ systems. For both drugs, the number and severity of the side effects increased in those taking higher doses. Although the evidence on weight change is sparse in these trials, weight gain was reported to be significantly lower among the rimonabant 20 mg quitters than in the 5 mg or placebo quitters. During treatment, overweight or obese smokers tended to lose weight on 20 mg, while normal weight smokers did not. Taranabant also limited weight gain during cessation attempts. In 2008 both rimonabant and taranabant were withdrawn by the manufacturers, because of links to mental disorders and unacceptable side effects.
We identified a total of three trials including 295 participants, of whom 148 were randomly chosen to receive primary closure and the remaining patients had T-tube drainage after laparoscopic exploration of common bile duct. All three trials were at high risk of bias (risk of underestimating or overestimating the benefits and harms of the intervention). There were no deaths in either group. There was no significant difference in the serious complication rate (approximately 97 complications per 1000 patients in the T-tube group versus 61 complications per 1000 participants in the primary closure group) or in the proportion of participants who developed serious complications (11.3% in the T-tube group versus 6.2% in the primary closure group). Although the complication rates in the T-tube group appear to be twice as high as those in the primary closure group, there is a possibility that this was not a true observation but rather a difference that occurred by chance (similar to there being one chance in eight of flipping a coin and having it come up heads or tails four times in a row). For this reason, we cannot be sufficiently confident scientifically that these differences were not just due to chance and that is the reason why we have stated that there was no 'significant' difference. Of course, if such a difference truly exists, it would be clinically important. None of the trials reported the quality of life of the participants. The average operating time was significantly longer in the T-tube group than in the primary closure group (by about 20 minutes). The average hospital stay was significantly longer in the T-tube group than in the primary closure group (by about three days). Participants returned to work significantly later in the T-tube group than primary closure group (by about eight days). Use of T-tube appears to increase the cost without providing any benefit to the patients. Further randomised trials with low risk of bias (low chance of arriving at wrong conclusions because of prejudice by healthcare providers, researchers, or patients) with longer follow-up period are necessary. Until the results from such trials are available, we discourage the routine use of T-tube after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration.
In this review, we have compared stage-based programmes of smoking cessation with standard (unstaged) programmes, or with 'usual care', or with assessment only. We found 41 stage-based trials, covering more than 33,000 smokers, which measured quit rates at least six months after treatment. Only four of the 41 trials directly compared the same intervention in a standard and a stage-based version. This showed that the stage-based version was neither more nor less effective than the standard one. Eighteen trials which compared stage-based self-help programmes with any control condition showed better success rates for the intervention groups. Thirteen trials of stage-based individual counselling versus any control condition showed a similar benefit for the intervention groups. These findings confirm the known effectiveness of these interventions, whether staged or unstaged. The evidence was less clear on the effects of stage-based telephone counselling, interactive computer programmes or training of doctors and helpers. This uncertainty may be due in part to smaller numbers of trials. We find on the evidence from this review that providing self-help or counselling support to smokers trying to quit is more effective than 'usual care' or simple observation. However, the extra value of fitting that support to the smoker's stage of change is currently unclear.
There was little evidence on the effectiveness and safety of most non-opioid drugs. However, evidence from single trials or at most two trials, suggests that some non-opioid drugs may work in providing pain relief. Non-opioid drugs were found to offer better pain relief (sedatives: one trial, 50 women), better satisfaction with pain relief (sedatives and antihistamines: two trials, 204 women; one trial, 223 women respectively) and better satisfaction with the childbirth experience (sedatives: one trial, 40 women) when compared with placebo. Women taking non-opioid drugs (NSAIDs or antihistamines) were less likely to be satisfied with pain relief when compared with women receiving opioids (one trial, 76 women; one trial 223 women). Women having the antihistamine hydroxyzine were more satisfied with their pain relief than those taking the antihistamine promethazine (one trial, 289 women) and women having sedatives were more satisfied with their pain relief than those having antihistamines. There were little data and no evidence of a significant difference for any of the comparisons of non-opioids for safety outcomes.
The majority of studies were conducted over 30 years ago and the quality of all studies was questionable. No study used paracetamol.
We wanted to find out which out of these possible treatments was most effective. We found only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that assessed nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) which helps in breaking down the mucous and has been shown to be useful in aiding airway clearance in cystic fibrosis compared to placebo (no active treatment) in children with both tracheomalacia and a concurrent respiratory infection. This trial showed no evidence of benefit in terms of the number of children who were cough-free two weeks after treatment. Also, there was less coughing reported, both during the day and at night, in the group who did not receive the intervention - however these differences were not statistically significant.
With the lack of evidence, the routine use of any therapies for intrinsic tracheomalacia cannot be recommended given the cost of nebulised rhDNase and the likely harmful effect. The decision to subject a child to any surgical or medical based therapies will have to be made on an individual basis, with careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio for each individual situation.
It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life-threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia. For those with less severe disease, RCTs on interventions such as antibiotics and chest physiotherapy are needed.
We searched medical databases to March 2019 for studies comparing ultrasound measurements to birth weight differences and we identified 39 studies. Twenty-two studies provided data on birth weight differences of 20% and 18 studies provided data on birth weight differences of 25%. We assessed the quality of individual studies using a tool called "Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies" (QUADAS-2) and the overall quality by a recommended method called GRADE to find out the reliability of the evidence. We found that ultrasound estimation of fetal weight differences compared to birth weight differences was not reliable. On average, ultrasound detected birth weight differences of 20% and 25% only half the time. The quality of evidence was very low.
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ultrasound as the sole measure for detecting birth weight differences in twins, or poor outcomes. The diagnostic accuracy of other measures including amniotic fluid volume (the fluid surrounding the babies in the womb) or Doppler studies (which use sound waves to detect the movement of blood in the babies' blood vessels and the umbilical cord) in combination with ultrasound to inform clinical decisions needs to be evaluated. Future well-designed studies could also research the impact of whether the babies share a placenta (or not), the sex of the babies, and gestational age (time from woman's last menstrual period), in the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for estimated birth weight differences.
This review included five studies with a combined total of 1508 participants. The combined data showed no statistically significant difference in recurrent VTE between the once daily and twice daily treatment regimens. A comparison of major bleeding events, improvement of the blood clot size and death also showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatment regimens. None of the five included studies reported information on post-thrombotic syndrome (ongoing swelling of the affected leg, pain, and skin changes). One daily injection with LMWH is therefore as effective and safe as twice daily injections.
The review of studies including 15 trials and 1422 children found that there were some encouraging results in short term studies when nedocromil was compared on its own with placebo, particularly with regard to lung function tests. However, these results were not confirmed in one large, longer term study of four to six years duration, which did not show significant difference in the primary outcome of symptom free days. This study was conducted in children who had mild asthma. There may be a role for nedocromil in the management of moderate asthma, but it should be assessed in relation to inhaled steroids, whose efficacy is well-established. This particularly important in symptomatic asthma.
We wanted to know if maintenance therapy following previous treatment is effective in controlling disease for adults with CLL and if it causes any adverse effects. We searched for studies that compared maintenance therapy with placebo (dummy treatment) or observation, or head-to-head comparisons of maintenance therapies. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We identified 11 studies (2393 participants) for inclusion in the review. All studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are the most reliable clinical studies as they randomly allocate people to receive treatment (intervention group) or no treatment (control group). We synthesised the evidence from 10 studies (2341 participants) to assess the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy for CLL when compared with control groups receiving observation or placebo (dummy treatment).
Compared to observation, anti-CD20 mAbs probably have little to no effect on overall survival (evidence from 3 studies with 1152 participants), but probably increase the time in which the disease is controlled (progression-free survival) (evidence from 5 studies with 1255 participants).
Compared to placebo/observation, IMiD probably has little to no effect on overall survival (evidence from 3 studies with 461 participants), but probably results in a large increase in progression-free survival (evidence from 3 studies with 461 participants).
Compared to observation, anti-CD20 mAbs may result in increased serious side effects (evidence from 5 studies with 1284 participants), but may not affect the chance of dying from treatment (evidence from 4 studies with 1189 participants). Anti-CD20 mAbs may slightly reduce the number of people who stopped treatment (evidence from 6 studies with 1321 participants), but may slightly increase the overall number of side effects (evidence from 6 studies with 1321 participants).
Compared to placebo/observation, IMiD may result in increased serious side effects (evidence from 2 studies with 400 participants), and may slightly increase the number of people who died due to maintenance treatment (evidence from 3 studies with 458 participants). The evidence for the effect of IMiD on number of people who stopped treatment is very uncertain (evidence from 2 studies with 400 participants), but IMiD probably increases the overall number of side effects (evidence from 3 studies with 458 participants).
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether anti-CD20 mAbs maintenance therapy affected health-related quality of life, and our confidence in the evidence is low (evidence from 1 study with 480 participants).
No studies evaluated other new maintenance interventions, such as B-cell receptor inhibitors, B-cell leukaemia-2/lymphoma-2 inhibitors, or obinutuzumab. The overall certainty (confidence) of the evidence was mostly moderate to low due to issues within the trials such as the potential for bias, differences in baseline characteristics, and imprecise estimates of intervention effects. The evidence is current as of January 2022.
Four high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 585 patients) comparing TENS with placebo for chronic low-back pain were included in this study.  Due to conflicting evidence, it is unclear if TENS is beneficial in reducing back pain intensity.  However, there was consistent evidence in two trials (410 patients) that TENS did not improve the level of disability due to back pain. There was moderate evidence that use of medical services and work status (e.g. loss of work, sick days) did not change during treatment. Finally, there did not seem to be a difference between conventional and acupuncture-like TENS.
Some adverse effects were reported, typically minor skin irritations observed equally in the treatment and placebo groups. However, there was one participant who developed a severe rash four days after the start of treatment.
In summary, the review authors found conflicting evidence regarding the benefits of TENS for chronic LBP, which does not support the use of TENS in the routine management of chronic LBP.
This review included randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people were randomly assigned into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared the use of saline and heparin to prevent blockage, and other complications related to long-term catheters. The evidence is current to 9 April 2019. Two review authors independently reviewed the studies. We included four studies with a total of 255 participants in the review. The four trials were all undertaken in large teaching (tertiary) hospitals, and directly compared the use of saline and heparin. The studies were, however, very different in the way they compared saline and heparin, with different concentrations of heparin and different frequencies of flushes reported. We were able to combine the results of two studies: the analysis showed imprecise results for the blocking of catheters and blood stream infections for normal saline versus heparin. One study reported the duration of catheter placement to be similar between the two study arms. The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. There was high risk of bias for blinding, there were differences between the studies methods and interventions, inconsistent results between the studies, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest. We found there was not enough evidence to determine which solution, saline or heparin, is more effective for reducing complications. Further research is required and is likely to have an important impact in this area. This review is an update of a review first published in 2015.
In October 2016, we searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture. We identified eight additional trials that were eligible for the review since the last version of the review in 2013. In total, we found 22 trials which reported on 3456 pregnant women. The authors rated most of the trials as having moderate risk of bias.
Moderate to high-quality evidence found that acupuncture and acupressure did not reduce caesarean sections.
Acupuncture may promote a more favourable state of the cervix within 24 hours in the two trials (192 women) that looked at this. Only one trial reported on serious outcomes for the mother or her baby, finding no serious incidents in either the acupuncture or the control group (low-quality evidence). Acupuncture and acupressure do not appear to reduce the need for caesarean section but may increase the readiness of the cervix for labour. Acupressure did not help in any of the outcomes we examined in this review. The trials varied in the delivery of acupuncture and acupressure, the comparison groups, and the outcomes looked at. These variations mean that we have to be careful in how we interpret the findings. More studies are needed to determine if acupuncture or acupressure increases the number of women who experience vaginal deliveries within 24 hours and to examine the safety of acupuncture and acupressure.
Nine studies were included, with a total of 213 people. The average age of participants ranged from 45 to 74 years. Treatment duration ranged from a single session to up to four weeks of treatment. Eight studies examined people who were stable and one study examined people who were experiencing an exacerbation (flare-up) of bronchiectasis. PEP therapy was compared to a range of ACTs. Two small studies indicated that PEP therapy is as effective as other ACTs at improving quality of life. The duration of hospitalisation when using PEP therapy or other ACTs during a flare-up was similar. Both PEP therapy and other techniques appear to have a similar effect on the clearance of mucus from the lungs and on lung function. Similiar levels of breathlessness were experienced with PEP therapy and other ACTs. Other outcomes of interest were the rate of hospitalisation but these have not yet been reported. On the basis of this information, the prescription of PEP therapy for people with bronchiectasis is as suitable as any other type of ACT, with no greater advantage of PEP therapy. Because of inadequate reporting of methods and small number of participants, the quality of evidence was low.
This Cochrane plain language summary is current to May 2017.
 the reviewers searched four digital databases to find all relevant studies on this topic. The evidence is current to 29 January 2018. In total, they retrieved 37 relevant studies. One previously included study was recently retracted and subsequently excluded from this review. All studies included adults undergoing surgery. A total of 26 studies (4603 participants) had assessed the occurrence of infection after surgery, nine studies (1072 participants) had investigated delayed wound healing, and 10 studies (595 participants) had looked at the effect of dexamethasone on blood sugar. after pooling results, reviewers found that dexamethasone had no effect on the development of an infection after surgery, and that wounds healed equally well in both groups. However, the quality of the studies was moderate to low, which means that more studies are needed to support a definitive conclusion. Finally, the mean blood sugar of patients without diabetes receiving dexamethasone was slightly higher than that of patients not receiving dexamethasone (low-quality evidence). In patients with diabetes, this effect seemed to be larger. However, blood sugar was measured in only 74 patients with diabetes, which means that reviewers did not obtain a very accurate estimate. They qualified this as very low-quality evidence. dexamethasone probably does not increase the risk of infection after surgery. Not enough information is available to determine whether dexamethasone has an effect on the time it takes for surgical wounds to heal. However, included studies did not focus on patients with high risk for delayed wound healing, for example, patients with diabetes or those taking steroids; thus more studies are needed on this topic. Additionally, one has to keep in mind that taking dexamethasone leads to a mild increase in blood sugar. For patients with diabetes, very limited evidence suggests a greater increase in blood sugar. Whether or not the small increase in blood sugar has any effect on healing of surgical wounds has yet to be established. The two studies awaiting classification and three ongoing trials may alter the conclusions of this review, once assessed.
This review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants. Most of these were of poor methodological quality.
For treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB-UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs. In one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearance rate was in favour of oral PUVA. The evidence from the comparison of NB-UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left-right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA.
Two RCTs found NB-UVB plus retinoid (re-NB-UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re-PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis. One RCT found no significant differences between NB-UVB and selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side-effects.
In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB-UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate.
In summary, NB-UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use. NB-UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP. Evidence regarding NB-UVB and conventional BB-UVB is limited. The long-term safety of NB-UVB needs to be confirmed. The efficacy of NB-UVB for clearing PPP needs to be confirmed in future studies.
The evidence was current up to 13 February 2013. We found six relevant studies, five of which were large observational studies from the US with a comparison group and with study durations from two to 11 years, and one was a much smaller 12 week study from Haiti. There were over 1.5 million participants in the studies. Information for these studies was taken from American insurance databases (Medicare) and from hospital records. The small study was based on emergency medical care after the 2008 hurricanes in Haiti. Most studies stated that there was no difference in the number of people who died when given anaesthetic by either a nurse anaesthetist or a medically qualified anaesthetist. One study stated that there was a lower rate of death for nurse anaesthetists compared to medically qualified anaesthetists. One study stated that the risk of death was lower for nurse anaesthetists compared to those being supervised by an anaesthetist or working within an anaesthetic team, whilst another stated the risk of death was higher compared to a supervised or team approach. Other studies gave varied results. Similarly, there were variations between studies for the rates of complications for patients depending on their anaesthetic provider. Much of the data came from large databases, which may have contained inaccuracies in reporting. There may also be important differences between patients that might account for variation in study results, for example, whether patients who were more ill were treated by a medically qualified anaesthetist, or whether nurse anaesthetists worked in hospitals that had fewer resources. Several of the studies had allowed for these potential differences in their analysis, however it was unclear to us whether this had been done sufficiently well to allow us to be confident about the results. There was also potential confounding from the funding sources for some of these studies. As none of the data were of sufficiently high quality and the studies presented inconsistent findings, we concluded that it was not possible to say whether there were any differences in care between medically qualified anaesthetists and nurse anaesthetists from the available evidence.
Thirteen trials involving 2197 participants were included in this review. We found that several antibiotic treatments were equally effective in eliminating the bacteria infecting patients, but they did not alter the clinical outcome. There was insufficient evidence to decide whether there is benefit for treating healthy contacts. Side effects were reported with antibiotics and they varied from one antibiotic to another. The result of the review should be interpreted with caution since this review is based on a limited number of trials and some of these trials involved small numbers of participants.
Nineteen studies involving 10,400 people were included in this review. The studies lasted between 4 and 156 weeks. All of the people included in the studies had COPD of different severity. Both men and women were included, and most of the studies included only adults aged 45 or older.
All studies compared a combined inhaler with a placebo that was identical in appearance to the combined inhaler, so the people in the trials did not know whether they were taking the drug or the dummy inhaler. Some of the studies included two groups treated with the combined inhaler; one group was getting a higher dose and one group was getting a lower dose.
The evidence presented here is current to June 2013.
Most of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. We found that people receiving a combined inhaler were less likely to have a flare-up (‘exacerbation’) of their COPD. The chance of having an exacerbation was reduced by about one quarter.
A small reduction in the risk of death was seen over three years, although most of the evidence about death comes from one large, long trial called TORCH. According to TORCH, approximately 42 people would need to be treated with a combined inhaler for three years to prevent one death.
We also found that people receiving combined inhalers had small improvements in quality of life, symptoms related to COPD and their breathing tests. However, these improvements may not have been very noticeable to them.
People treated with combined inhalers were more likely to have a lung infection called pneumonia. Again, most of the evidence about pneumonia comes from the TORCH trial. According to TORCH, when compared with placebo, for approximately every 17 people treated with combined inhaler, one extra person would get pneumonia.
People treated with combined inhalers were no more or less likely to experience serious unwanted events, including side effects, during treatment.
No consistent differences were found between the three different types of inhalers included in this review.
However, it is important to note that we cannot tell from this review whether it is the combination that is important or whether one of the two drugs in the combined inhaler may have had the real impact. The evidence presented in this review is generally considered to be of moderate quality. Most of the studies did not clearly explain how they decided which people would receive the combined inhaler and which would receive placebo, and this is an important part of a well-conducted study. Also, more people receiving placebo dropped out of the trials than those receiving a combined inhaler. This often happened because of exacerbations of COPD. This means that by the end of the trial, the groups might have been unbalanced, and this could affect the accuracy of the results.
In this systematic review of non-randomised studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for CD over vaginal delivery (VD) in the prevention of anal incontinence. This review encompasses 21 published studies, involving 31,698 women, delivered by 6,028 CD and by 25,170 VD. No randomised studies comparing CD to VD in average risk pregnancies exist. The above conclusion is therefore based upon less than optimal evidence.
We found a total of 16 studies. They included mostly men, older than 60 years of age, with moderate, to severe urinary symptoms. Most studies were funded by the companies that make these drugs. Compared to placebo, phosphodiesterase inhibitors may make urinary symptoms a little better and reduce bother, but may also cause more unwanted drug effects.
There is probably no difference between phosphodiesterase inhibitors and alpha-blockers when it comes to improving urinary symptoms, and there may be no difference with regards to how bothersome symptoms are, or unwanted drug effects.
Taking a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with an alpha-blocker may improve urinary symptoms slightly more than taking alpha-blockers alone. We found no evidence regarding urinary bother. However, combination treatment probably causes a lot more unwanted drug effects.
Taking a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with an alpha-blocker may improve urinary symptoms slightly more than taking a phosphodiesterase inhibitor alone. We found no evidence regarding bother or unwanted drug effects.
In the short term (up to 12 weeks), the combination of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor probably makes urinary symptoms a little better compared to taking a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor alone, but the effect may be too small to notice. We found no evidence on bother, nor on rates of unwanted drug effects. When taken longer (13 to 26 weeks), combination treatment probably also improves urinary symptoms slightly to a degree that may not be noticeable. We found no evidence regarding urinary bother. Unwanted drug effects may be similar.
We found no evidence for other combination treatments or comparing different phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Most studies investigated only short-term use of these drugs (up to 12 weeks); therefore, long-term effects are largely unknown. We mostly rated the quality of evidence as moderate or low, meaning that we are somewhat or quite unsure of the true results. The real effects may be similar or quite different.
We wanted to find out if hospital at home makes a difference to patient health outcomes and to living independently at home. We also wanted to find out if it was less expensive than hospital care, and if it affects length of stay in treatment and patient satisfaction. We searched for studies that compared hospital at home treatment for an acute health event with inpatient hospital care. We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 20 studies, of which four were identified for this update, with a total of 3100 patients with a range of acute conditions. Four studies recruited participants with chronic obstructive (lung) disease; two studies recruited participants recovering from a stroke; seven studies recruited participants with a (sudden or short-term) medical condition who were mainly older; and the remaining studies recruited participants with a mix of conditions.
When compared to in-hospital care, admission avoidance hospital at home services for a select group of patients probably make little or no difference to risk of death or to the likelihood of being taken to hospital in the next 3 to 12 months, and probably increase the chances of living at home at six months' follow-up. Patients who receive care at home may have increased satisfaction compared to those in hospital; however, the effects of this type of care on the caregivers who support them are unclear. Hospital at home probably results in little to no difference in patients' health status. Hospital at home decreases the amount of time patients spend in hospital, while length of stay in hospital at home tended to be longer than a typical hospital stay. Admission avoidance hospital at home probably decreases treatment costs, though by a range of different amounts. Due to the small size of most of the studies, we are moderately confident that admission avoidance hospital at home does not make a difference to the number of people who died when compared to in-hospital care. Our confidence in the evidence for readmission and living in residential care was reduced to moderate because the lengths of follow-up differed among studies. We are moderately confident in the evidence for patient-reported health status, as participants were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. We have little confidence in the evidence on patient satisfaction because not many studies reported this outcome, and on length of stay because length of stay varied across studies. We are moderately confident in the evidence for cost because only three trials looked at this fully. We searched for studies published up to February 2022.
We searched online databases and registries for relevant studies on 10 June 2022. We found 13 trials with 699 participants. Of these, 55% were female and the average age of study participants ranged from 47 years to 59 years. The average duration of low back pain amongst study participants varied from 5 to 12 years. Ten of the 13 studies had financial ties to manufacturers of spinal cord stimulation systems. No studies have tested whether spinal cord stimulation surgery is better than placebo (sham or 'dummy' treatment) in people followed up for longer than 6 months. This means that the benefits of the treatment in the long term are unknown. Most of the available studies only measured outcomes at less than 1 month after treatment, and only 1 study measured outcomes at 6 months after treatment:
Pain intensity (0 to 100, lower scores mean less pain)
At 6 months, the only available study found no benefit of spinal cord stimulation on back pain compared with placebo (1 trial, 50 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). At 6 months, participants given placebo treatment reported that their average pain was 61 points, and those given spinal cord stimulation reported that their pain was 4 points better (8.2 points better to 0.2 points worse).
Function (0 to 100, lower scores mean better function)
At 6 months, one study found no benefit of spinal cord stimulation on function (that is, people's general physical function) compared with placebo (1 trial, 50 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Participants given placebo treatment reported that their functioning was 35.4 points at 6 months, and those given spinal cord stimulation reported that their functioning was 1.3 points better (3.9 points better to 1.3 points worse).
Health-related quality of life (0 to 1, higher scores mean better quality of life)
At 6 months, one study found no benefit from spinal cord stimulation on health-related quality of life compared with placebo (1 trial, 50 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Participants given placebo treatment reported that their health-related quality of life was 0.44 points at 6 months, and those given spinal cord stimulation reported that their health-related quality of life was 0.04 points better (0.16 points better to 0.08 points worse).
Global assessment of efficacy (number of participants with a 50% improvement in pain or better)
None of the placebo-controlled studies measured this outcome.
Withdrawals due to adverse events (i.e. an unwanted event that causes harm)
We are uncertain whether spinal cord stimulation caused people to withdraw from studies due to adverse events because there were few studies and the evidence was based on only a few cases.
Adverse events (e.g. increased pain)
One study that followed people for 12 months found 9 participants (18%) experienced adverse events such as infections, damage to the spine or nerves, bladder problems, and movement of very small parts of the devices that deliver the electrical impulses to the spinal cord (known as 'lead migration').
Serious adverse events (e.g. an infection requiring hospitalisation)
Some studies reported serious adverse events in people receiving spinal cord stimulation that required repeated surgery. The only placebo-controlled study that followed people for 12 months found 4 participants (8%) required repeated surgery. In the five other studies of people receiving a new spinal cord stimulation implant, the number of people requiring repeat surgery, due to adverse events such as infection or device problems, ranged from 4.1% at 8 weeks to 30.9% at 24 months. However, it was not possible to estimate how common these events were compared with placebo or no treatment, as limited information was available. For people with low back pain, we are moderately confident that, at 6 months, spinal cord stimulation probably does not lead to lower pain, better function, or higher quality of life compared with placebo. We are uncertain whether spinal cord stimulation can improve outcomes in the immediate term compared with placebo. Little to no information is available regarding long-term efficacy or the risk of side effects and complications.
We reviewed evidence from randomised trials that assessed an educational intervention given after presentation in the emergency setting by adults over 17 years old. Thirteen trials involving 2157 people were included. The studies suggested that following the intervention there was a reduction in the frequency of future hospital admissions; however, the effect on visit to the emergency department was imprecise and the results of our analysis indicate that this was a chance result. Education may be an effective reinforcement strategy in reducing future hospital admission following emergency department attendance, but there was little evidence to suggest that it improved other indicators of chronic disease severity such as lung function and quality of life.
That CJD and vCJD are very rare diseases creates challenges for researchers aiming to conduct rigorous quantitative studies in this area. Although we searched widely to identify all relevant research evaluating the effects of interventions to communicate with (notify and support) people at risk, we did not identify any studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this Cochrane review.
However, systematic searches did identify a number of pieces of relevant research and literature that provided evidence about policy implementation and consumer experiences in situations of iatrogenic exposure to risk. This research formed the basis of a thematic synthesis. The synthesis identified several activities that aim to improve the experiences of people at risk of CJD and vCJD. It indicates that communication may be best considered as a longitudinal multicomponent programme occurring over time, ensuring that notification is coordinated and considers impact; that support is in place and is offered over time; that communication is flexible, tailored and responsive to need; and that supporting activities, such as widespread education of the healthcare workforce, the public and the media, and monitoring of access to health care for those at risk, are in place. The thematic synthesis also indicates that poor communication practices may have negative impacts or cause harm, such as discrimination in accessing health care. In the absence of rigorous evaluative studies the results of this thematic synthesis can be used to inform policy and practice decisions for communicating with people at risk.
We identified and included four studies (317 babies in total) comparing the use of restricted versus standard fluid administration. We found no ongoing studies; however, one trial is awaiting classification. Evidence is current to December 6, 2019. The very limited available evidence cannot answer our review question. Only two small studies (172 babies) reported the duration of treatment with oxygen - the primary outcome of this review - and we are uncertain whether fluid restriction decreases or increases treatment duration. Three studies reported the incidence of the need for a breathing machine, and we are uncertain about any differences between restricted and standard fluid administration. The length of hospital stay was shorter by 22 hours for infants with fluid restriction; however, this was reported in only one trial (80 babies) of low methodological quality, and we are uncertain about this finding. The certainty of evidence was very low for all analyses because only a small number of studies have looked at this intervention, few babies were included in these studies, and all studies could have been better designed. Thus, we are uncertain whether fluid restriction improves the outcomes of babies with TTN.
We searched for relevant studies and identified 28 randomised controlled trials, involving over 4278 participants (search current to 20 July 2021). We looked at cosmetic appearance, complications, residual varicose vein rates, quality of life, and symptomatic improvement related to sclerotherapy. There were no trials assessing treatment versus no interventions, sclerotherapy at different time intervals, or sclerotherapy compared with pharmacological therapy.
Our results showed that, compared to placebo, sclerotherapy may improve cosmetic appearance and quality of life, and may reduce residual varicose veins and persistence of symptoms but the evidence is uncertain. Rates of deep vein thrombosis may be slightly increased but the evidence is uncertain. There were no data for recurrent varicose veins. There was not enough Information to conclude if one concentration of foam was better than another, or if foam was better than liquid or any other substance; or if there was any benefit of one injection technique compared to another. The evidence was graded as very low to moderate for all outcomes. The reliability of the evidence was downgraded due to concerns about how the studies were designed (risk of bias), the low number of studies providing information for each outcome, the low number of participants, clinical differences between the study participants, and wide confidence intervals. There is a need for more high-quality trials using standardised methods to increase our confidence in the results.
Many of these therapies have been tried in non-randomised studies, but we found only eight small randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 236 participants, that met our criteria for inclusion. Two trials with 22 and 11 participants (20 with antibodies against MAG) suggest that IVIg may sometimes produce short-term measurable benefit and is relatively safe, but the benefit is of doubtful clinical significance. No severe adverse effects related to IVIg were reported in these trials. A trial of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids showed some mild benefit. Two trials of rituximab demonstrated a positive benefit of rituximab, but this evidence was of low quality because of small numbers of participants and concerns about the design of one of the two studies. Reported adverse effects of rituximab were few, and mostly minor. Other trials did not allow us to draw conclusions about the efficacy of other agents and reported few serious adverse events. We need large, well-designed RCTs to assess the efficacy of the existing and new therapies, and better ways for doctors and researchers to detect changes that people report in response to treatments.
The evidence is up to date to February 2016.
In this analysis, we assessed the effect of CSFs on outcome after stroke using data from clinical trials of people with recent stroke. We included a total of 11 studies and 1275 participants. A higher death rate was observed in participants treated with erythropoietin (EPO) in three trials (782 participants); whether further trials of EPO will be performed early after stroke remains unclear. In eight small trials involving 548 participants, patterns of improvement after a stroke were observed using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and further trials are ongoing. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of CSFs in the treatment of people with recent stroke.
Nine studies, involving 8228 women, were included in this review. Most of the women in the studies (91%) had tumours 3 cm or less in size, all had complete removal of the tumour on pathology and 68% had no evidence of cancer in their lymph nodes. Where the breast size was known, 83% had small or medium breasts. The evidence is current up to May 2015. Local recurrence was not different for women having fewer treatments (four fewer local relapses per 1000 (where the true value may be anywhere between 16 fewer to 10 more local relapses per 1000)). Breast appearance was not different for women undergoing fewer treatments (31 fewer fair/poor breast appearance per 1000 (where the true value may be anywhere between 59 fewer to 3 more per 1000 with fair/poor breast appearance)). Survival was not altered by having fewer treatments (13 fewer deaths per 1000 (where the true value could be between 31 fewer to 5 more deaths per 1000)) and there was no significant difference in late skin toxicity (4 more episodes of toxicity per 1000; where the true value may be anywhere between 14 fewer to 36 more episodes of toxicity per 1000) or radiation toxicity. Acute skin toxicity is decreased with fewer treatments (326 fewer events per 1000 (where the true value may be anywhere between 264 fewer to 374 fewer acute skin toxicity events per 1000)). This review indicates that for women who fit these criteria, using fewer radiation treatments after tumour removal gives the same cancer control, with less skin reaction at the time and the likely the same side-effects in the long term. We found high quality evidence for the following outcomes: local recurrence-free survival, breast appearance, toxicity, overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival. We found moderate quality evidence for relapse-free survival, and no data for mastectomy rate (mastectomy may be required because of local recurrence or unacceptable treatment-related toxicity) or costs.
The aim of this review was to find out whether statins prevent death and complications from heart disease in people who have had a kidney transplant. We included 17 studies in 3282 adults with a functioning kidney transplant which compared statin therapy to a placebo or standard treatment. Based largely on information from a single, large and well-conducted study, statins may reduce complications from heart disease although information from the available research is imprecise. The effects of statin treatment on death overall, stroke, kidney function and side-effects are uncertain in people with a kidney transplant. Large additional studies of statin therapy may improve our confidence that statin treatment can safely prevent serious complications from heart disease for people who have a kidney transplant.
The objectives of this review was to assess the effects of HBC on morbidity and mortality in those with HIV/AIDS. A comprehensive search for clinical trials of HBC including all forms of treatment, care and support offered in the home was done. Eleven completed and two ongoing studies were identified. Studies were generally small and very few studies were done in developing countries. There was a lack of studies truly looking at the effect of home based care itself or looking at significant end points (death and progression to AIDS). Intensive home-based nursing significantly improved self-reported knowledge of HIV and medications, and self-reported adherence to medication. Another study, comparing proportion of participants with greater than 90% adherence, found statistically significant differences over time but no significant change in CD4 counts and viral loads. A third study found significant differences in HIV stigma, worry and physical functioning but no differences in depressive symptoms, mood, general health, and overall functioning. Comprehensive case management by trans-professional teams compared to usual care by primary care nurses had no significant difference in quality-of-life after 6-months of follow-up and average length of time on service. Home total parenteral nutrition had no significant impact on overall survival and rate of re-hospitalisation. Two trials comparing computers with brochures/nothing/standard medical care found no significant effect on health status, and decision-making confidence and skill, but a reduction in social isolation after controlling for depression. Two trials evaluating home exercise programmes found opposing results. Home-based safe water systems reduced diarrhea frequency and severity among persons with HIV in Africa.
We identified nine clinical trials for inclusion in this review by searching medical databases in November 2015. We found only low or very low quality evidence of prophylactic barbiturates in infants with perinatal asphyxia. The studies in this review included small numbers of babies and only a few studies looked at the health of infants over a long period of time. At present, there is not enough information to recommend giving barbiturate therapy to newborn babies soon after birth asphyxia but before seizures start. It is unclear whether giving barbiturates to newborn babies soon after birth asphyxia but before seizures start is safe or effective. More studies are needed.
The authors found seven eligible studies involving 571 people. The combined results suggest that HBOT reduces the risk of death and improves the level of coma; however, there is no evidence that these survivors have an improved outcome in terms of quality of life. It is possible, therefore, that the overall effect of hyperbaric oxygen is to make it more likely that people will survive with severe disability after such injuries. The authors conclude that the routine use of HBOT in brain-injured patients cannot be justified by the findings of this review.
Due to the small number of trials with a limited number of people, it is not possible to be confident in the findings. Further large, high quality trials are required to define the true extent of benefit from HBOT.
However studies have focused on heart protection rather than residual kidney function. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of ACEis and ARBs therapy for preserving residual kidney function in PD patients. Six studies (257 patients) were included (three ARB studies, one ACEi study and ACEi versus ARB studies). Long-term use (12 months or more) of an ARB showed a significant benefit in preserving residual kidney function in continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients compared with other antihypertensive drugs, although there was no significant benefit when an ARB were used for less than six months). One study showed that compared with other antihypertensive drugs, long-term use of the ACEi ramipril showed a significant reduction in the decline of residual kidney function in patients on CAPD as well as anuria rate. While dizziness and cough are the main adverse events when an ACEi is used, only one study comparing an ARB with an ACEi reported this outcome and no significant difference between the two groups were found. While the use of an ARB or an ACEi may both be useful in preserving residual kidney function, the small number of studies and small number of patients enrolled means there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of an ACEi or an ARB as first line antihypertensive therapy in PD patients.
The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness and side effects of biofeedback therapy used for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults who are unable to relax the muscles which control bowel movements. This review identified 17 eligible studies that included a total of 931 participants. The studies either compared the effectiveness of different types of biofeedback to one another, or biofeedback to a sham biofeedback (a fake biofeedback treatment) or biofeedback to standard treatment consisting of diet, exercise and laxatives. There is some evidence that biofeedback is superior to treatment with oral diazepam (a sedative known as Valium), sham biofeedback and laxatives. One study of 60 participants found biofeedback with computer equipment to be superior to oral diazepam (a sedative drug that is not usually used to treat constipation). Another study of 77 participants suggests that biofeedback is superior to sham biofeedback or standard therapy consisting of diet, exercise and laxatives. Another study with 109 participants also suggested that biofeedback with computer equipment is superior to conventional treatment with laxatives and dietary and lifestyle advice. Some surgical procedures (partial division of puborectalis and stapled transanal rectal resection) were reported to be superior to biofeedback. However, there was a high risk of side effects in the surgical treatment groups including wound infection, faecal incontinence, pain, and bleeding that required further surgery. One other study of 60 participants did not find a difference in effectiveness between surgery (posterior myomectomy of internal anal sphincter and puborectalis) and biofeedback treatment. Botulinum toxin-A injection may have short term benefits over biofeedback, but the benefit does not last. No adverse events were reported for biofeedback, although this was not specifically reported in the majority of studies. The results of this review need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on small numbers of patients and the overall quality of the evidence from the studies was rated as low or very low due to lack of precision of the results and the low methodological quality of the studies. Thus no firm conclusions can be made regarding the effectiveness and potential side effects of biofeedback treatment for patients with chronic constipation who are unable to relax the muscles which control bowel movements. Further larger trials are needed to provide better evidence.
We assessed that the risk of bias within the individual trials was low, or we did not have enough information to decide. Five of the eight studies were sponsored by the drug companies that produce zonisamide. We rated the certainty of the evidence for the main outcomes as moderate. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. More research is needed that concentrates on examining the response of different doses of zonisamide.
The evidence is current to September 2019.
We found 23 trials (involving a total of 1339 children and adults using intermittent catheterisation for bladder emptying) comparing different catheterisation techniques and catheter designs.  We are uncertain if there is any difference between aseptic and clean techniques in the risk of symptomatic UTI. We identified no data relating to the risk of adverse events. We are uncertain if there is any difference between single-use and multiple-use catheters in the risk of symptomatic UTI because the certainty of evidence is low. One study comparing these interventions reported zero adverse events in either group and no other adverse event data were reported. We are uncertain if there is any difference between hydrophilic and uncoated catheters in the number of people with symptomatic UTI. Uncoated catheters probably slightly reduce the risk of urethral trauma and bleeding compared to hydrophilic-coated catheters. We are uncertain if there is any difference in patient satisfaction or preference. We are uncertain if there is any difference between one catheter length versus another catheter length for all included outcomes.
We identified no useable evidence relating to cost-effectiveness for any of the comparisons. The current research evidence is uncertain and design and reporting issues are significant. There are many factors that could limit the generalisability of findings, for example, the study setting (e.g. hospital or home), sex of participants, variability in adherence to user instructions and whether catheterisation is undertaken by the user or another person. More well-designed trials are needed. Such trials should include analysis of cost-effectiveness because there are likely to be substantial differences associated with the use of different catheter designs, catheterisation techniques and strategies.
We found nine studies that involved 579 patients; two studies looked at performing exercise before the AVF was created, and seven studies looked at performing exercise after the creation of the AVF. Unfortunately, only the seven studies performing exercises after the creation of the AVF could be analysed. The types of exercise programs used were isotonic (exercises which put a constant amount of weight on your muscles while moving your joints) and isometric (contraction of the muscles without any movement in the surrounding joints).
Isotonic exercise may improve ultrasound maturation compared to no intervention, while isometric training may improve both ultrasound and clinical maturation compared to isotonic exercise. Isometric exercise may also increase vein size and artery blood flow compared to isotonic exercise. None of the included studies reported adverse events.
There was low confidence in the information about the effects of interventions as the studies were small and the types of interventions varied. Our findings suggest that the current research evidence examining upper limb exercise programs is of low quality, attributable to variability in the type of interventions used and the overall low number of participants.
This review identified one small randomised controlled trials, involving 42 women. There were no significant differences in outcomes for mother or baby when pre-term birth at 36 weeks was planned, compared with later birth. However, it was such a small trial that it does not rule out important benefits or harms from early birth. There was also small overall difference in gestational age at birth between the two groups in the trial, possibly because of the high rate of spontaneous preterm birth with this condition. Further trials are needed.
This review found that giving dexamethasone (a corticosteroid drug) around the time of extubation can help prevent swelling in the baby's throat that might require reinsertion of the tube. However, the review found that there are adverse effects of dexamethasone. The benefits only outweigh the risks for babies at high risk of complication (such as those who have received several, or prolonged, intubations).
This review compared the therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicines with other pharmaceutical agents. Among the 44 included randomised trials involving 5100 participants, all from China, no trial used placebo or bed rest as a control intervention. Twenty trials used a common prescription of Shou Tai Pill as a basic formula, while the other 24 trials used other formulae. The Western medicines included tocolytic drugs such as salbutamol and magnesium sulfate, hormonal supplementation with human chorionic gonadotrophin or progesterone and supportive supplements including vitamin E and folic acid. Five trials followed 550 women until after 28 weeks of gestation and delivery and showed that combined Chinese herbal and Western medicines were more effective than Western medicines alone in the treatment of threatened miscarriage. The remaining studies looked at the immediate effects of treatment. Combined treatment was more effective than Western medicines in preventing inevitable miscarriage so that the pregnancy continued. Many of the trials did not report on side effects during treatment or throughout continuing pregnancy and birth. Chinese medicine practitioners slightly modify the classical prescriptions depending on the individual women’s clinical presentations. All the trials had poor methodological quality. In conclusion, there is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of threatened miscarriage and to determine if Chinese herbal medicines alone are more beneficial than Western medicines alone for threatened miscarriage.
We included thirteen randomised studies that compared two types of skin grafts or tissue replacements with standard care and four randomised studies that compared two grafts or tissue replacements with each other. In total 1655 patients were randomised in these seventeen trials. Risk of bias was variable among studies. The biggest drawbacks were the lack of blinding (i.e. patients and investigators were aware who was receiving the experimental therapy and who was receiving the standard therapy), industry involvement and the possibility that small studies were less likely to be published if they reported 'negative' results. Adverse advent rates (harm due to the treatment) varied widely. Based on the seventeen studies included in this review, skin grafts and tissue replacements, used in conjunction with standard care, increase the healing rate of foot ulcers and lead to slightly fewer amputations in people with diabetes compared with standard care alone. However, evidence of long term effectiveness is lacking and cost-effectiveness is uncertain. There was not enough evidence for us to be able to recommend a specific type of skin graft or tissue replacement.
This plain language summary is up-to-date as of 9 April 2015.
We looked at all the published scientific literature and found 18 trials, involving a total of 6407 participants, that were of sufficient quality to include in this review. Eight trials tested the effect of duloxetine on painful diabetic neuropathy and six on the pain of fibromyalgia. Three trials treated painful physical symptoms associated with depression and one small study investigated duloxetine for the pain from strokes or diseases of the spinal cord (central pain). The usual dose of duloxetine is 60 mg. At this dose, there was moderate quality evidence that duloxetine reduced pain in both painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy and fibromyalgia. In diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, a 50% or better improvement with duloxetine 60 mg per day was just over one and a half times more likely than with placebo. Another way of saying this is that five people with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy had to receive duloxetine to achieve a 50% or better response in one person. The effect on fibromyalgia was similar but the number needed to treat for one person to improve by 50% or more was eight. On the basis of a single study it is not possible to determine if a dose of 20 mg is effective, and 120 mg was no more effective than 60 mg.
We calculated that for diabetic neuropathy there have been enough trials to draw these conclusions and no more trials are needed. In fibromyalgia and the painful symptoms associated with depression, more trials are required to make convincing statements about the effectiveness of duloxetine.
Most people taking duloxetine will have at least one side effect. These are mostly minor and the most common are feeling sick, being too awake or too sleepy, headache, dry mouth, constipation or dizziness. About one in six people stop duloxetine because of side effects. Serious problems caused by duloxetine are very rare.
Although duloxetine is beneficial in the treatment of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia there is little evidence from trials comparing duloxetine to other antidepressant drugs as to which is better.
We have concluded that duloxetine is useful for treating pain caused by diabetic neuropathy and probably fibromyalgia.
The information in this review is up to date to November 2013, the most recent search of the literature.
This review includes a total of seven studies, involving 582 women and examines which techniques are safest for mother and baby. The risk of bias in trials was variable, with some trials not adequately describing the methods of randomisation.
At an emergency caesarean after a long labour, there is evidence from the developing world that delivery of the buttocks or feet of the baby first (reverse breech extraction) is safer than delivery of the head by pushing from the vagina back into the uterus. In four trials involving 357 women, delivery of the buttocks or feet first was associated with fewer adverse outcomes for the mother, including less bleeding, infection and a shorter operation duration. There was no significant difference in trauma to the baby but admission to special care or neonatal intensive care was decreased with delivery of the buttocks or feet first than when the head was pushed up from the vagina.
At a planned, non-labouring caesarean section there is limited evidence to support techniques (forceps or vacuum extractor on the baby's head) other than the use of the surgeon's hands to deliver the head of the baby through the uterine incision. Two trials involving 128 women compared forceps/vacuum with manual delivery without any significance difference in outcomes.
There is also insufficient evidence to support the use of medication to relax the uterus (tocolysis) at the time of a caesarean to assist with safe delivery of the baby, with only one trial involving 97 women addressing this question.
We wanted to find out if any of these approaches were better than the other to improve:
- ankle function (how well a person can do activities involving the ankle, and issues like ankle pain or swelling);
- quality of life;
- treatment satisfaction (how satisfied someone is with their treatment); and
- pain.
We also wanted to find out if any of these approaches were associated with an increased risk of having extra surgery (at a later date) on the ankle. We searched for studies that looked at different approaches for improving recovery after an ankle fracture. We compared and summarised the results of studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 53 studies involving 4489 adults with a broken ankle. Most people in the studies had surgery to help fix the bone, and others used only ankle supports (with no surgery) in the first few weeks after injury.  Early weight-bearing after surgery for a broken ankle probably leads to very slightly better ankle function (though the difference might not be big enough to matter). Although it may also lead to a better quality of life, the difference might not be big enough to matter. We could not tell if there were differences between the two approaches for people's treatment satisfaction or pain. There may be little or no difference between approaches in how many people need extra ankle surgery. - For people who have surgery after their injury, a removable ankle support may lead to better ankle function (though for some people it may not be a big enough difference to be important). Similarly, people are probably more likely to have a better quality of life (though the difference might not always be important). We could not tell if there were differences between types of ankle support in terms of pain. There may be little or no difference between ankle supports in the need for extra ankle surgery.
- For people who didn't need surgery, there may be little or no difference between types of ankle support in ankle function or quality of life. We could not tell if there were differences between ankle supports in terms of pain or the need for ankle surgery at a later date.
No studies in this comparison reported treatment satisfaction. Studies examined types of therapy that were all very different from one another (including different exercise programmes or different equipment to exercise the ankle). Studies were often small, and we could not tell if any of the approaches were better than another. These studies did not report how many people needed later surgery. We could not always be confident in the evidence because people in the studies always knew which approach was being used for their ankle. Some findings showed that there may have been little or no difference. Some studies were very small, and sometimes the approaches were very different from one another. The evidence is current to March 2023.
We looked at the evidence up to February 2013 and found 1666 studies. We included eight studies in our review and seven studies (involving 772 patients) in our meta-analysis. The studies involved people who were in an unstable condition and critically ill. They were given one dose of etomidate or another sedative agent for endotracheal intubation. We reran the search in August 2014. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review. No strong evidence exists to suggest that etomidate, when compared to other bolus dose induction agents, increases mortality in critically ill patients. We must be careful in interpreting this finding because only large studies would be able to show a difference in mortality. So far, no such study has been completed.
Etomidate does seem to impair adrenal gland functioning. Functioning is impaired most between four and six hours after etomidate is given.
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores are used to find out how badly someone’s organs are failing. Using etomidate results in worse SOFA scores but this difference is small and not clinically meaningful.
The effects of impaired adrenal gland functioning and higher SOFA scores on people’s health is unknown. Using etomidate does not seem to increase the length of time someone is in hospital (including an intensive care unit), the length of time a person is connected to a mechanical ventilator (a machine to assist with breathing), or the use of vasopressors (medicines to increase blood pressure). Most of the evidence was moderate quality. This is mainly because some small studies we looked at did not check up on people adequately after they were intubated.
Most people that were involved in one study were intubated because they were in a coma. These people comprise 42% of those involved in the studies we looked at. People in a coma are unlike other critically ill people because they may not benefit to the same extent from having stable blood pressure during endotracheal intubation, which etomidate provides, nor are they at high risk from impaired adrenal gland function compared to other critically ill patients, for example those with severe infection.
We searched for studies (to 30 July 2020) exploring aids used to help people with a breathing tube to communicate. We found 11 studies involving 1931 participants admitted to intensive care units. We also looked for studies involving people needing a breathing tube and living at home or in long-term care, but found none. Eight studies used communication boards or apps. Three studies used aids that help a patient to speak with the breathing tube in place. All studies compared the communication aid to routine communication practices. For six studies, routine practice did not include use of any type of communication aid. For the remaining five studies, usual care comprised a range of communication aids routinely used in the participating intensive care units including a communication board, paper notepad, and routine timing of the use of speech aids. We are unsure about whether the early use of aids to help with speaking may increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood or shorten the time to be able to speak. The evidence was of very low quality.
Similarly, compared to routine care in which an aid is not used, we are uncertain about the effects of communication boards on patient satisfaction. We are not sure about the effect on psychological distress and quality of life due to uncertainty in the evidence. Communication aids that help people to speak may have little or no effect on intensive care unit length of stay (low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of possible harms  with use of communication aids as only three studies reported this, and all measured different adverse events, and two were very small studies. We are unsure whether using speaking aids in intensive care might increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood. Use of communication boards may increase patient satisfaction, but we are not sure of these findings because of very low-quality evidence. This means further studies are likely to change our understanding of the effects of communication aids. More studies are needed to understand the effects of communication aids, particularly effects on psychological well-being and people's ability to communicate.
We reviewed the evidence up to November 2016. We found four studies, including 1342 people, that attempted to answer this question. All participants had asthma; participants in three studies were children and those in one study were adults. Three studies took place in the United States and one in the Netherlands; studies lasted from six months to two years. Different studies used different methods of shared decision-making, including face-to-face discussions, telephone calls, and online messages. Because these studies were conducted in different ways, we were unable to combine their findings. We found evidence from individual studies indicating that shared decision-making may improve quality of life and asthma control and may reduce healthcare visits for asthma. Shared decision-making may also help people to take their asthma inhaler(s) more regularly owing to better understanding of why they need to do that. Going through this process may make people feel more satisfied with their care, as they may feel empowered about making choices. However, all of these findings were reported by different studies, and some studies showed benefit of shared decision-making, while others did not. It is important to mention that none of these studies looked into whether shared decision-making causes unwanted side effects. All four studies measured how well the shared decision-making intervention had been delivered or received but did this in different ways. We were not very confident in the quality of the evidence presented in this review. We were concerned about the small number of studies and about differences in the way included studies were designed. Also, participants knew which group they were in (i.e. shared decision-making or standard care), and this may have affected how they answered questions about their asthma during the trial. Some evidence suggests that shared decision-making might help people with asthma, but we are not sure whether it is helpful. In the future, larger studies that include adolescents while looking out for side effects, harms, and benefits should prove useful in answering this question.
Investigation 1
We found four studies (7333 children) carried out in Sweden (one), Australia (two) and the UK (one) that looked at the effect of whooping cough vaccines on allergic diseases. As we found little reliable data about the risk of food allergy after whooping cough vaccine, we decided to look at the risk of any allergic disease. Within 2.5 years of receiving a whooping cough vaccine (one RCT), 37/137 children vaccinated with wP, and 114/360 vaccinated with aP were diagnosed with at least one allergic disease. During the same period 15/137 vaccinated with wP and 38/360 vaccinated with aP were diagnosed with asthma specifically. No studies assessed serious or potentially life-threatening allergic reactions.
Investigations 2 & 3
Low numbers of serious unwanted effects were reported for all groups (15 studies, 38,072 children). For every 1000 babies vaccinated with a first dose of wP, 11 had at least one serious unwanted effect. The risk for those who received aP vaccines was 12 children. No cases of encephalopathy were identified in either group (seven studies, 115,271 children). One RCT reporting on whooping cough vaccines and allergic diseases included few children, and was carried out in a country with low levels of allergic disease. Therefore, it remains very uncertain whether a first dose of wP does or does not decrease the risk of allergic diseases.
Very few children experienced serious unwanted effects. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of serious unwanted effects in children vaccinated with a first dose of wP, compared with aP, but any difference is likely to be small. No cases of encephalopathy following vaccination were reported. Because this is a serious outcome, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low. Ongoing and future studies may change our conclusions and provide more definitive evidence. The data reviewed suggest that wP is safe and support its continued use in countries where it is still recommended for preventing whooping cough.
For a tapered dose treatment to reduce withdrawal symptoms, illicit opioids are replaced by methadone or another agent using decreasing doses up to 30 days under medical supervision. The review authors searched the medical literature and identified 23 controlled trials involving 2467 adult opioid users in various countries. Trial participants were randomised to receive methadone or another pharmacological treatment. The other treatments were adrenergic agonists such as lofexidine, partial opioid agonists such as buprenorphine, opioid agonists such as LAAM (levo-α-acetyl-methadol) and the anxiolytics chlordiazepoxide and buspirone. In the two studies that compared methadone with placebo, withdrawal symptoms were more severe and more people dropped out in the placebo group.
The studies included in this review confirmed that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long- acting opioids, could reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless, the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use. The medications used in the included studies were similar in terms of overall effectiveness, although symptoms experienced by participants differed according to the medication used and the program adopted.
The programs varied widely with regard to the assessment of outcome measures. Seventeen of the included trials were conducted in inpatient settings.
We want to find out the effects of different methods for treating fractures of the lower femur in adults. Effects included: function scores, pain, quality of life (QoL) and any complications that arose as a result of the management method. We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (studies where patients are randomly assigned a treatment group) and quasi-RCTs (where patients are assigned a treatment group with no randomisation), published up to October 2021.
We summarised each study's results, assessing our confidence in the evidence based upon the study's methods and size. We found 14 relevant studies with 753 participants with these fractures. Thirteen studies compared different surgical implants and one study compared surgery with non-surgical treatment.  we are uncertain of any differences in function or QoL. There is no evidence to suggest any differences in complications. we are uncertain of any differences in QoL between these two methods. We are uncertain of any differences in complications. we found no evidence of any differences in complications between these two methods. We did not have any data for QoL or pain. we found no evidence of fewer complications in plates that are fixed compared with a plate that locks. We did not have any data for QoL or pain. there were limited data available for our analysis, but there is no evidence to suggest any differences in complications between these two methods. at six months there is evidence to suggest improved patient outcome scores with a specific plate called a mono-axial plate, but this improvement was not shown at 12 months. When using x-rays to assess the function of the plates, there was evidence to suggest better x-rays with a plate called a poly-axial plate. There was no evidence to suggest differences in adverse events. we are uncertain of an improved patient-reported score in a mono-axial plate compared with a condylar buttress plate. there are few data reported for this comparison. However, there were more complications such as pressures sores due to the long duration of not moving associated with the non-surgical group, who stayed on average one month longer in hospital. Each of the studies was small and designed in a way that may affect the reliability of their findings. Most studies did not report the function scores and so it was difficult to compare. We are uncertain if these results are a true reflection of what is best for patients. We searched for studies published up to 26 October 2021.
In the best designed trials, light to moderate smokers did slightly better than heavy smokers (the US COMMIT study), and men did a little better than women (the Australian CART study), but overall smoking rates remained similar between intervention and control communities.
fifteen studies were included on 425 participants with COPD. However, only 12 studies provided sufficient information for analysis across one or more of the three comparisons described above. when arm training was compared to no arm training or a sham intervention in people with COPD, there was a small improvement in breathlessness. However, this improvement was not evident when the studies of combined arm and leg training were compared to leg training alone. No studies have examined whether breathlessness improves more with different types of arm training. Arm training had no effect on quality of life in any of the three comparisons. When endurance arm training was specifically examined, there was an improvement seen in the capacity of the arms to move and lift light weights compared to no training. These effects were not seen with arm strength training. the quality of the included studies was low to moderate due to the small number of participants (ranging from 12 to 43 participants per study), missing information on the methods of the study, and incomplete data on the outcomes. some form of arm training can provide a small improvement to breathlessness but does not improve the quality of life of people with COPD. More specifically, endurance arm training can increase the capacity of the arms to move light weights in people with COPD.
We found seven studies that examined five talking therapies among 825 people with drug problems.
Cognitive-behavioural coping skills training (CBCST) is a talking therapy that focuses on changing the way people think and act.
The twelve-step programme is based on theories from Alcoholics Anonymous and aims to motivate the person to develop a desire to stop using drugs or alcohol.
Motivational interviewing (MI) helps people to explore and resolve doubts about changing their behaviour. It can be delivered in group, individual and intensive formats.
Brief motivational interviewing (BMI) is a shorter MI that takes 45 minutes to three hours.
Brief interventions are based on MI but they take only five to 30 minutes and are often delivered by a non-specialist.
Six of the studies were funded by the National Institutes for Health or by the Health Research Board; one study did not report its funding source. We found that the talking therapies led to no differences, or only small differences, for the outcomes assessed. These included abstinence, reduced drinking, and substance use.
One study found that there may be no difference between CBCST and the twelve-step programme.
Three studies found that there may be no difference between brief intervention and usual treatment.
Three studies found that there may be no difference between MI and usual treatment or education only.
One study found that BMI is probably better at reducing alcohol use than usual treatment (needle exchange), but found no differences in other outcomes.
One study found that intensive MI may be somewhat better than standard MI at reducing severity of alcohol use disorder among women, but not among men and found no differences in other outcomes.
It remains uncertain whether talking therapies reduce alcohol and drug use in people who also have problems with other drugs. High-quality studies are missing and are needed. The quality of the evidence was moderate for brief and intensive motivational interviewing, but low for brief interventions and standard motivational interviewing, and very low for CBCST versus twelve-step programme.
The patients included in the 13 trials we identified were adults with acute leukemia or solid organ transplantation and children with acute leukemia. This review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found that prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic effective against PCP, significantly reduced the occurrence of PCP by 85%. We found no evidence for a reduction in all cause mortality. Confidence in the results for PCP was moderate to high, while for mortality it was low due to paucity of data. Preventive treatment was not associated with an increased rate of adverse events. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may be administered thrice weekly as effectively as once daily.
Based on our results, the number of people that need to be treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for a prolonged period of time (ranging between several weeks to three years in the included trials) in order to prevent one episode of PCP infection was 19; when PCP infection occurs at a rate of about 6% without prophylaxis. Given the low rate of adverse events, prophylaxis should be considered for patients at similar risk of PCP.
Thirty trials were included in this review. All the pills studied were comparable with regard to preventing pregnancy. Women using levonorgestrel-containing pills were less likely to stop taking them than women using norethisterone-containing pills. Women using a gestodene-containing pill experienced less bleeding between periods than women using a levonorgestrel-containing pill but this needs further investigation. There is insufficient good quality evidence to draw any other conclusions.
We set out to undertake a systematic review comparing randomised controlled trials that examined the efficacy and safety of PD and BTX injection in people with achalasia. We searched databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library) in April 2014 for reports of relevant randomised controlled trials. Seven randomised controlled trials were identified for inclusion in the review, and five were suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis suggested that, although both interventions had similar initial response rates, the remission rates at six and 12 months were significantly greater with PD than with BTX injection.
Antiplatelet agents like aspirin are effective for preventing serious vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation not suitable for oral anticoagulants. Atrial fibrillation is an irregularity of the heartbeat that leads to blood clots forming in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). These clots can break free and travel through the bloodstream to the brain and cause a stroke. Drugs that slow clotting, such as antiplatelet agents (aspirin and others) and anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. In this review the benefits of antiplatelet agents are shown to be modest (nearly 25% decrease in stroke), but they are relatively safe, easy to take, and therefore an important treatment option for many atrial fibrillation patients. Anticoagulation with warfarin and related drugs offers more protection against stroke (nearly two-thirds reduction), but anticoagulant drugs can cause severe bleeding and require careful regulation with regular blood tests. The choice of antiplatelet drugs versus anticoagulants should be individualized based on the patient's inherent risk of stroke, ability to tolerate anticoagulation without bleeding, access to adequate anticoagulation monitoring, and patient preferences.
Studies have shown that interventions for reducing either total serum cholesterol or low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke events in people with a history of CHD. However, for stroke patients the relation between the level of serum cholesterol and cholesterol subfractions with the risk of future stroke or cardiovascular events is unclear. This review, which includes eight studies involving approximately 10,000 participants, shows statin therapy, but not other lipid-lowering measures, reduces the risk of subsequent major vascular events and a marginal benefit in decreasing stroke events, but not all-cause mortality in those with a history of ischaemic cerebrovascular disease.
Four studies including 262 adult participants with Crohn's disease in remission were included. One study (33 participants) compared an elemental diet to a non-elemental (polymeric) diet. One study (51 participants) compared an elemental diet to a normal diet (no supplements). One study (95 participants) compared an elemental diet to 6-mercaptopurine or a no treatment control group. One study (83 participants) compared a non-elemental polymeric diet to mesalamine. The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to 27 July 2018.
The study comparing an elemental diet to a polymeric diet found no difference in remission rates at 12 months. Six elemental diet participants were not able to tolerate the enteral nutritional formula because of taste or smell and were withdrawn from the study. Participants who received half of their total daily calorie requirements as elemental diet and the remaining half by normal diet had a lower chance of relapse at 12 months compared to participants who received a free diet. No side effects were reported in this study. The study comparing an elemental diet to 6-mercaptopurine did not show any difference in relapse rates at 12 months. There was no difference in side effect rates. The only side effect reported in the elemental diet group was surgery due to worsening Crohn's disease. Side effects in the 6-mercaptopurine group included liver injury in two participants, hair loss in one participant and surgery to treat an abscess in one participant. The study comparing a polymeric diet to mesalamine found no difference in relapse rates at six months. Two participants the polymeric diet group experienced nausea and four had diarrhoea. It is unclear if any participants in the mesalamine group had side effects. No serious side effects were reported in any of the studies.
The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain and no firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of enteral nutrition for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease can be drawn. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of using enteral nutrition as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. Currently, there are four ongoing studies (estimated enrolment of 280 participants). This review will be updated when the results of these studies are available.
This summary of an updated Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the benefits and harms of manual therapy and exercise in people with frozen shoulder. After searching for all relevant studies published up to May 2013, we included 32 trials (1836 participants). Among the included participants, 54% were women, average age was 55 years and average duration of the condition was six months. The average duration of manual therapy and exercise interventions was four weeks. —manual therapy and exercise compared with glucocorticoid (a steroid that reduces inflammation) injection into the shoulder
Pain (higher scores mean worse pain)
People who had manual therapy and exercise for six weeks did not improve as much as people who had glucocorticoid injection—improvement in pain was 26 points less (ranging from 15 to 37 points less) at seven weeks (26% absolute less improvement).
• People who had manual therapy and exercise rated their change in pain score as 32 points on a scale of 0 to 100 points.
• People who had glucocorticoid injection rated their change in pain score as 58 points on a scale of 0 to 100 points.
Function (lower scores mean better function)
People who had manual therapy and exercise for six weeks did not improve as much as people who had glucocorticoid injection—improvement in function was 25 points less (ranging from 15 to 35 points less) at seven weeks (25% absolute less improvement).
• People who had manual therapy and exercise rated their change in function as 14 points on a scale of 0 to 100 points.
• People who had glucocorticoid injection rated their change in function as 39 points on a scale of 0 to 100 points.
Treatment success
31 fewer people out of 100 rated their treatment as successful with manual therapy and exercise for six weeks compared with glucocorticoid injection—31% absolute less improvement (ranging from 13% to 48% less improvement).
• 46 out of 100 people reported treatment success with manual therapy and exercise.
• 77 out of 100 people reported treatment success with glucocorticoid injection.
Side effects
Out of 100 people, three had minor side effects such as temporary pain after treatment with manual therapy and exercise for six weeks compared with glucocorticoid injection.
• 56 out of 100 people reported side effects with manual therapy and exercise.
• 53 out of 100 people reported side effects with glucocorticoid injection. Evidence of moderate quality shows that the combination of manual therapy and exercise probably improves pain and function less than glucocorticoid injection up to seven weeks, and probably does not result in more adverse events. Further research may change the estimate.
Low-quality evidence suggests that (1) the combination of manual therapy, exercise and electrotherapy (such as therapeutic ultrasound) may not improve pain or function more than glucocorticoid injection or placebo injection into the shoulder, (2) the combination of manual therapy, exercise, electrotherapy and glucocorticoid injection may not improve pain or function more than glucocorticoid injection alone and (3) the combination of manual therapy, exercise, electrotherapy and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) may not improve function more than oral NSAID alone. Further research is likely to change the estimate.
High-quality evidence shows that following arthrographic joint distension, the combination of manual therapy and exercise does not improve pain or function more than sham ultrasound, but may provide greater patient-reported treatment success and active range of motion. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
No trial compared the combination of manual therapy and exercise versus placebo or no intervention.
This review set out to compare both techniques. Our literature search has shown that a well-designed randomised trial comparing surgery and radiosurgery for patients with solitary brain metastasis has never been performed. Therefore, this review has been unable to show any advantage of one treatment over the other for this group of patients.
Cochrane Oral Health provided the search strategies and carried out the search in several electronic databases. We selected nine randomised trials for inclusion in this review that were conducted between 1998 and 2014. The evidence in the review is up to date as of 22 June 2016. The trials involved a total of 662 participants, with 1498 teeth treated. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one in Taiwan, one in China, one in Bulgaria, one in Germany, one in Turkey and one in the UK. The population consisted of both children and adolescents in four trials, only adults in four trials, and both children/adolescents and adults in one trial. Despite the number of included studies, only a few trials adequately and completely reported information on the primary outcomes. Two trials reported on removal of decay, and there was not enough evidence to conclude that either lasers or drills were better at decay removal. Only five trials reported on episodes of pain, which was significantly reduced in people treated with lasers. There was no difference in terms of side effects, such as inflammation or death of dental pulp, between the two interventions. The overall quality of the evidence for the nine studies was low. Only one study adequately randomised participants, and none of the included studies was at low risk of bias. This review highlights the need for high-quality studies comparing laser therapy and mechanical drills in the treatment of dental decay.
We wanted to find out if RSV vaccination during pregnancy was better than no treatment or placebo (dummy treatment) for preventing hospitalisations associated with RSV disease in infants. We also wanted to find out if RSV vaccination during pregnancy was safe for mothers and their babies, by looking at whether it had an effect on fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, maternal death, preterm birth, birth defects, and infant death. We searched for studies that compared RSV vaccination with no treatment or placebo during pregnancy. We compared and summarised their results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods. We found six studies that compared RSV vaccination with placebo in a total of 17,991 pregnant women. The studies lasted between 90 days and 365 days and took place in multiple countries around the world (USA was the most common country). All studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The pregnant women were aged up to 49 years. The timing of vaccination varied, from 24 weeks to 36 weeks of pregnancy.
Evidence from four studies shows that RSV vaccination during pregnancy reduces the number of infants hospitalised with RSV disease. For every 1000 pregnant women who receive the vaccination, 11 infants will be admitted to hospital with RSV disease, compared with 22 infants for every 1000 women who receive placebo.
Evidence from four studies shows that RSV vaccination has little or no effect on the risk of birth defects and probably has little or no effect on the risk of fetal growth restriction. There were no safety concerns about the risk of stillbirth, maternal death, and infant death, but these results are less certain. RSV vaccination during pregnancy might increase the risk of preterm births, but the results are very uncertain. More research is needed to give a clearer result and investigate possible causes. We are confident that RSV vaccination during pregnancy reduces infant hospitalisations and does not increase birth defects. We are less confident in the other findings because some of the studies were poorly conducted, and the evidence is based on only a few events. The evidence is current to 27 July 2023.
We searched for published articles describing randomised clinical trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) to identify the role of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, and found five studies with a total of 931 participants. Four studies (867 participants) compared surgery and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (mitomycin-C and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); gemcitabine; gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin; or capecitabine) with surgery alone (no postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy). One study (70 participants; 64 with cholangiocarcinoma and 6 with gallbladder carcinoma) compared surgery and a new adjuvant oral chemotherapy (S-1) (fluoropyrimidine derivative) versus surgery and adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.
Funding: two trials received support from drug companies; one trial received funding from the Japan Society of Clinical Oncology; one trial received support from "Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique (PHRC 2009) and Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer"; and one trial did not provide information on support or sponsorship.
We also identified six ongoing randomised clinical trials. We are very unsure as to whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has any effect on death from any cause. Only one trial reported on adverse events. Whilst this trial indicated that postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy could increase serious adverse events, this result is very uncertain due to the lack of studies (i.e. only one found) and the low number of participants. No information was available on quality of life, death from cancer, time to tumour recurrence, and non-serious adverse events. Due to poor study quality, an insufficient number of studies, and low number of participants, the effects of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy versus no postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy on mortality and serious adverse events are very uncertain. More randomised clinical trials designed with better study methods and larger participant numbers are needed.
Eight randomised controlled trials (257 participants) were included in this review. Essential L-amino acids may shorten the overall duration of kidney dysfunction and improved survival from AKI. However, due to the small number of participants and the poor quality of some studies, we are unable to provide recommendations for the use of nutritional support for treating AKI.
We wanted to find out colchicine's benefits and harms in preventing ACVD before it ever occurs (primary prevention) in the general population. Primary prevention is all about taking steps to prevent a disease before it even develops, rather than waiting until someone is already sick to start treatment. In the case of ACVD, this is especially important because it is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. By focusing on prevention, people can be helped to live longer, healthier lives with a resulting reduced burden on healthcare systems. One approach to primary prevention is using immunomodulating medications, which work by modifying the immune system's response. Colchicine is one example of this type of medication. We looked at the effects of colchicine for primary prevention of ACVD, including heart attacks, strokes, death from cardiovascular causes, and death for any reason. We also looked at unwanted effects such as diarrhoea and neurological events (seizure and mental confusion). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 15 studies involving 1721 participants with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 728 weeks, comparing colchicine with placebo (dummy pill), immunomodulating medications, or usual care. Colchicine was taken by mouth as a pill, either once or twice a day, depending on the regimen being followed. The people included in the studies were adults at high risk for developing ACVD, but who had not yet had a major cardiovascular event like a heart attack or stroke. The risk factors considered included age, family history, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and presence of other conditions like diabetes. The evidence for the effects of colchicine on preventing cardiovascular events is very uncertain. Although the current evidence does not suggest clear benefits or a reduction in ACVD complications, this conclusion is limited by the quality of the evidence. Further high-quality studies are essential to accurately determine the benefits and harms of colchicine for the primary prevention of ACVD. Our confidence in the evidence is very low because of concerns about how some of the studies were conducted, results that differed across studies, and changes to the intended populations or treatments. The studies were very small, and analyses included only a few studies. The evidence is current to 31 May 2023.
This meta-analysis quantitatively summarizes the results of the ten randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing HAI with systemic chemotherapy (SCT). Our findings show that administration of fluoropyrimidines through HAI yields higher tumor response rates as compared to the SCT regimens used in the analysed RCT. However, this anticancer activity does not translate into a significant survival advantage for patients treated with HAI as compared to those given SCT. Also considering that modern SCT can achieve higher response rates as compared to the regimens adopted in the analysed RCT, the currently available evidence does not support the clinical or investigational use of fluoropyrimidine-HAI alone for the treatment of patients with unresectable CRC liver metastases.
We included data from two trials, which included 87 participants. The trials compared surgical with non-surgical treatment for these fractures in the thoracolumbar region of the spine. Both trials had limitations in their methods that could reduce the reliability of their results. They reported contrasting results for patient pain and function at a minimum of two years after treatment. One study found patients had less pain and better function after surgery compared with patients who did not have surgery. The other trial found the opposite. Both trials found there were more early complications in the surgical group and only participants of this group had subsequent additional surgery. This involved the removal of the implant either to resolve a complication or routinely. One trial reported that surgery was over four times more costly than non-surgical treatment.
Our review concluded that the weak evidence from these two trials was insufficient to say whether surgery or non-surgical treatment was better for these fractures. However, surgery is likely to be associated with more early complications and the need for subsequent surgery, as well as greater initial healthcare costs.
Six trials (553 participants) were included in this review. Following analysis of the data, no significant change was seen in the loudness of tinnitus or the overall severity of tinnitus following the use of sound therapy compared to other interventions such as patient education, 'relaxation techniques', 'tinnitus coping strategies', counselling, 'tinnitus retraining' and exposure to environmental sounds. No side effects were reported from the use of sound-creating devices.
The limited data from the studies included in the review failed to show strong evidence of the efficacy of sound therapy in tinnitus management, however the absence of conclusive evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. There is a lack of quality research in this area and also combined approaches (hearing therapy plus counselling) are commonly used in the management of tinnitus. Optimal management of tinnitus may involve multiple strategies.
People with hypercholesterolemia have a higher risk of developing coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and stroke. Chinese herbal medicines have been commonly used and studied as cholesterol-lowering agents. To evaluate the effects of various herbal formulations (including single herbs, Chinese proprietary medicines, and mixtures of different herbs) for treating hypercholesterolemia, this review examined 22 randomized controlled trials of five different Chinese herbal medicines. The trials lasted from one to six months (average 2.3 months) and involved 2130 participants. There were no data on cardiovascular events and death from any cause. One trial each reported on well-being (no significant differences) and economic costs . No serious adverse events were observed. The available evidence suggests that several herbal medicines showed some cholesterol-lowering effect. However, due to considerable limitations in the quality of the included trials, further higher-quality and rigorously performed studies are required before any confident conclusions can be reached about the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for hypercholesterolemia.
Anticholinergic medicines are commonly used to treat a number of medical conditions that people with dementia frequently experience. Typical examples are medicines used to treat urinary tract infections or episodes of agitation. However, because the cholinergic system in the brain plays an important role in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the use of anticholinergic medicines may unintentionally exacerbate psychological problems in this population. In this review, we investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and future occurrence of undesirable clinical outcomes in people with dementia. We searched for studies that looked at the link between anticholinergic medicines and a range of clinical outcomes in people with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes. We found a total of 18 studies, involving 102,684 adults aged 50 years or more, who had issues with memory and thinking. We found that the evidence was highly inconsistent regarding the link between anticholinergic medicines and increased issues with memory and thinking in people with dementia. There were no studies that investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and frequency of behavioural disturbances. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about whether anticholinergic medicines cause issues with memory and thinking, or behavioural disturbances in this population. However, we did find there was a more consistent link between anticholinergic medicines and the risk of death. Those who were taking anticholinergic medicines had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who were not taking anticholinergic medicines. The available evidence is very low certainty because of the inconsistency of study results, and the lack of control for health conditions that could be linked with both the clinical outcomes and the prescribing of anticholinergic medicines themselves. It is possible that anticholinergic medicines may not actually cause death, but are simply more likely to be given to people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems. We searched for studies published up to 29 November 2021.
This systematic review confirmed the effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for relief of symptoms for severe carpal tunnel syndrome up to one month after injection. Local corticosteroid injection provides significantly greater clinical improvement compared to oral corticosteroid up to three months after treatment. Two injections of local corticosteroid do not provide significant further clinical improvement of symptoms. Further research is required to determine length of benefit of local corticosteroid injection and benefit for mild and moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.
In this review the effect of whole grain foods and cereal fibre (as a marker of whole-grain food intake) on the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was assessed using all available prospective cohort studies and randomised controlled trials. Only one randomised controlled trial was found which was of low methodological quality. This study investigated in 12 overweight persons during six weeks the effect of the consumption of refined grain foods versus that of whole grain foods on insulin sensitivity (risk factor for the development of T2DM). Intake of whole grain foods resulted in a slight improvement of insulin sensitivity, increased bowel movements and no adverse effects. No information was given about patient satisfaction, health related quality of life, total mortality and morbidity. In addition eleven prospective cohort studies were found. One study was conducted in Finland and the rest in the United States of America of which seven were done in health care workers. Some of the studies were of limited quality. They consistently showed that a high intake of whole grain foods or cereal fibre is associated with a lower risk of the development of T2DM. However, evidence for a protective effect coming from prospective cohort studies only has to be considered as weak as with this design no cause and effect relationship can be established. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to be able to draw definite conclusions about the preventive effects of whole grain consumption on development of T2DM.
We searched the medical literature up to December 2015, and identified 77 relevant studies with 6603 participants, with mainly mild to moderate eczema. Participant age ranged from four months to 84 years (mean: 18.6 years). Most studies lasted between two and six weeks; a few lasted six months.
Forty-six studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies. Most moisturisers appeared to be effective. Twenty-four studies reported participant-assessed eczema severity. Only 13 studies assessed participant satisfaction with the moisturiser. Side effects (adverse events) were reported in 41 studies, although this information was often limited (mainly smarting, stinging, itch, redness). Most studies evaluated physician-assessed severity of eczema (65 studies). Other outcomes addressed were skin barrier function (29 studies), flare prevention (16), quality of life (10), and corticosteroid use (8).
According to physicians, moisturisers reduced eczema severity compared with no moisturiser (3 studies), but the reduction was too small to be considered meaningful for patients. Moisturiser use resulted in fewer flares (2 studies), and reduced the need for topical corticosteroids (2 studies). Participant-assessed eczema severity and satisfaction were not evaluated. There was no difference in the number of adverse events reported.
Participants thought Atopiclair (containing glycyrrhetinic acid) was more than four times more effective at improving eczema-severity than the control (i.e. identical looking, but without glycyrrhetinic acid) (3 studies). However, physicians did not identify a meaningful difference for patients. Atopiclair led to greater reduction of itch (4 studies), more frequent participant satisfaction (2 studies), and fewer flares (3 studies). The number of reported adverse events was similar in each group.
Four studies evaluated urea-containing cream. Participants using urea cream reported improvement more often than those using control (1 study). Satisfaction ratings in both groups were comparably positive (1 study). Urea-containing cream improved dryness more often (physician assessment) (1 study) and led to fewer flares (1 study), but with more adverse events reported.
Three studies assessed glycerol-containing moisturiser versus control. More participants in the glycerol group considered their skin to be improved (1 study), as did physicians, but these differences were not meaningful for patients. Participant satisfaction was not addressed. There was no difference in the number of adverse events reported.
Four studies investigated oat-containing moisturisers versus no treatment or control. No differences between groups were observed for participant-assessed improvement (1 study), participant satisfaction (1 study), or physician-assessed improvement (3 studies). However, the oat group had fewer flares (1 study), and a reduced need for topical corticosteroids (2 studies). Oat creams caused more adverse events.
When we compared all moisturisers against no moisturiser or control, overall, participants considered moisturisers to be more than twice as effective in improving eczema than no moisturiser or control (5 studies), and more effective for itch (7 studies). Participants in both treatment arms reported comparable satisfaction (3 studies). According to physicians, moisturisers decreased eczema severity more than the control (12 studies), and led to fewer flares (6 studies). There were no differences between groups for the number of adverse events reported.
According to physicians, topical corticosteroids were more effective at improving eczema when used with a moisturiser, rather than used alone (3 studies), and also reduced the number of flares (1 study). This combination was also favoured by participants, though participant-assessed disease severity was not addressed. There was no difference in the number of adverse events reported. There was high certainty evidence for physician-assessed disease severity for glycerol-containing creams versus control and all moisturisers versus control. For most other outcomes across comparisons, there was low to moderate certainty evidence. The most important reasons for lowering the certainty of evidence were risk of bias in studies (e.g. no blinding, or missing data), or too few participants, which leads to less precise results.
