We found six randomised controlled trials and three observational studies that assessed the effects of HAART plus chemotherapy compared with HAART alone; HAART plus chemotherapy compared with HAART plus another chemotherapy regimen; and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy in the time before HAART was available. Of the nine included studies, seven included patients with a mix of mild to moderate (T0) Kaposi's sarcoma and severe (T1) Kaposi's sarcoma. There was no universal definition for what severity of disease was considered chemotherapy-requiring. For this review, we only extracted data for 792 HIV infected adults with severe Kaposi's sarcoma disease.
The findings from this review suggest that HAART plus chemotherapy may be beneficial in reducing disease progression compared to HAART alone in patients with severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma. For patients on HAART, in choosing among different chemotherapy regimens, there was no observed difference between liposomal doxorubcin, liposomal daunorubicin, and paclitaxel. The overall quality of evidence in this review can be described as moderate.
We wanted to know whether tube feeding helps people with severe dementia who have problems with eating and swallowing.
We were interested in the effect of tube feeding on:
how long people lived;
their quality of life (well-being); and
the development or healing of pressure sores (also known as bed sores). We searched for studies that investigated whether:
PEG compared to no tube; a nasogastric tube compared to no tube; orPEG, nasogastric and other types of tube feeding compared to no tube
was effective and whether tube feeding caused any unwanted effects in adults of any age with severe dementia and poor intake of food and drink.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 14 studies that included 49,714 participants. Of these, 6203 were tube-fed and 43,511 were not. Participants with no feeding tube were given standard care or standard care with extra treatments to encourage eating and drinking. In people with severe dementia, compared to no tube feeding:
PEG may make no difference to how long people live (4 studies, 36,816 people), and leads to a small increase in the chance of developing pressure sores (1 study, 4421 people). we don’t know if nasogastric tube feeding increases the length of time people live or increases their chance of developing pressure sores, because none of our included studies gave information about these points. Studies of people with either PEG or nasogastric tubes showed tube feeding may increase the length of time people live (4 studies, 1696 people), and may slightly increase the chance of developing pressure sores (3 studies, 351 people).
None of our included studies reported quality of life. We have moderate confidence in our finding that pressure ulcers were more common in people who were fed with a PEG tube. However, we have little to very little confidence for our other findings.
Three main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, people in the studies were not randomly placed into different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments. However, due to ethical considerations it would be very difficult to do this in future studies. Secondly, results were very inconsistent across the different studies. Finally, some studies were very small.
The results of further research could differ from the results of this review. The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.
We identified three new studies for this update. In total, 69 studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. However, we could only use 56 studies (7690 participants; mean age 50 years) in further analysis.
We compared the results and summarised the evidence from the studies. After doing so, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as potentially being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty.
Moderate-certainty evidence from 13 studies (involving 1245 people) suggests that phlebotonics probably slightly reduce puffiness (oedema) compared with placebo. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that there is little or no difference in quality of life for people taking phlebotonics when compared with placebo. Low-certainty evidence suggests there is little or no difference in the proportion of healed ulcers with phlebotonics, compared with placebo. Moderate-certainty evidence from 37 studies (involving 5789 people) suggests that phlebotonics probably produce more side effects, especially gastrointestinal disorders. All evidence was of moderate or low certainty. Starting from an initial assumption of high certainty, we downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level for each outcome because of the high risk of bias, primarily due to selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data. For the outcome of ulcer healing, we downgraded by an additional level due to statistical imprecision (small number of events). With moderate-certainty evidence, we are moderately confident in the effect estimates for these outcomes. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. With low-certainty evidence, our confidence in the effect estimate for that outcome is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019.
The review includes 13 trials with a total of 711 people with schizophrenia and other psychiatric diagnoses. Due to the poor quality, small size, and limited data from the 13 studies, there is limited evidence. It is not known if strategies such as dose reduction, ‘drug holidays’, and stopping medication are helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. There is limited evidence on specific antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Evidence is poor, small scale, and of short duration. There is a need for larger trials of a longer duration in order to fully investigate this area.
This plain language summary was adapted by the review authors from a summary originally written by Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation (http://mcpin.org/).
Our team of researchers searched the medical literature for studies that compared the effects of any antimicrobial mouthwash or nasal spray administered to patients with COVID-19 against no treatment, water or a salt solution. We found no completed studies to include in this review.
We found 16 studies currently in progress that aim to enrol nearly 1250 participants. These studies are investigating a range of mouthwashes and nasal sprays.
Fourteen of the studies are randomised controlled trials (clinical, real-life studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. There is currently no evidence relating to the benefits and risks of patients with COVID-19 using antimicrobial mouthwashes or nasal sprays.
Sixteen randomised controlled trials are underway. Once these studies are completed, we will be able to analyse them and include their findings in an updated version of this review.
It is important that future studies collect and analyse information about adverse events. Few of the ongoing studies we identified specifically state that they will investigate these. If future studies show a beneficial effect of mouthwashes and nasal sprays, it may not be a large effect (very few health interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes). It will only be possible to weigh up potentially small benefits against risks if any adverse events that occur are reported in studies. We last searched for evidence on 1 June 2020. This review covered research that was available up to that date, but did not consider any evidence that may have been produced since then.
While hyperventilation therapy can reduce ICP after traumatic brain injury, the review of trials found there is no strong evidence about whether this improves outcomes. More trials are needed.
The haemopoietic colony stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are naturally occurring substances (cytokines) that can increase circulating white blood cells (neutrophils) and their ability to destroy bacteria. Common minor side effects are low grade fever and skeletal pain. The review authors identified seven treatment studies of 257 premature infants with suspected systemic bacterial infection. Adding G-CSF or GM-CSF to antibiotic therapy did not improve survival, overall. It may be, however, that infants who had clinically low neutrophils at the start of treatment did show some reduction in number of deaths by day 14 (taken from three studies). In three studies in which 359 low birthweight or premature neonates were treated preventatively (prophylaxis) no reduction in deaths was evident in those neonates receiving GM-CSF. GM-CSF was well tolerated with no adverse reactions in these small studies.
The review identified and included 27 randomised clinical trials comparing peginterferon plus ribavirin versus interferon plus ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. All trials had high risk of bias, that is, overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms. If we disregard bias from lack of blinding and industry support, then 14 trials were considered to have a lower risk of bias. All trials were able to inform on clearing virus from blood six months after the end of treatment (sustained virological response). We could not be certain that peginterferon plus ribavirin has an effect on liver-related morbidity plus all-cause mortality when compared with interferon plus ribavirin. Because so few events occurred, we cannot exclude major beneficial or detrimental effects. This review shows that peginterferon plus ribavirin compared with interferon plus ribavirin significantly increases the number of patients with sustained virological response (50.2% compared with 38.5%), but we do not yet know about any patient-relevant outcomes. Peginterferon plus ribavirin compared with interferon plus ribavirin significantly increased the risk of adverse events such as neutropenia (lack of white blood cells in the blood), thrombocytopenia (lack of blood platelets in the blood), arthralgia (joint pain), injection site reaction, and nausea, but adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation remained comparable for both treatments (12.3% versus 18.7%). Data about the influence of treatment on quality of life are insufficient. This effect on virological response seems robust to analysis controlling for the risk of random errors ('play of chance'), but it may be due to the fact that all trials were considered at high risk of bias. Furthermore, we still need to have proof that sustained virological response induced by antiviral treatment has any association with patient-relevant and clinically relevant outcomes.
Results of the seven randomised clinical trials included in the review in which patients received standard immunosuppressive treatment (steroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine or tacrolimus) with or without bile acids after liver transplantation, did not show any significant effects of bile acids on all-cause mortality, mortality related to rejection, acute cellular rejection, steroid resistant rejection, or need for retransplantation. One analysis suggested that bile acids might beneficially influence number of patients with chronic rejection, but was contradicted by the analyses. The evidence that the use of ursodeoxycholic acid might have beneficial effects on chronic rejection and length of hospitalisation is weak as it is produced from trials with high risk of bias and insufficient number of included patients. That bile acids seemed well tolerated, with no reports of serious adverse events, is good knowledge, but much more research is needed before their use is acquitted. None of the randomised clinical trials assessed the effects of bile acids on quality of life or cost-effectiveness.
This review aimed to identify clinical trials to assess the effect of different types of bereavement support interventions and/or counselling for parents experiencing perinatal death. There are no included studies on this topic. For the update of this review we identified one new trial, which is currently awaiting classification. More research in this area is needed.
This review of randomised trials found that both heparins and mechanical pumping devices significantly decrease the incidence of deep vein thrombosis. There was not enough evidence to conclude about the effect on lung (pulmonary) embolism, mortality or possible side effects for either heparin or mechanical methods.
Overall, our certainty in the evidence is very low, which means we do not have confidence that our results show the true effect of the treatments. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence because the studies were at high risk of bias (lack of blinding of participants or assessors, several outcomes were not reported and a number of the participants did not complete the studies); the trials were all small; and their results were inconsistent. In conclusion, we have found no clear difference in effect on patency, mortality or cardiovascular event rates when comparing atherectomy against balloon angioplasty with or without stenting. The limited evidence available does not support a significant advantage of atherectomy over conventional balloon angioplasty or stenting.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries to try to prevent the premature release of eggs before they can be harvested in a planned way by means of a surgical procedure. GnRHa have been shown to improve pregnancy rates. Various ways of giving GnRHa are described in the literature. We wanted to find out the most effective way of giving GnRHa to increase the number of babies born and ongoing pregnancy rates, in addition to reducing the rates of pregnancy loss and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (an unwanted effect of treatment with fertility medicines). We reviewed the evidence on which medications (in the form of GnRHa) are best given together with hormones to stimulate ovaries for women trying to become pregnant through assisted conception. We found 40 studies of 4148 women comparing the use of GnRHa in different ways during assisted conception treatment. Nineteen of these studies (1582 women) compared a long treatment (where GnRHa is started at least two weeks prior to hormone stimulation) with a short treatment (where GnRHa is started with the hormone stimulation). When comparing long versus short GnRHa treatment, there was little to no difference between groups for live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates. Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve a live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short treatment, between 12% and 30% will achieve this with a long treatment. There is evidence that the long treatment may result in a higher clinical pregnancy rate (where the foetus can be seen or heard) when compared to the short treatment. Our findings suggest that, in a population where 16% of women will achieve a clinical pregnancy with the short treatment, 17% to 32% will achieve this with a long treatment.
For other comparisons of GnRHa treatments, we are uncertain if there is any difference in terms of live birth and clinical pregnancy rate, except for the comparison of 100 µg dose versus 25 µg dose in a short treatment, which showed that clinical pregnancy may improve with a 100 µg dose.
We are uncertain if there is any difference in OHSS rates and pregnancy loss, which were reported by only two studies each.
There was not enough evidence to reach any conclusions regarding other harmful effects. Further research is needed to look at the cost-effectiveness and acceptability of the different treatments. We have low to very low confidence in the evidence. The main limitations in the evidence were non-reporting of live birth or ongoing pregnancy in half of the studies, poor reporting of study methods, unclear findings, very few studies reporting on unwanted effects such as OHSS, and lack of data regarding other harmful events, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of the treatments. Only eight of the 40 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years. The evidence is current to December 2022.
The purpose of this review was to evaluate anabolic steroids as a means of treatment of weight loss in individuals with HIV infection. The review includes 13 randomized clinical trials in the primary analysis. The results suggested that anabolic steroids increased both lean body mass and body weight. However, the results were not consistent among individual trials and the average increase was small and may not be clinically relevant. Furthermore, the results need to be interpreted with caution as this meta-analysis was limited due to small sample sizes; short duration of treatment and of follow-up; and heterogeneity of the study populations, the anabolic interventions, and concomitant therapies.
Hence, the aim of this review was to assess and synthesise the available literature on the management of cough in cancer patients in order to improve practice recommendations. Studies with chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. An extensive literature search yielded 17 studies for evaluation. For this update, we did not identify any additional studies for inclusion. Eight of the studies were about the use of brachytherapy (a technique where a radiation source is placed inside the bronchus in the lung for lung cancer or next to the area requiring treatment), use of laser resection or photodynamic therapy (a treatment that uses a drug plus a special type of light to kill cancer cells). Nine studies assessed the effects of a number of different medications, including codeine and morphine. Overall, the research was of poor quality with significant methodological problems, hence no credible evidence was available in the literature to guide practice. Acknowledging these limitations, brachytherapy in a variety of radiation doses was found to be helpful in selected patients. Some pharmacological treatments were found to be helpful, in particular morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, levodropropizine, sodium cromoglycate and butamirate citrate linctus (a cough syrup), although all studies had significant risk of bias and some reported side effects. No practice recommendations could be drawn from this review. There is an urgent need to increase the number and quality of studies evaluating the effects of interventions for the management of cough in cancer.
Traditionally, kidneys requiring transport are kept in an icebox (termed static cold storage). New technology using machines which drive cold (hypothermic machine perfusion) or warm (normothermic machine perfusion) fluids through donated kidneys aims to decrease the damage done during transport and, therefore, improve the outcomes for these kidneys.
Our primary outcome was the rate of delayed kidney function (the number of patients who needed extra dialysis support in the week following the transplant), and our main secondary outcome of interest was one-year kidney survival (the number of transplanted kidneys still working at one year). We searched for all trials that assessed the benefits and harms of using machine perfusion versus static cold storage for the transport of donated kidneys for transplantation. We compared and summarised the trials' results and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as trial methods and size. Twenty-two studies (4007 participants) were included. Most of these studies investigated hypothermic machine perfusion (21), with one study investigating normothermic machine perfusion. Compared with standard static cold storage, the use of hypothermic machine perfusion reduces the rate of delayed transplant kidney function, as well improving the survival of the transplanted kidneys. Economic analyses in the USA and European settings found cost savings with the use of hypothermic machine perfusion. Providing the kidney with extra oxygen during hypothermic machine perfusion leads to further improvements in kidney survival, kidney function and rate of kidney rejection. However, this has only been tested in a specific group of donors (deceased donors over 50 years old and who were not brain-dead). The timing of hypothermic machine perfusion appears important, with benefits only seen when machine perfusion is started at the donor hospital and continued throughout transport.
The study of normothermic machine perfusion (performed for one hour after transport with static cold storage) found no important advantages over static cold storage alone. We are confident in our findings that hypothermic machine perfusion, compared to cold static storage, reduces the rate of deleted function and transplanted kidney survival. However, we are less certain of the results for primary non-function, incidence of acute rejection, patient survival, hospital stay, long-term kidney function, and duration of delayed kidney function. The evidence is current to June 2024.
The aim of this review was to find the current evidence on how effective vagus nerve stimulation is in reducing the frequency of epileptic seizures, and any side effects associated with the treatment. Epilepsy is a disorder in which unexpected electrical discharges from the brain cause seizures. Most seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug, but sometimes, seizures do not respond to drugs. Some people need more than one antiepileptic drug to control their seizures, especially if they originate from one area of the brain (focal epilepsy), instead of involving the whole brain.
The vagus nerve runs down the side of the neck, from the brain to the large intestines, and controls body systems, like the heart and digestion. The vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) is a device that is used as an add-on treatment for epilepsy, if it does not respond well to drugs, and only affects one part of the brain. The device is connected to the vagus nerve, and sends mild electrical impulses to it. This is particularly important for treating people whose epilepsy did not respond well to drugs, who are not eligible for epilepsy surgery, or for whom surgery was not successful in reducing the frequency of their seizures. We did not identify any new studies for this update. We included five multicentre, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the last update, which recruited a total of 439 participants, and compared different types of VNS therapy. Three compared high-level stimulation to low-level stimulation in participants from 12 to 60 years old. One trial examined high frequency stimulation versus low frequency stimulation in children. One trial examined three different stimulation frequencies. Since we did not identify any new studies, the conclusions remain unchanged.
VNS seems to be an effective treatment for people with intractable focal epilepsy. High-level stimulation seems to reduce the number of seizures people had compared to low-level stimulation.
Common side effects were voice alteration and hoarseness, pain, shortness of breath, cough, feeling sickly, tingling sensation, headache, or infection at the site of the operation. Shortness of breath, voice alteration and hoarseness were more common in people receiving high-level stimulation compared to people receiving low-level stimulation. The evidence for the effectiveness and side effects of VNS therapy was limited and imprecise. There were a small number of studies and participants included in the review, and details about the design and conduct of the trials was sometimes lacking. We rated the evidence as moderate or low certainty. This means that further research is likely, or very likely, to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect, and may change the estimate. The evidence is current to 3 March 2022.
We wanted to find out whether vaccines lengthen people's survival time and time without disease progression, and whether they are associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that looked at therapeutic cancer vaccines alone or in combination with chemotherapy compared with supportive care, no treatment, or placebo (inactive or 'dummy' medicine) in people with advanced NSCLC.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 10 studies that involved 2177 participants with advanced NSCLC. The biggest study involved 419 people and the smallest study 50. Seven different types of vaccines were evaluated. Three vaccines were evaluated in 2 studies each: TG4010 vector-based vaccine; epidermal growth factor vaccine; and racotumomab. The remaining 4 vaccines were each evaluated in a single study. - None of the vaccines increased participants' survival time, except racotumomab, which may improve it slightly compared to placebo. The median survival time for those in the racotumomab vaccine group was 8.2 months, compared to 6.8 months in the group that did not receive the vaccine. (The median is the middle value of a set of numbers.)
- None of the vaccines improved progression-free survival time, except TG4010, which may increase it slightly. The median progression-free survival time for people in the TG4010 vaccine group was 5.9 months, compared to 5.1 months in the non-vaccine group.
- The 7 different vaccines tested largely appear to be safe: there were no differences between the people given vaccines and those not given vaccines in terms of serious adverse (unwanted) events. However, 1 vaccine (SLR172) added to chemotherapy increased the proportion of people having at least 1 serious adverse event. A different vaccine (OSE2101) may result in a slight decrease in the proportion of people having at least 1 serious adverse event. Our confidence in the evidence varied from moderate to very low for the different vaccines and outcomes assessed, mainly because the studies were small and there were not enough studies to be sure of the results. The evidence is current to August 2023.
We identified 48 studies with 10,200 participants of both sexes. The average age of the participants across studies ranged from 36 to 68; most studies included participants aged 18 and over. Our included studies compared the three main groups of medication against each other or to placebo. Most studies took place in outpatient dermatology settings in the USA and Europe. The participants mainly had fungal infection under the toenails. A small number of studies included a specific group of participants, such as those with diabetes. All but one study looked at fungal infections caused by dermatophyte, which are fungi that digest keratin. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years, with most lasting 12 to 15 months. The evidence is current to October 2016.
We found high-quality evidence that compared with placebo, both terbinafine and azoles are more effective for achieving a normal-looking nail and curing the toenail infection (i.e. looking at the microscopic level to see if the fungus is gone). Terbinafine or azoles may also prevent the infection reoccurring more than placebo (low-quality evidence). There was probably no significant difference in the risk of adverse events reported when comparing either azoles or terbinafine with placebo (moderate-quality evidence). The most common adverse events amongst terbinafine-treated and azole-treated participants included stomach problems and headache.
We found that compared to azoles, terbinafine was probably more effective in curing the nails in terms of appearance and infection (moderate-quality evidence). The risk of side effects was probably the same for both treatments (moderate-quality evidence), and the most common adverse events in both groups were headache, viral infection, and rash. There may be no difference in recurrence rate (low-quality evidence).
A third type of treatment, griseofulvin, was probably as effective as the azole medications in curing the nails in terms of appearance and infection (moderate-quality evidence), but it may be less effective than terbinafine when assessing the same outcomes (low-quality evidence). Griseofulvin caused more side effects than the other two treatments, although the quality of the evidence was moderate (compared to azole) to low (compared to terbinafine). The most common adverse events in both groups included stomach problems and feeling sick. We are uncertain about the effect of griseofulvin compared to azoles on the rate of recurrence, and studies comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin did not assess this outcome. The evidence for the primary outcomes of cure (in terms of appearance and infection) was high to moderate quality except for the comparisons of griseofulvin versus terbinafine (low quality) and combination terbinafine plus azole versus terbinafine alone (very low quality). The evidence quality for side effects was mainly moderate, but two comparisons had low evidence for this outcome. Not all comparisons measured recurrence rate, and the available evidence was based on low- to very low-quality evidence. No studies reported on participants' quality of life. Many studies had problems in the study design: it was often unclear how they decided which participants would receive which treatment or ensured that participants weren't aware of the treatment allocation. Many studies also did not use a placebo.
This review of randomised controlled trials included three trials in women giving birth vaginally. The trials were methodologically good and findings were consistent. One of these trials was a large study conducted across eight countries, involving over 23,000 women, another was conducted in several sites in France involving over 4000 women and one was a single centre trial in Uruguay involving nearly 200 women. CCT did not clearly reduce severe PPH (blood loss > 1000 mL) but resulted in a small reduction in PPH (blood loss > 500 mL) and mean blood loss. It did reduce the risk of having to manually remove the placenta. Its use should be recommended if the care provider has the skills to administer CCT safely.
 ,and the evidence is current to June 2018. Swallowing therapy comprises several different treatment types, and we looked at eight of these: acupuncture (11 studies), behavioural interventions (nine studies), drug therapy (three studies), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES; six studies), pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES; four studies), physical stimulation (three studies), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; two studies), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; nine studies). Swallowing therapy did not result in less death or disability among stroke survivors, nor did it lead to a safer swallow after treatment. However, some individual swallowing therapies seemed to reduce hospital length of stay, lessen the chance of getting a chest infection or pneumonia, or improve swallowing ability and recovery from swallowing problems. Many of the swallowing therapies involved different methods of delivery, so it is still not clear which approach is most effective for each type of therapy. The quality of the evidence was generally very low, low, or moderate. Additional high-quality studies are needed.
Study characteristics
In November 2017 we searched for clinical trials that used cannabis products to treat conditions with chronic neuropathic pain in adults. We found 16 studies involving 1750 people. Studies lasted 2 to 26 weeks. Studies compared different cannabis-based medicines. Ten studies compared an oromucosal (mouth) spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Two studies each compared inhaled herbal cannabis and cannabis plant-derived THC with placebo, and one study compared a man-made cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC (nabilone) with placebo. One study compared nabilone with a pain killer (dihydrocodeine). We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results.
There was no high-quality evidence.
All cannabis-based medicines pooled together were better than placebo for the outcomes substantial and moderate pain relief and global improvement. All cannabis-based medicines pooled together were better than placebo in reducing pain intensity, sleep problems and psychological distress (very low- to moderate-quality evidence).
There was no difference between all cannabis-based medicines pooled together and placebo in improving health-related quality of life, stopping the medication because it was not effective, and in the frequency of serious side effects (low-quality evidence).
More people reported sleepiness, dizziness and mental problems (e.g. confusion) with all cannabis-based medicines pooled together than with placebo (low-quality evidence). There was moderate-quality evidence that more people dropped out due to side effects with cannabis-based medicines than with placebo.
Herbal cannabis was not different from placebo in reducing pain and the number of people who dropped out due to side effects (very low-quality evidence).
This review found that patients with acute pancreatitis receiving enteral nutrition have fewer episodes of death, systemic infections, multiple organ failure and operative interventions. This data suggests that EN should be considered the standard of care for patients with acute pancreatitis requiring nutritional support.
We included 32 randomised controlled trials with 3370 participants. Of these, 25 studies with 2700 participants were exercise trials. Three studies with 242 participants were medication trials. One study with 53 participants was an education trial. Three studies with 375 participants were exercise plus education trials. Overall, the exercise and exercise plus education studies included people with mild to moderate PD. Twelve studies compared exercise with a control intervention not thought to reduce falls. Exercise probably reduces the number of falls by around 26%. Exercise probably slightly reduces the number of people experiencing one or more falls by around 10%.  Exercise may slightly improve health-related quality of life immediately after the exercise program. However, we are uncertain if it reduces the number of fall-related fractures, if it has an effect on the number of adverse events or if it is a cost-effective intervention for fall prevention.
Three studies compared a cholinesterase inhibitor (either rivastigmine or donepezil) with placebo medication (an inactive treatment) and found that this medication may reduce the rate of falls by around 50%. However, the effect of this medication on the number of people experiencing one or more falls, and on health-related quality of life was uncertain. Cholinesterase inhibitor medication may increase the number of non fall related adverse events by around 60%. There was no information about the cost-effectiveness of medication for fall prevention.
One study compared education alone and three studies compared exercise plus education with a control group. Exercise plus education may make little or no difference to the number of people experiencing one or more falls. However, we are uncertain of the effects of these interventions on the other fall and non-fall outcomes. All studies had high or unclear risk of bias in at least one area. This could have influenced how the studies were conducted and how the outcomes were assessed.
For the exercise interventions, the certainty of the evidence for the rate of falls and the number of people experiencing one or more falls was moderate. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low for all other outcomes.
For medication, the education and the exercise plus education interventions, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low for all outcomes.
We wanted to find out which medicines for asymptomatic carotid stenosis are best for preventing: damage to the brain, stroke, death, major bleeding, and progression of the carotid arteries' narrowing.
We also wanted to find out if these medicines make any difference to people's quality of life and whether they are associated with any unwanted or harmful effects. We searched for studies that compared one type of medicine with another type of medicine, placebo (an inactive medicine), or no treatment, in people of any age with asymptomatic carotid narrowing.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 34 studies that examined the medicines we were interested in. The studies involved a total of 11,571 people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. The participants' average age was 61 years (range = 18 to 100 years old), and nearly two-thirds of participants were male. The studies were carried out in outpatient medical settings around the world. The average follow-up period was under three years.
Of these 34 studies, only 22 assessed our outcomes of interest and were included in our analyses. These 22 studies involved a total of 6887 people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
None of the studies assessed participants for neurological (i.e. brain) damage, and none measured changes in people's quality of life.  Aspirin (1 study; 372 participants) may not prevent stroke, stroke-related death, progression of carotid narrowing, or increase side effects compared to placebo. We are very uncertain about the effect of aspirin on large bleeding events. It is uncertain if metoprolol (1 study, 793 participants) may prevent stroke or stroke-related death. However, chlorthalidone (1 study, 129 participants) may slow the progression of carotid narrowing compared to placebo. Neither study measured large bleeding events or side effects. It is uncertain whether warfarin (1 study, 919 participants) increases large bleeding events compared to placebo. However, it may lead to side effects compared to placebo. The study did not measure stroke, stroke-related death, or progression of carotid stenosis. It is unclear if cholesterol-lowering drugs prevent stroke (5 studies, 2235 participants), stroke-related death (2 studies, 1366 participants), or increase side effects (7 studies, 3726 participants) compared to placebo or no treatment. The studies did not measure large bleeding events or progression of carotid stenosis. We have limited confidence in the evidence for prevention of stroke, death, progression of carotid narrowing, side effects, and major bleeding events. Some studies had methodological problems or study designs that were not well reported. Overall, there is limited evidence to inform decision-making about the use of medicines for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.
We included 30 trials with 3933 participants (3882 in our data calculation) in this updated review. We found the overall quality of trials to be poor, with little information on how the experiments were carried out. The results were limited and the included trials were mostly small. In most trials, there was a high risk of misleading information. Thus, the results must be interpreted with caution. The evidence is up to date to 27 August 2015. Three of the 30 included trials reported receiving money from drug companies. In our review we could not identify a clear advantage of antithrombin for the objectives we examined, overall or among various types of patients or subgroups. In our investigation of bleeding events, however, we found an increased risk of bleeding for patients treated with antithrombin. Overall, there was a low quality of information from the studies regarding all of the results. We conclude that there is a need for a large-scale clinical trial with low risk of misleading information to investigate the advantages and harms of this drug among critically ill patients.
This systematic review evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of anxiety disorders. We found eleven randomised placebo-controlled trials, comparing quetiapine, olanzapine and risperidone with placebo and antidepressants. The vast majority of the available data was on quetiapine (> 3000 participants). Participants with generalised anxiety disorder responded significantly better to quetiapine than to placebo, measured as a reduction in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). Participants treated with quetiapine were more likely to drop out due to adverse events, to gain weight, to suffer from sedation or to suffer from extrapyramidal side effects. The evidence on the other second-generation antipsychotics is currently too limited to draw any conclusions.
We wanted to find out whether convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for people with confirmed COVID-19. We looked at:
• deaths from any cause after treatment with convalescent plasma;
• worsening of patients’ condition, measured by the number of people who needed support from a ventilator (a machine that helps people breathe if they cannot breathe on their own) or died; and improvement of patients’ condition, measured by participants discharged from hospital;
• quality of life; and
• unwanted effects. We searched for studies that investigated convalescent plasma to treat people with COVID-19. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and include people of any age, gender or ethnicity, with mild, moderate or severe COVID-19.
Where possible we pooled (added up) the studies’ results to analyse them. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 33 studies with 24,861 participants that investigated convalescent plasma. Among these, 29 studies included people with moderate to severe COVID-19 and four studies included people with mild COVID-19. Studies mainly took place in hospitals, in countries all over the world. The following findings apply to convalescent plasma compared with placebo (the same treatment but with no active ingredients) or standard care.  deaths from any causeat up to 28 days after treatment, about 225 in 1000 people died, compared to 220 in 1000 people who had been given convalescent plasma (21 studies, 19,021 people). needing invasive mechanical ventilation or dying. About 287 in 1000 people needed invasive mechanical ventilation support or died, compared to 296 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (6 studies, 14,477 people). It makes no difference toparticipants being discharged from hospital.About 665 in 1000 people were discharged from hospital, compared to 665 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (6 studies, 12,721 people). serious unwanted effects,about 118 in 1000 people may be at risk to have serious unwanted effects compared to 133 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (6 studies, 4901 people). quality of life(1 study, 483 people). • Convalescent plasma may result in no difference todeaths from any causeup to 28 days after treatment. About 22 in 1000 people given placebo or standard care died, compared to 9 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (2 studies, 536 people). admission to hospital or death within 28 daysafter treatment. About 112 in 1000 people given placebo or standard care were admitted to hospital or died, compared to 117 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (1 study, 376 people). time until COVID-19 symptoms resolved(1 study, 376 people). serious unwanted effects. • We are very confident in the evidence for deaths from any cause, and worsening and improvement of patients’ condition in people with moderate to severe COVID-19, as the results are consistent and are from many high-quality studies.
• Our confidence in the other evidence for people with moderate and severe, and mild COVID-19 is still limited, as we could not identify enough consistent results from a lot of studies.
• We still have little evidence on quality of life and for people with mild disease, and none for people without COVID-19 symptoms. This is the fifth version of our review. The evidence is up to date to 03 March 2022.
The 68 included studies covered a very wide range of disease areas, including antenatal care, cancer, home safety, hypertension, podiatry, smoking cessation and surgery. Primary, secondary and community care were included. The size of the studies ranged from 15 to 14,467 participants. Studies came from 12 countries; there was also one multinational study involving 19 countries. The USA and UK dominated with 25 and 22 studies, respectively. The next largest contribution came from Australia with eight studies. Our search updated our 2010 review and is current to February 2015. We also identified six studies published after 2015 outside the search. The review includes 24 mock trials where the researchers asked people about whether they would take part in an imaginary trial. We have not presented or discussed their results because it is hard to see how the findings relate to real trial decisions.
The present review looked at the available evidence for endovascular repair effectiveness compared with open surgery for ruptured aneurysms. We included four studies with a total of 868 participants. Risk of bias was generally low, but one study was at high risk of selection bias due to their use of the block method of randomisation; one study did not adequately report randomisation methods; and two studies may not have included a sufficient number of participants to adequately answer the questions posed by the studies. We found that from the data currently available there appears to be no difference in death within 30 days of the procedure between endovascular repair and open repair. Endoleaks were reported in 44 participants from three studies. The data on complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, combined cardiac complications, renal complications, spinal cord ischaemia, reoperation, amputation, and respiratory failure) are not robust enough at this point to make any strong conclusions on superiority of either repair technique, but emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (eEVAR) may be associated with a lower risk of bowel ischaemia. No robust conclusion can be made on outcomes at six months or one year. More studies are needed to better understand whether or not one of the aneurysm repair techniques, endovascular or open surgical, is superior based on patient outcomes. We found from the data available moderate-quality evidence suggesting there is no difference in 30-day mortality between eEVAR and open repair. Not enough information was provided for complications for us to make a well-informed conclusion, although it is possible that eEVAR is associated with a reduction in bowel ischaemia. We downgraded the quality of the evidence as some studies contained too few participants, not all studies reported on all complication outcomes, and the number of complications occurring between studies varied substantially.
This review of existing studies was carried out by Cochrane Oral Health authors and the evidence is current up to 3 May 2017. We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing different types of materials for prosthodontic treatment in people who were followed up for at least one year.
Of the nine included trials three were conducted in Germany, one in Sweden, one in Spain, one in Switzerland and the USA, one in Denmark, one in Italy, and one in Switzerland. All the included trials were single-centre conducted at university dental clinics and had a parallel-group study design. All the included trials received support from industry. The review included nine studies with 448 participants in which a total of 224 crowns and 132 bridges on natural teeth, and a total of 74 crowns and 25 bridges on implants were used. Each trial was addressing a different type of intervention. The studies had durations up to 10 years but included very small numbers of participants and were assessed as at unclear or high risk of bias. Based on these studies, there is currently insufficient reliable evidence to support which of these materials are more effective. Two trials were at unclear risk of bias and seven were at high risk of bias. The overall quality of evidence was very low, therefore caution should be exercised when generalising the results of the included trials. Future research should aim to provide more reliable information which can help clinicians to decide on appropriate materials for fixed prosthodontic treatment whilst taking into consideration the individual circumstances and preferences of their patients.
Our search identified one study for this review, including a total of 341 women. Of these, just 46 women met our inclusion criteria by having undergone previous continence surgery with a midurethral tape or colposuspension (a type of surgery used to support the tissues around the neck of the bladder with stitches). This review only focused on the results from these 46 women, extracted from the overall trial results. The one included study was funded by the Henry Smith Charity. A published correction indicated commercial support from the manufacturer of a device used in the study, which could be a source of bias. We wanted to assess the effects of conservative treatment (such as pelvic floor muscle training or bladder training), surgery and medication on the number of women who reported that their incontinence was improved or cured after treatment, along with other outcomes such as quality of life and adverse events. We were also interested in the effects on our outcomes of different types of midurethral tapes.
Of the 46 eligible women in the included study, two-thirds were reported to have received a midurethral tape in their first surgery. However, the data in the report did not differentiate between women who had previously undergone surgery with a midurethral tape and those who had had colposuspension. This means that we cannot be certain that the results were due to the midurethral tape, so we could not use the data in this review.
We planned to summarise evidence about which treatments might be considered worthwhile uses of healthcare resources but we did not identify any studies that asked this question. The lack of useable data means that we were unable to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. We did not find enough data to accurately assess the effects of any of the different management strategies for recurrent or persistent stress incontinence after failed midurethral tape surgery. Evidence from high-quality studies is required to address this area of uncertainty.
The orally-administered cytotoxic, hydroxyurea, may be given alongside radiotherapy for treating cervix cancer. Eight trials comparing concomitant hydroxyurea and radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone were assessed. They were not of sufficient quality to be able to pool the data. Although several trials reported an improvement in survival for patients receiving hydroxyurea, this conclusion was unreliable owing to methodological problems associated with trials including small sample size, a large number of patients excluded from analysis and questionable methods of analysis such as exclusion of treatment related deaths.
We searched for studies that compared biofeedback to either no treatment, sham treatment, or to other active treatments for IBS. We reviewed eight trials that included 300 total participants and assessed the effect of biofeedback on IBS. Each of these studies only included adults, and was carried out in an outpatient setting. The studies ranged from eight weeks to six months in length. The types of biofeedback devices varied, and included heart rate variability, measures of skin temperature or electrical resistance, and the tension of the muscles of the anus. None of the included trials disclosed funding sources. Our primary clinical outcomes were global clinical improvement and quality of life.
Regarding overall improvement, three trials compared biofeedback to no treatment and found that biofeedback as part of a relaxation training program led to better symptom control than no treatment (very low-certainty evidence). Two of these trials also compared biofeedback to an attention control and found minimal symptom improvement, but the effects of chance could not be ruled out because the evidence was of very low-certainty. One trial found a greater symptom benefit with heart rate biofeedback compared to hypnotherapy (low-certainty evidence). Of two trials comparing biofeedback to counseling, any apparent effect was minimal and the effect of chance could not be ruled out (very low-certainty evidence). When rectosigmoidal biofeedback was compared to relaxation control, the effect favored the relaxation control. The addition of biofeedback to standard medical therapy was superior to medical therapy alone and to medical therapy plus sham biofeedback (low-certainty evidence for both findings). A single trial looked specifically at overall quality of life. Quality of life improved both for those in the biofeedback group and those in the cognitive therapy group, but there was no overall difference between groups. Only one trial explicitly reported on adverse events. It reported no adverse events in either the biofeedback group or the cognitive therapy group. We used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence for each of these findings. These ranged from low to very low.
The evidence is current up to July 2019. We conclude that the existing data on biofeedback for IBS are limited and leave us uncertain about its value in IBS symptom management. The studies currently available all have design limitations that make the results difficult to apply to clinical settings. We do, however, recommend further study in this area, as biofeedback could represent a unique approach for a difficult to manage condition.
The review looked at various antibiotics being used during pregnancy to reduce these problems and to assess any adverse effects. Tetracyclines taken in pregnancy are known to be associated with teeth and bone abnormalities in babies, and some women find erythromycin unpleasant to take because of feeling sick and vomiting. The review found eleven trials, involving 1449 women, on erythromycin, amoxycillin, azithromycin and clindamycin, and the overall trial quality was good. However, all the trials assessed 'microbiological cure' (that is they looked for an eradication of the infection) and none assessed whether the eye or lung problems for the baby were reduced. Also, none of the trials were large enough to assess potential adverse outcomes adequately. The review found amoxycillin was an effective alternative to erythromycin but lack of long-term assessment of outcomes caused concern about its routine use in practice. If erythromycin is used, some women may stop taking it because of adverse effects. Azithromycin and clindamycin are potential alternatives. More research is needed.
We searched databases for randomised trials (studies where participants are allocated to one of two or more treatment groups in a random manner) evaluating the effectiveness of treatment including chemotherapy versus treatment not including chemotherapy (seven available studies) and on randomised studies evaluating the effectiveness of standard-dose radiotherapy without chemotherapy versus reduced-dose radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (one available study) in children (aged 0 to 21 years). The evidence is current to August 2013. Based on the evidence identified in this systematic review a benefit of chemotherapy cannot be excluded, but at this moment we are unable to draw a definitive conclusion to favour treatment with or without chemotherapy. Even though randomised studies are the highest level of evidence, it should be recognised that data from non-randomised studies were available, for example on the use of chemotherapy only in very young children. The results are promising for children without metastatic disease. For treatment with standard-dose radiotherapy without chemotherapy as compared with reduced-dose radiotherapy with chemotherapy, we also cannot make definitive recommendations. More high-quality research is needed.
We identified four studies for inclusion in the review. The studies lasted 8 weeks to 85 days and included a total of 743 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy. Clonidine (0.1% or 0.2%) was applied in gel form to the painful area two to three times daily, and was compared with placebo (dummy treatment) in three studies and with capsaicin applied to the skin in one study.
Limitations in how the studies were conducted and reported and the small amount of evidence available means that our confidence in the results is limited. The evidence suggests that in adults with painful diabetic neuropathy, topical clonidine may provide pain relief in some people. However, topical clonidine was not better than placebo for our other outcomes. We found no evidence of a difference between topical clonidine and capsaicin applied to the skin in painful diabetic neuropathy. The information from clinical trials is not enough to judge about possible long-term side effects of clonidine applied to the skin; however, we found that during 8 to 12 weeks of treatment there was no evidence of a difference in number of side effects between study groups. We also do not know from the included trials how clonidine works in other chronic neuropathic pain conditions. The review is current to 27 October 2021.
We included six studies, comprising 652 men altogether, that studied four different comparisons. The studies compared different forms of physical activity, alone or as part of a self-management programme, to watchful waiting (no specific intervention) or to alpha-blocker treatment.
Based on very low-quality evidence for the outcomes of symptom score for lower urinary tract symptoms, and stopping the treatment because of unwanted effects, we are uncertain whether physical activity interventions are helpful in men with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic obstruction. The quality of the evidence was very low, which means that the true effect may be substantially different from the findings of the review. Further research is very likely to change the results.
This review looked for evidence on how telerehabilitation interventions work in adults with MS. We searched widely for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), a particular kind of study where participants are placed in treatment groups by chance (that is, randomly) because in most settings these provide the highest quality evidence. We were interested in studies that compared a telerehabilitation programme with standard or minimal care, or with different kinds of rehabilitation programmes. We found nine relevant RCTs covering 531 participants (469 included in the analyses), evaluating a wide variety of telerehabilitation interventions in persons with MS. The telerehabilitation interventions evaluated were complex, with more than one rehabilitation component and included physical activity, educational, behavioural and symptom management programmes. These interventions had different purposes and used different technologies, so a single overall definite conclusion was not possible. The methodological quality of the included studies is low and varied among the studies. There was 'low-quality' evidence from the included RCTs to support the benefit of telerehabilitation in reducing short-term disability and managing symptoms such as fatigue in adults with MS. We found limited evidence to support the benefit of telerehabilitation interventions in improving disability, reducing symptoms and improving quality of life in the longer term. Furthermore, the interventions and outcomes being investigated in the included studies were different to each other. No studies reported any serious harm from telerehabilitation and there was no information on the associated costs.
There is a need for further research to assess the effects of the range of telerehabilitation techniques and to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of these interventions in people with MS. The evidence in this review is up to date to July 2014.
To assess the effects of isoflavones for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, we examined five randomized controlled trials of isoflavones or soy protein containing isoflavones. The trials lasted three to six months and involved 208 participants. There were no outcome data on death from any cause, cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke, morbidity, complications, health-related quality of life and costs. Two trials reported adverse effects, including gastrointestinal discomfort (bloating and constipation) and an increased number of hot flushes. They observed no serious adverse events. In our included studies, we found no cholesterol-lowering effect of isoflavones. However, the quality of the included trials had some considerable limitations and the number of the participants was low. Further higher-quality and rigorously performed studies on patient-important outcome measures such as cardiovascular diseases and health-related quality of life are required.
We found 35 studies with a combined total of 3632 participants (searched to 16 March 2021). Some studies compared one treatment on one leg to another treatment on the other leg. Studies used a variety of different treatments and none of them reported on all of our outcomes. Not all available treatments were investigated: no studies investigated intensive pulsed light, thermocoagulation or microphlebectomy.
Sclerosing agents improved telangiectasias and reticular veins resolution when compared to sham treatment, but resulted in more unwanted side effects (hyperpigmentation and matting). There was no benefit seen in one sclerosing agent compared to another, or compared to laser, for improving telangiectasias. There may be differences between treatments in adverse events and pain. Compared to other agents, polidocanol may result in less pain. Sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STS) may cause more hyperpigmentation, matting and probably more pain; foam may result in more matting; laser treatment may cause less hyperpigmentation. Combined laser plus sclerotherapy may result in better resolution compared to only sclerotherapy, but may cause more pain. We are not very confident in these results. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by one or two levels (from high to moderate or low). This was because of the differences in the designs of the studies, which meant that only small numbers of studies and participants provided information for each treatment comparison. Further well-designed studies are needed to improve our confidence in the comparisons identified in this review, for other treatments available, and for other important outcomes, such as recurrence, time to resolution and long-term side effects.
We included 10 randomised trials involving 9090 women and their babies in this review. These trials were of a low to moderate quality overall. No difference in the risk of perinatal mortality (stillbirth and death of babies prior to hospital discharge) was found when we compared the group of babies born to mothers who received magnesium during their pregnancy and the group of babies born to mothers who did not receive magnesium. Magnesium supplementation did not reduce the risk of babies being born small for their gestational age, and did not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia for the mothers.
We found no convincing evidence that magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial.
In contrast to the previous version of this review, this update now includes data from one large and six small randomised controlled trials. It allows more definitive conclusions about the potential beneficial or harmful clinical effects of IABP support beyond its immediate haemodynamic effects. Complications such as moderate and severe bleeding were more frequently observed in patients treated with more invasive devices than IABP. Small randomised trials suffered from inadequate power to address deaths and harmful effects of IABP and were biased by frequent cross-over to the more aggressive strategy, early stopping of the trial, or the inclusion of patients with IABP at randomisation. It is most noteworthy that a recently conducted and published large randomised trial showed no evidence for survival benefits of IABP support in patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). On the basis of these data, IABP support is no longer strongly recommended by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for treatment of patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock. Rather, IABP use is based on the personal experience and decision of the physician and the particular circumstances of individual patients.
Randomised, controlled trials are needed to confirm this need as well as its proper dosage and frequency of use. We performed a systematic review of randomised control trials investigating the impact of the use, dosage, and distribution of protein substitute on physical and neuropsychological outcomes in the treatment of PKU. Trials of children and adults diagnosed with PKU in the newborn period who were treated early and continuously were included. We planned to pool the results of the trials to estimate treatment effect. Three trials met the inclusion criteria for the review. One trial evaluated the impact of protein substitute versus no protein substitute on neuropsychological status, plasma amino acid concentrations, and nutrient intake. The remaining two trials investigated the impact of differing dosages of protein substitute on plasma amino acid concentrations and nutrient intake. No trials investigating daily protein substitute distribution were eligible for inclusion in the review. Results are presented in text form only since adequate information for data pooling was not provided. The investigators will be contacted for further information. Currently data are insufficient to reach any conclusions regarding the use, dosage, and distribution of protein substitute in the treatment of PKU. Further randomized or controlled clinical trials are needed to provide evidence for the effectiveness, dosage, and distribution of protein substitute in the treatment of PKU.
There are no trials included in the review. There is one ongoing trial which may, in the future, be eligible for inclusion. There are currently no randomized controlled trials assessing the benefits and risks; the most appropriate source of stem cells; or the most eligible participants (those who have experience severe complication or those who have not) of the procedure in people with sickle cell disease.
Forty-nine trials met the inclusion criteria. Six trials involving 497 participants were included to study efficacy, and compared acetylcysteine or carbocysteine to placebo. Thirty-four trials (including the previous six) were eligible to study safety and involved 2064 paediatric patients.
The results of this review suggest actual but limited efficacy of acetylcysteine and carbocysteine (e.g. reduction of cough at day seven) and good overall safety (except for rare mild gastrointestinal side effects) among children older than two years of age. However, the number of participants included was limited and the methodological quality was questionable. These results should also take into consideration the fact that acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are prescribed for self limiting diseases (for example, acute cough, bronchitis). In children younger than two years, and given strong concerns about safety (increased instead of decreased bronchial secretions), these drugs should only be used for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in the context of a randomised controlled trial.
In this review we included all studies that compared three-day therapy with longer treatment (five days or more). Three days of treatment were adequate to achieve symptomatic relief for most patients, but it appears that longer therapy is better in terms of bacteria elimination from the urine, no matter what antibiotic is used. Longer therapy for UTI is related to higher rate of adverse reactions to the antibiotics used. Pending further research, it could be considered for women in whom eradication of bacteria in the urine is important.
We included only three studies, which had a total of 98 participants with ILD. All three studies compared the effects of both oxygen and air in all participants while they did an exercise test, while preventing them from knowing which treatment they were being given. Two studies showed no helpful effects on the ability to exercise or on symptoms of breathlessness. One study showed that participants could exercise for longer with oxygen. None of these studies looked at the effect of oxygen on quality of life, survival, the cost of oxygen treatment or its effects on hospital admissions. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies.
We also looked for studies of oxygen given after exercise in people with ILD ("short burst oxygen"), but did not find any studies. There were some problems with the way these studies were conducted. The included studies were small. Also, two studies did not make sure that the amount of oxygen given was enough to prevent a drop in oxygen levels when the participants were exercising. This could mean that they were not given enough oxygen. The overall quality of evidence in this review was low. We cannot tell from these studies if ambulatory oxygen is helpful in people with ILD. More research is needed, which should look at the effect of ambulatory oxygen on exercise, breathlessness and also on quality of life in people with ILD.
This review focuses on chronic blepharitis and stratifies anterior and posterior blepharitis. There were 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis) included in the review, 20 of which included participants with anterior blepharitis and 14 of which included participants with posterior blepharitis. For anterior blepharitis, topical antibiotics provided some symptomatic relief and were effective in clearing bacteria from the eyelid margins. There was no difference between the types of topical antibiotics used. Topical steroids also provided some symptomatic relief; however, they were ineffective in eliminating bacteria. Lid hygiene, including warm compresses and lid scrubs, showed some symptomatic relief in both anterior and posterior blepharitis. Overall, there was no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. Further research should be done to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for blepharitis, with particular attention paid to adequate diagnosis and classification of the disease.
We wanted to find out if non-medicine-based treatments help people with PPA improve their word-finding ability (ability to find the right word for the right object or situation), overall language abilities, cognition (thinking ability), and quality of life. We also wanted to find out if brain stimulation had any negative effects, such as causing pain or dizziness. We searched for studies that compared non-medicine-based treatment to another non-medicine-based treatment or a control group (a group that received no treatment or a placebo – a 'dummy' or 'sham' treatment).
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study size, methods, and how well details of the treatments were reported. We found 10 studies involving a total of 132 people. The studies were small, ranging from 3 to 40 participants. The average age of the people in the studies was around 68 years. The studies investigated the following treatments: 
• tDCS alone (2 studies); 
• tDCS plus some form of language training (7 studies); 
• repetitive TMS alone (1 study).
The interventions varied greatly in treatment type, duration, frequency, and in the specifics of the brain stimulation technique. This meant we considered each study's results individually, rather than combining and analysing the information from several studies. We found that tDCS plus language training may be helpful for improving word finding, especially for "trained words" - that is, words that participants had practiced finding during the study. Even though the results varied between studies, our review suggests that the combination of language therapy and tDCS may be suitable to improve language functions in PPA.
Three studies assessed how the treatments affected people's overall language abilities; the results were inconclusive.
Only 1 study or no studies assessed some of our outcomes of interest, including cognition (1 study) and quality of life (1 study). The latter showed an improvement in people's quality of life, but we have little confidence in this result because it is based on a single study. We have very little confidence in the current evidence, mainly because of problems in how the studies were carried out and the small number of people studied. The evidence is current to January 2024.
Aerobic exercise is physical activity that stimulates a person's breathing and blood circulation. The review of 14 trials, involving 1014 pregnant women, found that pregnant women who engage in vigorous exercise at least two to three times per week improve (or maintain) their physical fitness, and there is some evidence that these women have pregnancies of the same duration as those who maintain their usual activities. There is too little evidence from trials to show whether there are other effects on the woman and her baby. The trials reviewed included non-contact exercise such as swimming, static cycling and general floor exercise programs. Most of the trials were small and of insufficient methodologic quality, and larger, better trials are needed before confident recommendations can be made about the benefits and risks of aerobic exercise in pregnancy.
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing exercise to no exercise or other treatments in adults with MS. The evidence is current to October 2014. We found 45 trials, involving 2250 people with MS, assessing the effect of exercise therapy using self reported fatigue. We used 36 studies, involving 1603 people with MS, in an analysis. Combined, these 36 trials supported the idea that exercise therapy may be a promising treatment to reduce fatigue without side events. This finding seems especially true for endurance training, mixed training (i.e. muscle power training mixed with endurance training), or 'other' training (e.g. yoga, tai-chi). To assess the safety of exercise therapy we counted the number of reported MS relapses in the people receiving exercise therapy and in people in a non-exercise group and did not find a significant difference. Even though these results are promising, it is worth noting some methods used in the trials may have affected the reliability of the results. For example, most trials included a low number of participants and did not primarily aim to reduce fatigue (but, for instance, aimed to improve walking capability) with the assessment of fatigue being a secondary measure. However, in contrast, exercise therapy may also be less feasible for people with MS who are severely fatigued. In addition, the reporting and definition of MS relapses was in general poor, and lacked consistency. Future, high-quality research is warranted to elucidate the feasibility, effects, and working mechanisms of exercise therapy. Future studies may benefit from a uniform definition of fatigue, and subsequently be designed to measure fatigue specifically.
We found 22 research studies involving 695 participants, which reported on the efficacy of interventions related to theory of mind. The evidence is current to 7th August 2013. Despite all studies using a high-quality basic methodology (the randomised controlled trial), there was concern over poor study design and reporting in some aspects. While there is some evidence that theory of mind, or related skills, can be taught to people with ASD, there is currently poor quality  evidence that these skills can be maintained, generalised to other settings, or that teaching theory of mind has an impact on developmentally-linked abilities. For example, it was rare for a taught skill to generalise to a new context, such as sharing attention with a new adult who was not the therapist during the intervention. New skills were not necessarily maintained over time. This evidence could imply that the theory of mind model has little relevance for educational and clinical practice in ASD. Further research using longitudinal methods, better outcome measures, and higher standards of reporting is needed to throw light on the issues. This is particularly important as the specific details of the theory of mind model continue to evolve.
The review found that treatment with GSF increases white cell counts and reduces the risk of infection in people receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma. However, GSF treatment did not improve survival. More research is needed to improve GSF treatments.
We included two trials for a total of 155 very preterm newborn infants comparing low-dose heparin with the same solution without heparin. The use of heparin does not reduce the risks of bleeding in the brain, mortality or any other relevant outcomes in very preterm neonates when compared to solution without heparin. The results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of heparin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question.
the searches were updated to March 2018. We found no randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) for inclusion, so there is an absence of evidence that tranexamic acid, vaginal packing (with or without formalin-soaked packs), interventional radiology techniques or other interventions are as effective or safe as radiotherapy for palliative control of bleeding from the vagina in advanced cervical cancer. There is a need for randomised controlled trials or good-quality non-randomised comparative studies to determine the effectiveness and safety of these interventions when compared with radiotherapy in terms of symptom control, quality of life and side events. no studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and so there is no good-certainty evidence.
The blood count measures the amount of haemoglobin in the blood. Haemoglobin is a protein that gives blood its red colour and carries oxygen around the body. A normal blood count is around 12 grams a decilitre (12 g/dL). We wanted to find out if it is safe to withhold blood transfusion until the blood count drops to between 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL, rather than transfusing sooner at higher blood counts of between 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL. We examined the results of studies that allocated patients to one of two groups by chance (for example, by flipping a coin). In one group, the patients only received blood transfusions if their blood count fell below a higher threshold (typically, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). In the other group, the patients only received blood transfusions if their blood counts fell below a lower threshold (typically, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL). We found 48 studies that involved 21,433 patients. The patients had been hospitalised for a range of reasons including: bone (orthopaedic), heart (cardiac) or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (for example, through bleeding in the stomach or intestines); heart diseases; cancer and blood cancers. The studies compared higher or lower blood count thresholds for blood transfusion. (The ‘threshold’ is the blood count level that would need to be met before a transfusion would be given.)
Transfusion
We found that patients who received transfusions only at lower blood count thresholds were 41% less likely to receive a blood transfusion than those who received them only at higher blood count thresholds. If the lower threshold were applied routinely by medical staff, it would lead to a substantial reduction in the quantity of blood needed.
Death and harmful events
There was no clear difference in the risk of dying within 30 days of receiving, or not receiving, a transfusion for patients in the two different threshold groups.
There was also no clear difference between the low and high threshold groups for the number of serious harmful events that occurred after patients received, or did not receive, blood transfusions. The harmful events recorded included infection (pneumonia, wound infection, and blood poisoning), heart attacks, strokes, and problems with blood clots. We found that most of the studies provided a high quality of evidence; they were adequately conducted and used methods that minimised biases that could make the validity of the results uncertain.
We are confident in the evidence regarding likelihood of receiving a transfusion, death within 30 days of transfusion, heart attack, stroke and infection. We are moderately confident in the evidence for problems caused by blood clots, but too few occurred in either group for us to be more confident.
Too few studies evaluated quality of life for us to be able to see whether it varied between groups. This Cochrane Review updates our previous work on this subject (last published in 2016). Seventeen new studies are included. The evidence is up to date to November 2020.
Depression and anxiety are common in people with dementia and MCI, but the best way to treat them is unclear. Medicines often used to treat these problems may not be effective for people with dementia and may cause side effects, so many guidelines recommend trying psychological treatments first. We were interested in psychological therapies that aim to reduce symptoms of anxiety or depression or to improve the emotional well-being of people with dementia or MCI. There are a variety of different types of psychological treatment. We wanted to find out how effective each treatment is for symptoms of depression and anxiety in people with dementia or MCI. We also wanted to find out about effects on quality of life, ability to manage daily activities and thinking skills, and to know if the treatments had any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared a psychological treatment to usual care, or to usual care plus a treatment that was not a specific psychological treatment.
We divided the psychological treatments into several broad categories based on the theory behind them and the content of the treatment sessions, and we looked at each category separately. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 29 studies that included 2599 people with dementia or MCI. Most of the evidence we found was about treatments based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT, which aims to alter thoughts and behaviours) and treatments aimed at supporting well-being, which we called counselling and supportive therapies. We also found a very small number of studies about mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and interpersonal therapy. The majority of studies looked at the effect on depression, but very few studies had anxiety as an outcome.
The evidence we found suggests that:
- CBT-based treatments probably improve symptoms of depression, quality of life and ability to manage daily activities at the end of the treatment period in people with dementia or MCI, although the effects were small. We could not be sure about any effect on anxiety. There was some evidence that the effect on depression might depend on how severe the symptoms of depression were before the start of treatment, whether people had a diagnosis of dementia or MCI and what type of treatment was used, but more research would be needed to be sure about this.
- Supportive and counselling treatments may have no effect on symptoms of depression at the end of treatment and there was not enough evidence for us to know if there was any effect on anxiety.
- We cannot be sure about the effect of mindfulness-based therapies or interpersonal therapy because there were very few studies of these treatments.
There was limited information about unwanted effects associated with any of the treatments.
We also found 14 ongoing studies, so we can expect more evidence about our question to become available in the next few years. We could be moderately certain about the small positive effects of CBT-based treatments on depression, quality of life and daily activities, but were less certain about other results. Most people in the review had dementia of mild to moderate severity so the results may not apply to people with MCI or more severe dementia. Very few studies included only people who had significant levels of depression before treatment, although these are the people most likely to be offered treatment in practice. There is not yet enough evidence to be able to say which people are most likely to benefit from which psychological treatments. This review is up to date to February 2021.
Six studies, published between 2006 and 2014, were included in this review, comprising a total of 5152 participants suffering from RRMS. The treatment duration was six months in three studies, 12 months in one study, and 24 months in two studies. The main conclusion of this review was that fingolimod, administered as monotherapy at the approved dose of 0.5 mg once-daily increases the probability of being relapse-free at 24 months compared to placebo. The benefit was confirmed with disease activity measures defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However, there was no effect on preventing disability worsening; treatment was not associated with an increased risk of patient withdrawals due to adverse events.
Comparing the same dose of fingolimod to intramuscular interferon beta-1a, the drug at one year slightly increased the number of participants free from relapse or from inflammatory enhancing lesions and decreased the relapse rate. Again, we did not detect any advantage for preventing disability progression. We found a greater likelihood of discontinuation due to adverse events in the short-term (six months) for fingolimod as compared to immunomodulating drugs, and no significant difference compared to interferon beta at 12 months.
The duration of all studies was equal or inferior to 24 months, so that the efficacy (but mostly the safety) of fingolimod over 24 months remains uncertain. This is a key point for a lifetime disease with the probability of chronic treatments as in MS.
The risk of adverse events requires careful monitoring of patients over time and suggests the need for studies with longer follow-up, particularly considering the recent warning on the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
The six studies included in this review were sponsored by Novartis Pharma, and most co-authors of the published papers were affiliated to the pharmaceutical company; this is recognised as a potential source of bias.
We wanted to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of antidepressants for treating depressive symptoms in people with cancer at any site of the body and severity. We searched medical databases for well-designed clinical studies comparing antidepressants versus placebo, or antidepressants versus other antidepressants in adults with a diagnosis of cancer and depression. We reviewed 14 studies assessing the effectiveness of antidepressants in 1364 participants. We found that antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms after six to 12 weeks of treatment in people with cancer. There was not enough evidence to determine how well antidepressants were tolerated in comparison with placebo. The results did not show whether any particular antidepressant was better than any other antidepressant in terms of beneficial or harmful effects. Our certainty in the evidence was very low because of a lack of information about how the studies were designed, low numbers of people in the analysis of results, and differences between the characteristics of the studies and their results. Despite the impact of depression on people with cancer, the available studies were very few and of low quality. We observed a small potential beneficial effect of antidepressants in treating depressive symptoms in people with cancer. However, this finding was supported by very low-quality evidence. To better inform doctors and patients, we need larger studies that randomly assign people to different treatments. Currently, it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the effects of antidepressants on depression in people with cancer. Our review seems to indicate that people with cancer should be treated in a similar way to the general population for the management of depressive symptoms. The evidence is current to November 2022.
This review includes 23 trials, with 1586 participants. The trials compared quinine or quinine-based medicines against inactive treatment (placebo) or other active treatments. We found no new studies when we searched the medical literature again and updated the review in 2014. The risk of bias in the included trials varied considerably. All 23 trials claimed to be randomised, but many failed to clearly describe how participants were assigned to treatments. There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but no increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death.
Low or moderate quality evidence shows there is no significant difference when comparing quinine to vitamin E or to a quinine-vitamin E mixture. There is evidence from one trial that theophylline combined with quinine improves cramps more than quinine alone. In a single trial there was no significant difference when comparing quinine to xylocaine injections.
More research is needed to clarify the best dose and duration of treatment, as well as alternatives to quinine for cramps.
The evidence is current to October 2014.
We included 33 well-designed studies with a total of 2293 children in which ultrasound guidance was compared with another method of nerve localization (traditional landmarks techniques or nerve stimulator) for regional blockade in children. Sources of funding included a government organization (two studies), a charitable organization (two studies), and an institutional department (13 studies). Two studies declared that they received industry help (equipment loan). The source of funding was unclear for 14 studies. Ultrasound guidance for regional blockade in children may decrease the occurrence of failed block. It may also increase duration of the block and reduce pain at one hour after surgery. Ultrasound guidance may decrease the number of needle passes required to perform the block. However, because the vast majority of blocks in children are performed with the child under deep sedation or general anaesthesia, the true value of this finding might be arguable. There were no major complications in the included trials. There may be little or no difference between study groups in risks of minor complications. Altogether, whether or not these findings justify the extra cost of ultrasound guidance should probably also take into account the anaesthesiologist's expertise and local resources. The five ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once published and assessed. We assessed the quality of the evidence as moderate for decreased occurrence of a failed block and improved pain scores at one hour; high for prolonged block duration; and very low for decreased number of needle passes.
We identified 38 studies and came to the conclusion that misoprostol is the drug of choice for medical pregnancy termination, preferably in combination with mifepristone which facilitates the effectiveness of misoprostol. Misoprostol works best when it is administered into the vagina. Women who had previously given birth could take misoprostol by mouth (under the tongue). Irrespective of the medication used for second trimester termination there is a considerable risk of surgical intervention because of vaginal bleeding or incomplete abortion.
This review has shown that regular use for at least seven days of inhaled beta-2 medicines that relieve airways obstruction and can also improve the symptoms associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in most patients but not all. Patients are far more likely to prefer treatment with these type of medicines than with placebo, and less likely to fail or drop-out from treatment when treated with such medicines. Regular treatment with such inhaled medicines should be reserved for those patients who report symptomatic and clinical benefit from their use. Newer, long acting bronchodilators are currently available, and they may be more practical and/or effective in these patients. However, this review indicates that these older inexpensive drugs are effective in the treatment of COPD.
We found 39 clinical trials involving 1897 children and 729 adults. Thirty-three of the trials were conducted in an emergency room (or emergency department) and community settings (such as a GP's surgery), and six trials were on inpatients (people in hospital) with acute asthma (207 children and 28 adults). Overall we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate. Taking beta-agonists through either a spacer or a nebuliser in the emergency department did not make a difference to the number of adults being admitted to hospital, whilst in children we can be fairly confident that nebulisers are not better than spacers at preventing admissions.
In children, the length of stay in the emergency department was significantly shorter when the spacer was used instead of a nebuliser. The average stay in the emergency department for children given nebulised treatment was 103 minutes. Children given treatment via spacers spent an average of 33 minutes less.
In adults, the length of stay in the emergency department was similar for the two delivery methods. However the adult studies were conducted slightly differently which may have made it more difficult to show a difference in the length of stay in the emergency department. Because all the adult studies used a so-called "double-dummy" design, the adults received a spacer AND a nebuliser (either beta-agonist in a spacer and a dummy nebuliser or vice versa) which meant both groups of people were in the emergency department for as long as it took to take both treatments.
Lung function tests were also similar for the two delivery methods in both adults and children. Pulse rate was lower in children taking beta-agonists through a spacer (mean difference -5% baseline), and there was a lower risk of developing tremor. Metered-dose inhalers with a spacer can perform at least as well as wet nebulisation in delivering beta₂-agonists in children with acute asthma, but we are less certain about the results in adults.
The review is current as of February 2013.
Following our data search in January 2018, we included 10 trials with a total of 844 participants, which we assessed using the standard Cochrane Review protocol. The trials compared the incidence of hernia development around a stoma between a group having a mesh placement at the time of stoma formation and a control group having a conventional stoma formation without mesh placement. We found that mesh placement around the stoma at the time of stoma formation reduces the incidence of future hernia formation. The participants having a mesh fitted had a similar level of complications as those not having a mesh. We found low-quality evidence favouring the insertion of a mesh into people having a stoma.
We searched for studies in September 2019 and identified 15 studies involving 924 participants. The studies used three main types of interventions, including programmes designed to increase physical activity, aerobic fitness and health-related quality of life and compared physical activity intervention and control interventions in people with congenital heart disease.
Key results
We included 15 trials with 924 participants. Half of the participants were female. Of the 15 trials, 5 used a total of 500 young people (less than 18 years of age) and 10 trials used a total of 424 adult participants. We found that physical fitness and physical activity may slightly increase but we are very uncertain about quality of life. There is currently no data to say if this small increase in fitness will result in fewer visits to the hospital. But there were no recorded deaths or serious events that were related to participation in physical activity.
Quality of evidence
Using a validated scientific approach (GRADE), the certainty in the evidence base was moderate for fitness, low for physical activity and very low for quality of life. Most outcomes were limited due to small study participant numbers and poor reporting of study details.
We found ten studies with 1592 people to include in the review. On average, the studies lasted only 12 weeks, although one study ran for nine months. Each of them used a set of formal criteria to diagnose both depression and dementia and compared an antidepressant against a dummy pill (placebo).
The older studies used more old-fashioned antidepressants (imipramine, clomipramine, and moclobemide) and the newer studies used more modern ones, such as venlafaxine, mirtazapine and so-called SSRI antidepressants (sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram and escitalopram).
The people taking part in the studies had an average age of 75 and they had mild or moderate dementia. With the exception of two studies, they were being treated as outpatients. We found that there was little or no difference in scores on depression rating scales between people treated with antidepressants and those treated with placebo for 12 weeks. The evidence to support this finding was of high quality, which suggests that further research is unlikely to find a different result. There was probably also little or no difference after six to nine months of treatment.
Another way to assess the effect of antidepressants is to count the number of people in the antidepressant and placebo groups who show significant clinical improvement (response) or who recover from depression (remission). There was low-quality evidence on the number of people showing a significant clinical improvement and the result was imprecise so we were unable to be sure of any effect on this measure. People taking an antidepressant were probably more likely to recover from depression than were those taking placebo (antidepressant: 40%, placebo: 21.7%). There was moderate-quality evidence for this finding, so it is possible that further research could find a different result.
We found that antidepressants did not affect the ability to manage daily activities and probably had little or no effect on a test of cognitive function (which includes attention, memory, and language).
People taking an antidepressant were probably more likely to drop out of treatment and to have at least one unwanted side effect. The quality of the evidence varied, mainly due to poorly conducted studies and problems with the relevance of the outcome measures used. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting the different results on depression rating scales and recovery rates, as evidence was of a higher quality for the former than for the latter.
Another major problem is that side effects are very rarely well-reported in studies.
Therefore, further research will still be useful to reach conclusions that are more reliable and can better help doctors and patients to know what works for whom.
We included 29 studies in our analysis. The studies covered a broad range of countries in Africa, South-East Asia, and South America, although most were conducted in India. These studies primarily explored the views and experiences of community members and those distributing the medicines in low-income countries where lymphatic filariasis is considered a problem. From the data, four themes emerged.
People weigh up benefits and harms before participating. People understand they can reduce the suffering, stigma and costs of developing the disease (high confidence); however, these benefits do not always mesh with their experiences (high confidence). In particular, side effects are frightening and unwelcome (high confidence); and these effects are amplified through rumour and social media (moderate confidence).
Many people are suspicious of MDA programmes. When people lack a detailed explanation for the programme and their experiences of it, they often develop explanations based on the historical backdrop and level of trust people have in relevant authority figures (high confidence), although some have unwavering faith in their government and by extension the programme (moderate confidence).
Programmes expect compliance, and this can become coercive and blaming. Health workers and community members stigmatize non-compliance, which can become coercive (moderate confidence), so communities may appear to comply publicly, but privately reject treatment (moderate confidence).
Community distributors are often not respected or valued. They have little authority (moderate confidence), and the behaviour of some damages the MDA programme's reputation (high confidence). Communities want information about programmes to help make decisions about participation, but drug distributors are not sufficiently informed, or skilled in this communication (high confidence).
We were unable to assess the impact of programme design on communities' perception of the programme and decision to adhere as these aspects were too similar across all studies. We searched for studies published before 8 April 2021.
Only three short-term studies (lasting eight weeks) that randomised people with schizophrenia to either receive sessions of yoga as a package of care or standard care could be included in this review. Yoga was combined with drama, music and dance in one study, with a motivational and feedback session in another study. The final study included in this review combined yoga with counselling and an interactive question and answer session.The relative contribution of yoga was not clearly outlined in these studies. We found these studies by electronic searching of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register in March 2017. All participants continued to receive their prescribed antipsychotic treatment during their trial. Many important outcomes were not addressed by the studies in this review, including mental, physical and social functioning, adverse effects and economic considerations. There may have been some small changes in quality of life in favour of the yoga package but overall there was not enough good-quality evidence in this review to make any robust claims that yoga as a package of care should be prescribed as an add-on to standard care for schizophrenia. Evidence was limited and weak. The number of included studies was small, and only short-term follow-up for two outcomes were reported. Schizophrenia often is a long-term illness and more, larger, and long-term trials that focus on important outcomes are necessary.
This review included three trials that randomly assigned 175 women with the placenta remaining undelivered more than 15 minutes after delivery to either a placebo or the tocolytic nitroglycerin. Both groups received oxytocin to stimulate contractions of the uterus. Combined administration of nitroglycerin and oxytocin did not reduce the need for manual removal of placenta, blood loss, nor the incidence of severe postpartum haemorrhage. Nitroglycerin administration did not cause headache but resulted in a mild drop in blood pressure and a related increase in heart rate. Two out of the three trials had low risk of bias but this result needs confirmation in larger trials with adequate sample sizes to verify the role of nitroglycerin and other tocolytic drugs in managing different subtypes of retained placenta. The trials in this review did not specify the type of retained placenta. We have included an explanation of some of the scientific terms that are used in this review in a glossary (see Appendix 1).
We included studies reporting results in patients with early to severe knee OA (Kellgren & Lawrence grade I-IV) treated with a knee brace (valgus knee brace, neutral brace, neoprene sleeve) or an orthosis (laterally or medially wedged insole, neutral insole, variable or constant stiffness shoe) or given no treatment. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage that protects the ends of bones breaks down, causing pain and swelling. Osteoarthritis can occur in different areas of the knee or can affect the whole knee. Depending on the area, osteoarthritis can change the alignment of joints.
Braces and orthoses are devices that you wear to support your knee joint. Orthoses are insoles that fit comfortably inside your shoes. Braces are made of combinations of metal, foam, plastic, elastic material and straps. A knee brace can be fitted specially for the person wearing it. This review shows the following in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. • may result in little or no difference in reducing pain and improving knee function and quality of life after 12 months (low-quality evidence); and
• causes many patients to stop their initial treatment because of lack of effect in both groups.
Stiffness and treatment failure (need for surgery) were not reported. • may result in little or no difference in reducing pain (low-quality evidence).
Function, stiffness, health-related quality of life, treatment failure and side effects were not reported. • probably results in little or no difference in reducing pain and improving function, stiffness and quality of life after 12 months (moderate-quality evidence).

Treatment failure and side effects were not reported. • may result in little or no difference in reducing pain and improving function after sx months (low-quality evidence).

Stiffness, health-related quality of life, treatment failure and side effects were not reported
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. Side effects may include pain in the back of the knee, low back pain, foot sole pain or skin irritation. • Low-quality evidence suggests that people with OA who use a knee brace may have little or no reduction in pain, improved knee function and improved quality of life.
• Moderate-quality evidence suggests that people with OA of the knee who wear laterally wedged insoles or neutral insoles probably have little or no improvement in pain, function and stiffness.
From our systematic search we identified two trials. One trial compared surgery to remove the first rib (transaxillary first rib resection) with surgery in which the surgeon freed the nerves from surrounding tissues (neuroplasty) without removing a rib, in 55 people with the disputed type of TOS. The participants had not responded to non-surgical treatments. Average follow-up was 37 months. A second trial analyzed 19 people who underwent double-blinded provision of a single injection of BTX (muscle relaxant) into the scalene muscles of the neck, and 18 people in the placebo group who received no active injection, with follow-up at six weeks, three months and, critically for the purpose of this review, six months. There is very low quality evidence that removal of a rib reduced pain from 'disputed' TOS more than a neuroplasty procedure. We identified issues in study design that could have affected the outcome of the trial. There were no adverse effects in either group. There were no trials of surgery versus no treatment. The trial comparing the intervention of BTX injection with placebo provided moderate evidence that this procedure does not significantly reduce pain or disability scores long term, although there were no adverse events associated with the procedure over placebo.
This systematic review demonstrated that there is not enough evidence that the established interventions for TOS are helpful in relieving pain. Until high quality, randomized clinical trials comparing the various interventions for TOS are performed, the decision whether to treat and the choice of appropriate treatment will have to be based on the preferences of the individual and health care provider.
The evidence is current to June 2014.
We wanted to find out whether healthy older adults who receive the herpes zoster virus vaccine are less likely to develop this disease compared to healthy older adults who receive a 'fake vaccine' (i.e. a placebo, which is an injection that does not cause any effect related to herpes zoster). We also wanted to know if the vaccine, compared to the fake vaccine, caused any undesirable effects. We looked for studies that investigated and compared healthy older adults (mean age of participants 60 years and older) who received the vaccine to protect against herpes zoster, to healthy older adults who received the fake vaccine.
We compared and summarised the findings, and assessed our confidence in the evidence based on study size, on how the data were presented, and on the risks of bias (the likelihood that features of the study design or conduct of the study will lead to wrong results). This is an update of the systematic review, and we found two new studies, bringing the total to 26 included studies (90,259 participants). These studies tested two types of vaccines that have already been approved for use. Sixteen studies tested the live attenuated virus vaccine (LZV) and included 55,975 participants (single dose); 10 studies tested the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), and included 34,284 participants (two doses with one two-month interval between them).
All studies involved people who were outpatients. Most study participants were Caucasian (White race).  LZV (single dose)
The participants who received LZV had a lower rate of shingles compared to those who received the fake vaccine. Therefore, LZV is probably effective since the certainty of the evidence was moderate. It would be necessary to vaccinate 50 healthy older adults with LVZ to prevent one episode of shingles.
RZV (two doses)
Vaccination with RZV is also probably effective (moderate-certainty evidence), and perhaps more effective than vaccination with LZV, since results show that it would be necessary to vaccinate 33 healthy older adults to prevent one episode of shingles. Both vaccines are probably safe (moderate-certainty evidence) for unwanted effects.
In studies that tested RZV, which requires a second dose two months later, the dropout rate (number of persons who did not receive the second dose) was higher in the group that received the real vaccine than in the group that received the fake vaccine. This can be quantified in such a way that for every 100 healthy older adults vaccinated with two doses of the real vaccine, one older adult who received the first dose of this vaccine did not receive the second dose. The reactogenicity (side effects) of the first dose of the vaccine may have contributed to this behaviour. LZV (single dose) and RZV (two doses) are probably effective in preventing shingles disease for at least three years. For both vaccines, the certainty of evidence was moderate in terms of efficacy and safety for at least three years. We have moderate-certainty evidence for all effectiveness and safety endpoints, based on studies that included a large number of healthy older adults aged 60 years or older. The evidence is current to 21 October 2022.
Amongst the 13 studies identified, there was a small amount of evidence to suggest that EMG-BFB had a beneficial effect when used with standard physiotherapy techniques. However EMG-BFB cannot currently be recommended as an effective routine treatment because other studies found no effect, and the positive trials were small.
This Cochrane review attempted to answer the question of whether palliative cytoreductive surgery is better than other palliative treatments, but no randomised clinical trials were found, addressing this issue. High-quality randomised clinical trials may become feasible to perform if their conduct and study design is thoroughly considered in all their practical and methodological aspects. Pilot randomised clinical trials, which can guide the study design of definitive randomised clinical trials, are necessary.
We found 45 studies randomising 2266 participants. Half of these looked at participants receiving dialysis (mostly haemodialysis), and the other half not receiving dialysis. Half also had diabetes and hypertension.
We are uncertain whether synbiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics improve bowel outcomes, quality of life, kidney toxin levels or kidney function.
The quality of the evidence that we found is low quality and very low certainty. All studies were conducted using moderate to poor-quality methods with too few patients. Currently, we do not have enough information from trials to know whether synbiotics, prebiotics or probiotics work to improve bowel symptoms, quality of life, kidney toxin levels, or kidney function in people with CKD. Ten studies are currently ongoing; therefore, it is possible that findings may change with the inclusion of these studies in future updates.
The evidence is up to date to 9 October 2023.
We found 20 studies in 14,897 people who used tobacco products (smoking, chewing or sniffing tobacco). The studies took place in the USA (13 studies), the UK (two studies), Sweden (two studies), Japan (one study), Malaysia (one study) and India (one study). Most studies (16) were in dental clinics and four were conducted in schools or colleges.
All studies used behavioural programmes to help people stop using tobacco; these programmes aimed to boost motivation and offer advice on stopping. Four studies also included offering people nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or e-cigarettes as well as a behavioural programme.
Nineteen studies were funded by government agencies or universities; one study reported that it received no funding.
For each type of behavioural programme tested, the studies measured how many people stopped smoking or using tobacco products for at least six months.
In all studies, the effect of receiving behavioural support from dental professionals was compared with:
· usual care (the studies did not state what this included);
· no support or advice;
· brief advice to stop smoking to improve health; or
· a less active form of behavioural support. Behavioural programmes involving dental professionals and NRT or e-cigarettes probably help more people to stop smoking. On average, 74 out of 1000 people stopped compared with 27 out of 1000 people who did not receive behavioural support (evidence from four studies in 1221 people).
Several sessions of behavioural programmes involving dental professionals may help people to stop using tobacco. On average,106 out of 1000 people stopped compared with 56 out of 1000 people who did not receive behavioural support (seven studies; 2639 people).
A single session of a behavioural programme may also help people to stop: on average, 45 out of 1000 people stopped compared with 24 out of 1000 who did not receive behavioural support (four studies; 6328 people).
We are uncertain about the effect of advice and support from dental professionals in settings other than a dental practice (such as in a school or college), because the studies that tested this were too small to show a reliable effect (three studies; 1020 people).
We are uncertain if behavioural programmes given by dental professionals had any unwanted effects, because only one study reported this information. We are moderately confident about the benefit of support from dental professionals plus NRT or e-cigarettes. We are less confident about the benefits of one, or several, sessions of behavioural support from dental professionals.
We found weaknesses in the evidence. Some studies only asked people if they had stopped using tobacco, and did not use tests – such as testing their breath or saliva – to find out if they had stopped. Some studies did not describe clearly how they were conducted, or how they assigned people to the different groups. In some studies more than half of the people dropped out of the study before it ended.
Our results may change when more, high-quality evidence becomes available. Advice and support from dental professionals that involves NRT or e-cigarettes is more likely to help people to stop smoking.
Single or multiple sessions of advice and support may help people to stop smoking or using tobacco products.
We found 19 randomised controlled trials that looked at the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on post-abortal upper genital tract infection amongst women requesting induced abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. We looked at the effect of any antibiotic prophylaxis regimen on the outcome. Overall, the risk of post-abortal upper genital tract infection in women receiving antibiotics was 59% that of women who received placebo. There were, however, differences between the trial results over and above what would be expected by chance alone. It should be noted that, if the infection is caused by a sexually transmitted organism, antibiotic prophylaxis will not protect the woman from becoming re-infected if her sexual partner has not been treated. None of the trials was done in lower or middle income countries, which is where the risk of post-abortal complications is highest. Further trials are needed to determine whether combinations of antibiotics can prevent more infections than single antibiotics, or whether antibiotic prophylaxis should be restricted to women with positive results of screening tests before the abortion.
We wanted to find out whether high protein formula is better than standard or low protein formula for preventing:
1. malnutrition (low weight for age, low height for age, or low weight or height);
2. overweight or obesity (high weight for height); and
3. other unwanted events. We searched for studies examining higher-protein formula compared with lower-protein formula in healthy infants of either sex, born at nine months of pregnancy and with normal birth weight and height.
We compared and summarized the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 11 eligible studies involving 1885 healthy, full-term, formula-fed infants. Seven studies (1629 infants) compared high-protein formula with standard-protein formula, and four studies (256 infants) compared standard-protein formula with low-protein formula. The biggest study included 1090 infants, and the smallest study included 20 infants. Ten studies were conducted in Europe and one in the USA. Most studies lasted approximately four months; only two studies lasted five years or more. Pharmaceutical companies funded all the studies.
Overall, we are unsure if feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula has any effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity in the first year of life. We are unsure if feeding healthy infants standard-protein formula compared to low-protein formula has any effect on undernutrition in childhood. The occurrence of unwanted events in formula-fed infants may be unrelated to the protein content of the formula. We are not confident about the evidence because the studies provided information in different ways, and the results varied considerably across studies. Moreover, some studies had many dropouts, which could have affected the results. Further research is likely to modify the results of this review. The evidence is current to October 2022.
Previous studies indicate that glatiramer acetate, a synthetic drug, is effective in animal models of MS, and shows some benefits in MS patients. The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of glatiramer acetate in RRMS and PMS patients.
Among the pertinent medical literature six studies met the criteria of the methodological quality necessary for their inclusion in this review. 540 RRMS patients and 1049 PMS patients contributed to this analysis.
The data showed no beneficial effects on disease progression in both MS forms, a slight beneficial effect  in the reduction of risk of relapses in RRMS patients and no benefits in PMS patients. Adverse events such as flushing, chest tightness, sweating, palpitations, anxiety and  local injection-site reactions occurred quite frequently, but no major adverse effects were observed.
Bicyclol is a novel synthetic 'anti-hepatitis' drug, used primarily in China for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Only one small, short-term randomised clinical trial was found evaluating the efficacy of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Clinicians should be aware of the lack of evidence for bicyclol.
We identified 38 randomised controlled trials involving 2543 participants who had either been treated for more than two months with benzodiazepines, or who had been diagnosed with benzodiazepine dependence. We included studies irrespective of whether benzodiazepines were prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, or any other condition.
The average age of participants was around 50 years, and the majority of participants were women in most studies. Twenty-four trials were conducted in Europe; eight trials in the US or Canada; and six trials in Asia. The trials involved a wide range of medications to facilitate reduction or discontinuation of benzodiazepine use. Fourteen of the 38 included studies were partly funded by the drug manufacturer; nine studies were funded by government agencies; and 15 studies did not state the source of funding. The duration of the trials ranged between 1 and 24 weeks; the average trial duration was 9 weeks. We extracted data on 18 different comparisons in a total of 2295 participants. We are uncertain whether valproate and tricyclic antidepressants increase the chance of discontinuing benzodiazepines, and whether benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms are reduced by pregabalin, captodiame, paroxetine, tricyclic antidepressants, and flumazenil, as we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. We are uncertain as to whether symptoms of anxiety after withdrawal of benzodiazepines are reduced by carbamazepine, pregabalin, captodiame, paroxetine, and flumazenil, as we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. The effects of the evaluated medications were too uncertain to inform clinical practice due to risk of bias (systematic errors with overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms) and risk of chance occurrence (random errors giving any result). Tolerability and safety were poorly reported across the included studies, making it impossible to assess the balance between possible benefits and adverse effects. Consequently, no conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of the interventions. The quality of the evidence was generally low or very low due to the small number of trials including a limited number of participants for each comparison; dissimilar results across studies; poor study design; and pronounced financial involvement of the pharmaceutical industry. Randomised controlled trials are therefore needed without risk of bias and random significant results involving long-term assessments of participants conducted without involvement of industry.
In this review of the medical literature oral naltrexone, with or without psychotherapy, was no better than placebo or no pharmacological treatments with regard to retention in treatment, use of the primary substance of abuse or side effects. The only outcome that was clearly in favour of naltrexone was a reduction of re incarcerations by about a half but these results were from only two studies. In single studies naltrexone was not superior to benzodiazepines or buprenorphine for retention, abstinence or side effects. The review authors identified a total of 13 randomised controlled studies that involved 1158 opioid addicts treated as outpatients following detoxification. Less than a third of participants were retained in treatment over the duration of the included studies. The mean duration was six months (range one to 10 months). None of included studies considered deaths from fatal overdoses in people treated with naltrexone.
The authors of this review assessed the efficacy and safety of laquinimod in patients with MS. Concerning the outcomes, they considered relapse, disability progression, inflammatory lesion, and brain atrophy. Among the pertinent literature only one study met the inclusion criteria. The study involved a total of 1106 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and evaluated the efficacy and safety of laquinimod as unique therapy versus placebo. As far as safety was concerned, common adverse events included headache, back pain, arthralgia, diarrhoea, cough, urinary tract infection, elevated alanine aminotransferase, insomnia, nausea, abdominal pain and sinusitis. The authors were unable to give any clear recommendations for the use of laquinimod as a DMD for MS because the study was poor quality and was funded by a pharmaceutical company. Future studies with higher methodological quality are needed to assess the potential benefits and the safety in a longer period of administration.
We searched for randomised controlled trials in March 2018. Our review includes 77 trials, involving 40,249 women and their babies, although it wasn't possible to include results form three of these trials (233 women) . We included information about the results for women and babies in two different formats: 36 trials (34,514 women) reported 'individual participant data' (IPD), where we received information about each of the individuals involved; all the other trials reported 'aggregate data' (AD), where each study reports the average information about the individuals involved in the study. By using IPD, we could conduct very thorough and accurate analyses; and by combining both the AD and the IPD, we could include all the available information on this question.
Nine of the trials included more than 1000 women, and all of these large trials were at low risk of bias. Low-dose aspirin alone was the intervention in all the large trials, and most trials overall. Almost all the women were recruited to the trials after 12 weeks' gestation. Most women were at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and the trials included women with normal blood pressure, existing long-term high blood pressure or pregnancy-induced high blood pressure. High-quality evidence showed that the use of antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia by 18%, or less than one sixth (36,716 women, 60 trials). This meant that 61 women had to be treated with an antiplatelet drug for one woman to benefit by avoiding pre-eclampsia. The risk of preterm birth was reduced by 9% (35,212 women, 47 trials) and the number of infant deaths before or around the time of birth was reduced by 15% (35,391 women, 52 trials). Antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of small-for-gestational-age babies (35,761 mothers, 50 trials) and pregnancies with serious adverse outcomes (17,382 mothers; 13 trials). Moderate-quality evidence showed that only slightly more women lost more than 500 mL of blood immediately after birth, termed postpartum haemorrhage (23,769 mothers, 19 trials), indicating that aspirin is safe. Doses of aspirin less than 75 mg appear to be safe. Higher doses might be better, but we do not know whether they increase adverse effects. Low doses of aspirin slightly reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia and its complications. As most women in this review were in trials evaluating low-dose aspirin, the reassurance about the safety of aspirin may not apply to higher doses or other antiplatelet agents. Further research should aim to identify women who are most likely to respond to low-dose aspirin treatment. While it is possible that higher doses of aspirin may be more effective, further studies are needed to determine whether higher doses are both more effective and safe for women and babies.
The two studies included in this review randomly assigned 305 women being treated with clomiphene citrate to help eggs to develop to additionally receive a medicine (urinary hCG) to trigger their release or to receive no additional treatment. We found no trials comparing other ovulation triggers given with other medicines used for ovulation induction. The evidence is current to November 2013. Giving women on clomiphene citrate additional urinary hCG may not increase their chances of delivering live babies, ovulating or becoming pregnant. Multiple pregnancies, miscarriages and preterm deliveries were not more common with or without an ovulation trigger. No serious adverse events were reported in either study. We cannot be certain whether ovulation triggers are better or worse than no ovulation triggers in women undergoing ovulation induction because not enough women were included in the two trials for definite results to be obtained. Larger trials in women undergoing ovulation induction that compare different ovulation triggers versus no additional treatment are needed.
Three trials examined the use of the drug alendronate to improve BMD in patients with HIV. These three studies were quite different from each other in terms of the populations studied and the interventions used, but even similar studies did not always have heterogeneity. A fourth study examined the use of testosterone in male patients with HIV and AIDS wasting syndrome. The four studies in this review were limited by the fact they were all very small and lasted a short amount of time, and thus they were unable to detect prevention of fractures or changes in number of patients with osteoporosis. There were also further compromises in study design. However, the limited available data show that there may be safe and perhaps effective treatments in the form of alendronate for patients with HIV who have decreased bone mineral density and, in those with AIDS wasting syndrome, testosterone.
Larger studies further examining the issue of decreased BMD are currently underway.
This area is difficult to research but better designed studies are required to provide more robust evidence.
Fourteen studies (3741 participants with IBD) met the inclusion criteria. Nine different drug trials, four non-drug trials and one multimodular trial were included in the review. Thirty ongoing studies were also identified and five studies are awaiting classification. In only four trials was managing fatigue the aim of the intervention. In the remaining trials the interventions were aimed at managing other symptoms, including fatigue. Data on fatigue were not available for the fourteen trials, therefore, the findings of this review are based on 1344 participants in nine trials. Most studies were small in size and had low or very low quality of evidence. The evidence suggests electroacupuncture may result in a large reduction in fatigue compared to control and sham electroacupuncture, however, the overall certainty of the evidence is low due to sparse data. No adverse events were reported, except for one adverse event in the sham acupuncture group.
We are very uncertain about the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy and solution-focused therapy on fatigue, as the quality of the evidence is very low.
One small study found that physical activity advice plus omega 3 and physical activity advice plus placebo may reduce fatigue compared to no physical activity advice plus omega 3. Adverse events were similar across physical activity groups, although more adverse events were reported in the no physical activity advice plus omega 3 group. Adverse events were mainly mild gastrointestinal events like diarrhoea and bloating
Compared with placebo, the drug alimumab 40 mg, administered every other week, may reduce fatigue in patients with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease, who are already known to respond to adalimumab treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. People taking adalimumab 40 mg weekly were less like to experience serious adverse events or withdraw from the trial due to adverse events, compared to people taking placebo.
The evidence suggests ferric maltol results in a slight increase in fatigue in participants with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, in remission or with mild-to-moderate disease activity. Following 12 weeks of ferric maltol treatment, less fatigue was reported in the placebo group compared to the treatment group, however, the quality of evidence is low. The effects of interventions for the management of fatigue on IBD are uncertain, with limited evidence available. No firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms (e.g. side effects) can be drawn, Further high-quality studies, with a larger number of participants, are needed to determine the potential effect of treatments on fatigue in IBD. Future studies should assess fatigue as a primary outcome, be specifically designed for fatigue management and targeted at specific IBD populations.
We identified three randomised controlled trials that compared tacrolimus with cyclosporin in patients who had received lung transplants. We found no difference in survival or rejection of the donated lungs with the drugs in lung transplant recipients. Tacrolimus seemed better in preventing serious inflammatory lung and airways diseases (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and lymphocytic bronchitis), and high blood pressure. Diabetes may occur more often in patients treated with tacrolimus compared with cyclosporin-treated patients. More patients who received tacrolimus continued treatment compared with those treated with cyclosporin.
However, these observations should be viewed cautiously because all three trials were flawed in design, the ways they were conducted, and in random errors. There were very few trials found that compared tacrolimus and cyclosporin after lung transplantation, and the numbers of patients and events were low.
Better-designed and conducted studies are needed to inform clinical decisions for people who receive lung transplants.
This review included 23 trials, involving a total of 8447 participants. The review found that antibiotics are effective in reducing the incidence of infection, both at the surgical-wound site and in the chest and urinary tract. The effect of a single dose of antibiotic is similar to that from multiple doses if the antibiotic chosen is active through the period from the beginning of surgery until the wound is sealed. There were too few data available to confirm the expected tendency for increased adverse drug-related events such as gut problems and skin reactions.
We searched for evidence up to 30 June 2016. This review includes 15 studies involving 3490 women (3 studies involving 152 women were added for this update).
Women with a stitch are less likely to have a baby who is born too early. Babies whose mothers had a stitch are also less likely to die during the first week of life. It is not clear whether a cervical stitch can prevent stillbirth or improve the baby's health once born. Inserting a stitch helps pregnant women who are at high risk avoid early births compared to no stitch. Inserting a stitch may also improve a baby's chance for survival. We found too few clinical trials to understand whether cervical stitch is more effective than other treatments for preventing early births, such as progesterone (a hormone drug used to prevent early birth). We found too few data to understand if it is better to have a stitch inserted early in pregnancy (based on the mother's previous history) or to wait to perform an ultrasound scan later in pregnancy to see if the cervix has become shortened.
How effective and safe is paracetamol, which has weak anti-inflammatory properties, compared with placebo (a substance with no active therapeutic effect), or no intervention, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (indomethacin and ibuprofen), for closure of a PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants? We searched for studies that looked at short-term (benefit and safety) and long-term (neurodevelopmental) effects of paracetamol used either alone or in combination with ibuprofen compared to ibuprofen, indomethacin, placebo, or no intervention for prevention or treatment of a significant PDA in preterm or small babies. We subclassified treatment into early (< 14 days of age) and late (≥ 14 days of age) treatment. We identified 27 studies that enrolled 2278 preterm infants. These studies compared the efficacy and safety of paracetamol alone or in combination with ibuprofen versus ibuprofen, indomethacin, placebo, or no intervention for preventive treatment (prophylaxis) or treatment of a PDA. We identified 24 ongoing studies on this topic.
When the results of the included studies were combined, we found:
- the success rate for paracetamol to close a PDA was probably higher than that of placebo and likely similar to that of ibuprofen and indomethacin;
- paracetamol appears to have fewer harmful effects on the kidney and intestine;
- in two small studies that followed children to 24 months and five years of age, there was little to no difference in neurodevelopmental disability between the children given paracetamol and those given the non-experimental medicine or placebo.
For the key outcome of the closure of a PDA after the first course of treatment, we found:
- moderate-certainty evidence that there is probably little or no difference in effectiveness between paracetamol and ibuprofen; 
- low-certainty evidence that there is probably little or no difference in effectiveness between paracetamol and indomethacin; 
- low-certainty evidence that prophylactic paracetamol may be more effective than placebo/no intervention; 
- low-certainty evidence that early paracetamol treatment may be more effective than placebo/no intervention; 
- low-certainty evidence that there is probably little or no difference between late paracetamol treatment and placebo, 
- low-certainty evidence that there is probably little or no difference in effectiveness between the combination of ibuprofen plus paracetamol and ibuprofen alone.
The majority of infants included in these studies were of moderate preterm gestation. Thus, establishing the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for PDA treatment in extremely low gestational age babies (ELGANs: less than 28 weeks' gestation) or extremely low birth weight babies (ELBW: birth weight less than 1000 grams) requires further studies.
The healthcare providers were not always 'blinded' (unaware of which drug the infants received) in the studies. Thus, we judged the quality (certainty) of the evidence to be moderate or low. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2021.
We wanted to find out whether to use samples obtained by bronchoscopy when deciding how to treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). We searched for studies involving people of any age with CF. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included two studies in this review, which involved 186 children. One study recruited 170 babies under the age of six months who were diagnosed with CF and monitored them for up to five years. The second study included 30 children with CF between the ages of five and 18 years and monitored them for up to two years. In both studies, the participants were divided into two groups completely at random, with one group given antibiotics based on samples taken via bronchoscopy and the other group given antibiotics based on samples taken from the throat. In the larger study, children had a bronchoscopy when they showed features of worsening chest symptoms, whereas children in the smaller study had a bronchoscopy when they showed an increase in the Lung Clearance Index, which is a marker of early lung disease that measures how well the air moves within the lungs. Neither study showed any difference between the groups in terms of lung function, weight, body mass index or in the score calculated by a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs when measured at either two or five years. The longer study also showed that there was no difference in how many children in each group had an infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at five years of age, or per year of follow-up, or how often a child was unwell with respiratory symptoms. In this longer study, children in the bronchoscopy group were admitted to hospital more often, although admissions were generally shorter than in the comparison group. There was no difference between the groups in the overall cost of care and health-related quality of life scores.
Side effects reported during and after bronchoscopy were not serious; the most common side effect was increased coughing (in one third of children).
There is currently not enough evidence to support the regular use of bronchoscopy to diagnose and treat lung infections in children with CF. Evidence was limited to two studies. While these studies were well designed, we could not combine their results because they used different methods of measurement. We have low confidence in the reliability of the evidence for most outcomes, and moderate confidence in the results for two outcomes (high-resolution computed tomography scoring and cost-of-care analysis). We cannot be sure about the results because of the small number of children included. Also, the studies only included young children, so we do not know if the results would be the same in adults with CF. Since the treatment of a first infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is highly successful, larger and longer studies are needed to detect small differences between the groups. Conducting such large studies is extremely difficult and more sensitive measures should be used. We last searched for evidence in November 2023.
We identified 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which included a total of 6079 women and compared 20 different types of antibiotics versus placebo (an inactive pill) or versus one another. This review found moderate-quality evidence showing that antibiotics appear to be effective in preventing infection in women undergoing non-urgent surgical removal of the uterus through the vagina or abdomen. This suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the average risk of postoperative infection after vaginal hysterectomy from about 62% to 12% to 25%, and after abdominal hysterectomy from about 39% to 8% to 26%.
However, evidence is insufficient to show whether use of prophylactic antibiotics influences rates of adverse effects (side effects), or whether any one antibiotic is more effective or safer than the others.
When antibiotics are compared head-to-head or in combination versus single antibiotics, it is unclear which individual antibiotic was more effective and safer, or whether combined antibiotics were more effective and safer than single antibiotics. The quality of the evidence for these comparisons is very low.
It is also unclear which dose regimen or route of administration of antibiotics is safest or most effective in women undergoing elective hysterectomy.
The most recent of the studies included in this review was published 14 years ago, at the time of our search. Thus findings from the included studies may not reflect current practice in perioperative and postoperative care and may not show locoregional antimicrobial resistance patterns. The quality of evidence for our main comparisons ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of this evidence are risk of bias due to poor reporting of randomisation methods, imprecision due to small sample sizes and low event rates, and inadequate reporting of adverse effects.
After searching for relevant trials up to 18 April 2018, we identified four studies conducted between 1972 and 2000. Across the four studies, a range of insecticide delivery methods were used, including handheld, vehicle-mounted, and aircraft-mounted spraying equipment. A variety of different insecticides, doses, and spraying times were also used to suit the local environment and the behaviour of the targeted mosquito species.
In three studies, the evidence was considered to be unsuitable for reliably assessing the impact of space spraying on the number of cases of malaria. The remaining study, which took place in a single state in India and covered a combined population of 18,460 people, reported the number of malaria cases in the years preceding and following the introduction of space spraying. The evidence suggested that space spraying led to a decrease in the number of cases of malaria, but as the trial was conducted over 30 years ago and within one state in India, we cannot be certain that these findings are applicable in other areas where malaria occurs. Reliable research in a variety of settings will help to establish whether and when this intervention may be worthwhile.
This overview included six Cochrane Reviews. One review compared any type of chest physiotherapy (conventional chest physiotherapy, PEP therapy, high-pressure PEP therapy, active cycle of breathing technique, autogenic drainage, exercise, vibrating (oscillating) devices) with no chest physiotherapy or coughing alone. The remaining five reviews included head-to-head comparisons of different airway clearance techniques, thus these five reviews often overlapped with each other. In this overview, we found moderate evidence that PEP therapy and vibrating (oscillating) devices have a similar effect on lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) after six months of treatment. We are unable to draw definitive conclusions for all other comparisons in terms of FEV1 because the quality of evidence is currently lacking. Likewise, we are unable to draw any definitive conclusions for other outcome measures such as individual preference and quality of life. Harms, such as acid reflux, collapsed lungs, coughing up blood, or decreased oxygen, were rarely mentioned in the original trials. There is a lack of evidence to determine if any particular airway clearance therapy is riskier than the other therapies. All of the reviews were considered to be well-conducted. However, the individual trials included in the reviews often did not report enough detailed information to allow us to properly determine trial quality. Many trials did not report enough information on outcome measures; it is unclear how this missing information would influence the results. We graded the evidence for lung function when PEP was compared to vibrating (oscillating) devices as moderate, but the evidence comparing different airway clearance techniques for other outcomes, such as individual preference and quality of life was of low or very low quality. More long-term, high-quality trials (where participants are put into groups at random) which compare different airway clearance techniques among people with CF are needed.
We identified 69 randomised controlled studies (involving 8928 women) that provided data. Data were mostly on non-emergency caesareans and most findings were supported only by low or very low-certainty evidence. This was due to many of the studies being old, with small numbers of participants or unclear methodology. A few outcomes had moderate-certainty evidence.
5-HT3 antagonists (like ondansetron, granisetron): these probably reduce nausea after surgery, and they may also reduce nausea during surgery (low-certainty evidence) and vomiting after surgery, but any effect on vomiting during surgery is unclear.
Dopamine antagonists (like metoclopramide, droperidol): these may reduce vomiting during surgery and nausea after surgery, but it is unclear whether they reduce nausea during surgery and vomiting after surgery.
Steroids (like dexamethasone): these probably reduce nausea after surgery and may reduce vomiting after surgery, but it is unclear whether steroids reduce nausea and vomiting during surgery.
Antihistamines (like dimenhydrinate, cyclizine): these may reduce nausea after surgery, but they make little or no difference to nausea and vomiting during surgery and vomiting after surgery.
Anticholinergics (like glycopyrrolate, scopolamine): these may reduce nausea during surgery and vomiting after surgery, but they may make little to no difference to vomiting during surgery. There were no studies on nausea after surgery,
Sedatives (like propofol, midazolam, ketamine): these probably reduce nausea and vomiting during surgery and may reduce vomiting after surgery, but it is uncertain whether they reduce nausea after surgery.
Opioid antagonists (like nalbuphine): only one small study provided data on nausea and vomiting after surgery, and found they may make little or no difference.
Acupressure/acupuncture: this may reduce vomiting during surgery but it is uncertain if it reduces nausea during surgery or nausea and vomiting after surgery.
Ginger: it is unclear if ginger reduces nausea and vomiting during surgery or nausea and vomiting after surgery.
Few studies assessed women's views. What limited data there were on side effects did not find any differences. Several classes of drugs may help to reduce the number of women who experience nausea and vomiting during and after regional anaesthesia for caesarean births, although more data are needed. Acupressure may also help but we did not find enough data on ginger. Very few studies looked at women’s views and overall, there were not enough data on possible side effects.
We included 2 new studies with 1323 children, for a total of 45 studies with 5888 children aged 0 to 18 years published between 1964 and 2021. The three types of glucocorticoids used in the new studies were budesonide, dexamethasone, and prednisolone. The most recent study compared the effectiveness of budesonide and dexamethasone. The other new study compared the effectiveness of dexamethasone and prednisolone, as well as a small dose of dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) versus 0.60 mg/kg dexamethasone. We added the data from the new study that compared the doses of dexamethasone to previously included studies looking at the same comparison. Funding sources included government (11%), academic or research institute (7%), industry (18%), or foundations (9%). More than half of the studies (55%) did not report funding sources. Compared to prednisolone, dexamethasone showed no improvement in croup score at two and six hours after presenting to the hospital or emergency department, and probably reduced return visits or (re)admissions for croup by almost half. The addition of supplemental glucocorticoid favoured dexamethasone versus prednisolone. Compared to 0.15 mg/kg dexamethasone, the standard dose of 0.60 mg/kg probably reduced the severity of croup as assessed by the croup scoring scale at 24 hours after presenting to the hospital or emergency department. However, we did not find any important difference between groups in croup scoring scale at 2, 6, or 12 hours, return visits or (re)admissions of children, or length of stay in the hospital or emergency department. The need for additional treatments such as the use of other drugs like epinephrine, supplemental glucocorticoid, or the use of a tube to help breathing did not differ between 0.15 mg/kg and 0.60 mg/kg dexamethasone. No serious adverse events from the use of the glucocorticoids were reported in the newly included studies. The evidence has not changed that glucocorticoids reduce symptoms of croup at two hours, shorten hospital stays, and reduce the rate of return visits or (re)admissions compared to placebo (dummy treatment). A small dose of dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg may be as effective as the standard dose of 0.60 mg/kg. More studies are needed to strengthen the evidence for the effectiveness of low-dose dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg to treat croup. We conclude that glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of croup in children. Most studies (98%) had problems related to their methods, reporting issues, or both. For any glucocorticoid compared to placebo, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for change in croup score after 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours and return visits or (re)admissions due to study variability, imprecision and inconsistency of study results, and risk of bias. There is little evidence that reporting bias influenced our results for return visits or (re)admissions, or both. Similar threats to the certainty of the evidence were present in the other comparisons in this review, including concerns related to risk of bias and inconsistency and imprecision of study results.
This review investigates the effects of brief family intervention for people with schizophrenia, compared to standard or usual care. A search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trial register was carried out in July 2012. Four randomised studies, with a total of 163 participants were included. Results were limited, so it is not clear if brief family intervention reduces admission to hospital, decreases people using health services and reduces relapse for people with schizophrenia. The review found some evidence that brief family intervention might increase the understanding of family members about mental illness. However, all main findings are not strong and based on low or very low quality evidence. Despite this, the authors of the review suggest that brief family intervention should not be completely dismissed, as it is in a current state of demand and there are usually resources or local services available for people with mental health problems and their families to participate in as a part of recovery. The authors also suggest that brief family intervention could be improved to be more effective but this would depend on larger and better studies of brief family intervention being carried out, which would help guide good practice and lead to better outcomes for people with schizophrenia.
This plain language summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray, from RETHINK.
Four clinical trials with 355 children were identified which compared the effect of symptom-based versus to peak flow written action plans when all other co-interventions were similar. Children assigned to a symptom-based plan less frequently required an acute care visit for asthma compared to those who received a peak flow based plan. Most other outcomes were similar with the exception of more children intending to continue using the symptom-based compared to the peak-flow based written action plan.
Six trials involving 321 infants in three different settings were reviewed. The review was unable to identify clear benefits in outcomes such as duration of hospitalisation or improvement in oxygenation though there were suggestions that some patients may benefit particularly in recurrently wheezy infants treated at home. Well designed studies are required to clarify the role of these agents in young children with wheeze.
We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low birth weight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants with a symptomatic PDA diagnosed by a combination of specific clinical features and/or ultrasound of the heart. Included studies compared indomethacin versus no treatment or placebo. We searched for studies that had been published up to 31 July 2020. This review of 14 clinical trials (880 infants) found that indomethacin is very effective in closing a PDA, reducing the risk of PDA being open at one week by 70%, when compared to no treatment or placebo. Of the 14 total studies, eight reported on death, which was not different between groups. Only one study reported on the number of infants needing oxygen at 28 days of life, and only one study reported on the number of infants using oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (how many weeks pregnancy plus how long the infant has been alive). Data are not adequate to permit conclusions on these outcomes. Both studies showed no difference between those who received indomethacin or no treatment or placebo. Medication side effects or other adverse effects (such as gut bleeding, kidney injury, and bowel infection/lack of blood flow called necrotizing enterocolitis) were not different between groups. According to GRADE (a method used to score the certainty of trials supporting each outcome), high-certainty evidence shows that indomethacin is effective in closing a PDA in a preterm infant with symptoms. However, there is not enough evidence to say if indomethacin helps to reduce death or lung injury. Also, there is not enough evidence to say if indomethacin causes increased harm compared to no treatment or placebo. More studies are needed to see if indomethacin can reduce death or lung injury in infants with symptomatic PDA.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing either two types of antibiotic therapy or an antibiotic versus a placebo in children with pneumonia. We identified seven studies (1912 children). Within each study, there were some children who hadM. pneumoniaebut we could not extract relevant data relating to efficacy or adverse events relating only to children withM. pneumoniae. Overall the quality of the evidence for each of the main outcomes is very low as there are insufficient data for any outcome. Hence, currently, there is insufficient evidence to show conclusively that antibiotics are effective in children with LRTI caused byM. pneumoniae.
We wanted to find out how infliximab compares to other medicines or dummy treatment (placebo) for getting Crohn's into remission or improving symptoms. We also wanted to find out how safe it is compared to other medicines. We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing infliximab with any other medical treatment in adults with Crohn's disease. We found 10 studies including 1101 participants. They looked at:
– infliximab compared to placebo (one study);
– infliximab plus purine analogues compared to purine analogues alone (four studies);
– infliximab compared to purine analogues (medicines called azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) (two studies);
– infliximab compared to a biosimilar (one study);
– different doses of infliximab compared to each other (two studies).
Two studies looked at people with Crohn's disease who had fistulas. A fistula is a narrow tunnel that can develop between your gut and your skin or another organ, such as your bladder. Infliximab plus purine analogues (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) is probably more effective than purine analogues alone at getting Crohn's into remission after 24 to 26 weeks of treatment. It may also be better at improving symptoms. The two treatments may be similar in terms of side effects.
Infliximab alone may be more effective than purine analogues alone for getting Crohn's into remission and improving symptoms after 26 weeks of treatment. The two treatments may be similar in terms of side effects.
Infliximab may be as effective as the biosimilar at getting Crohn's into remission and improving symptoms after six weeks of treatment. The two treatments may be similar in terms of side effects.
There is not enough evidence to compare the other treatments we looked at in this review. The evidence is mostly of low and very low quality. This is because of problems with the way the trials were carried out, the small number of people who took part and problems with how the results were reported. This review is up-to-date to 4 March 2023.
We searched for evidence for randomised controlled trials (latest July 2019). We identified nine studies, involving 695 women with GDM. All trials compared probiotics with placebo. The certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low or low. The overall risk of bias was low to unclear.
Seven trials were conducted in Iran; one in Thailand, and one in Ireland. Trials took place in hospitals and universities.
We are uncertain if there is any difference between probiotic and placebo in rates of: high blood-pressure disorders (three studies, 256 participants, low-certainty evidence); caesarean section (three studies, 267 women, low-certainty evidence); and large-for-gestational-age babies (two studies, 174 participants, low-certainty evidence).
We are uncertain if there is any difference between probiotic and placebo for induction of labour (one study, 127 participants, very low-certainty evidence) and low blood glucose levels in the newborn (three studies, 177 participants, low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there is any difference between probiotics and placebo for heavy bleeding immediately after birth, weight gain during pregnancy or total gestational weight gain.
We are uncertain if there is any difference in fasting blood glucose between probiotics and placebo (seven studies, 554 participants). Probiotics may be assoicated with a slight reduction in triglycerides and total cholesterol (four studies, 320 participants). There was reduction in insulin secretion with probiotics (seven studies, 505 participants). One trial (60 participants) showed no difference between groups in need for insulin.
Biomarkers, did show a reduction in insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), (seven studies, 505 participants) and insulin resistance and β cell function (HOMA-B) (two studies,130 participants) with probiotics. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) increased (four studies, 276 participants) with probiotics.
Inflammatory markers, hs-CRP (four studies, 248 participants) and interleukin 6 (two studies, 128 participants) were reduced with probiotics. Antioxidant total glutathione was increased (two studies, 120 participants) and the oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde was reduced with probiotics (three studies, 176 participants). We are uncertain if there is any difference in total antioxidant capacity (four studies 266 participants).
For the newborn baby, we are uncertain if there is any difference between groups for: birthweight, gestational age at birth, preterm births, large babies, head circumference and length scores, or need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. The number of babies with high levels of bilirubin was reduced with probiotics.
No adverse events were reported by the trials. Based on the clinical trials available, the evidence is limited to support the use of probiotics as treatment for women with GDM to improve pregnancy outcomes for mothers and their babies. Larger well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the effects of probiotics on management of glucose levels and when available, they can be included in the update of this review.
We included 104 studies in this review. Seventy-one of these were new or had been updated since the last time this review was published in 2006.
Twelve of these studies did not report how many people were included in their research. In total across the rest of the studies, 29,682 people were given an anticholinergic drug compared to 17,424 people who were given a placebo. The smallest study was made up of 18 people while the largest had 2334 participants. Most of the studies we included in the review lasted for 12 weeks. One study investigated symptoms only in men, while nine looked at symptoms in women. The rest of the studies included both men and women.
We only included studies that used anticholinergic drugs taken by mouth, and only at dosages that doctors normally prescribe to patients. Across the studies, nine different anticholinergic drugs were included: darifenacin; fesoterodine; imidafenacin; oxybutynin; propantheline; propiverine; solifenacin; tolterodine and trospium. Seventy studies included in this review were funded by the companies that make and sell the drugs. We found that people who take an anticholinergic drug for overactive bladder may feel a positive change in their quality of life. Also, our results show that more patients will probably perceive an improvement or cure of their symptoms of overactive bladder when compared to those who take the placebo treatment.
Taking an anticholinergic drug probably results in a small reduction in the number of urgency episodes and the number of times people with overactive bladder go to the toilet in one day.
Twenty-two people in every 100 given an anticholinergic drug felt they had a dry mouth as a side effect of the drug, compared to 6 in 100 taking placebo. Taking anticholinergics may therefore increase the risk of having a dry mouth. Anticholinergics may also result in an increased risk of urinary retention: fewer than 2 in every 100 people felt they were unable to completely empty their bladder after taking an anticholinergic drug in comparison to fewer than 0.5 in every 100 people after taking placebo. We found that anticholinergic drugs could result in small but important changes to a person’s quality of life and their overactive bladder symptoms, however it is unclear if these changes can be sustained over a long period of time.
We searched for evidence in April 2017 and identified 40 trials, involving over 11,000 women, that contributed information to this review. The trials varied in the quality of their methods.
All but six studies compared epidural analgesia with injected opioid drugs. Epidurals may relieve labour pain more effectively than opioids, and more women may be more satisfied with epidural as pain relief. Overall, women using epidural analgesia may be more likely to require forceps or ventouse to assist with the birth when compared with opioid drugs. However we did not see this effect in studies conducted since 2005, where the use of lower concentrations of local anaesthetic and more modern epidural techniques such as patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) were more likely. Epidural in comparison to opioids probably makes little or no difference to caesarean section rates, women with long-term backache, effects on the baby at birth or the number of babies who were admitted to neonatal intensive care.
Women who used epidurals can have problems passing urine and can suffer fever. There are highly variable findings such as a longer labour, experiencing very low blood pressure, and being unable to move for a period of time after the birth (motor blockade), probably due to higher concentrations of local anaesthetic being used in the epidural or the use of epidural infusions rather than epidural doses of pain relief administered at intervals. However, women who received opioid drugs also showed some side effects such as a slowing of their breathing so that they needed to wear an oxygen mask, and more nausea and vomiting. More babies whose mothers received opioids were given a drug to counteract the effects of the opioids. There was no difference between women in the epidural or opioid groups for postnatal depression, headaches, itching, shivering, or drowsiness.
Women with epidurals reported less pain compared to women with placebo or no treatment, or acu-stimulation. Pain was not reported in the trials that compared epidural with inhaled analgesia, or continuous support. Epidurals may reduce pain during labour more effectively than any other form of pain relief, and may increase maternal satisfaction with pain relief. However, some women who have an epidural instead of opioid drugs may be more likely to have an assisted vaginal birth, but this finding probably reflects the higher concentrations of local anaesthetics used traditionally rather than the low concentrations of modern epidurals. Further research would be helpful, using more consistent measures of reducing the adverse outcomes with epidurals.
We identified five RCTs with a total of 827 participants. Seven hundred thirty participants (384 received continuous sutures and 346 interrupted sutures) provided data for this review. Participants had abdominal or groin operations. The only outcomes reported were, superficial surgical site infection, superficial wound breakdown and length of hospital stay. No other important outcomes, including quality of life, long-term patient outcomes and use of healthcare resources, were reported.
Approximately 6% of participants developed superficial surgical site infection, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants who developed these. Approximately 4% of participants developed superficial wound breakdown. The proportion of participants with this problem in the continuous suture group was approximately one-tenth of that in the interrupted suture group. Most wound breakdowns occurred in two trials that used absorbable sutures for continuous suturing and non-absorbable sutures for interrupted suturing. Non-absorbable sutures are removed seven to nine days after surgery, but absorbable sutures are not removed, and so support the wound for longer - which may account for the difference in distribution of this problem between groups. There was no significant difference between groups for length of hospital stay.
Superficial wound breakdown is reduced by continuous subcuticular suturing. However, the trials that contributed to this result had suture removal in only one group (interrupted sutures), which may have led to this observation. The number of participants included in this review was small and follow-up after surgery was short. The overall quality of evidence was very low. Levels of bias across the studies were mostly high or unclear, so there may have been flaws in trial organisation that could produce erroneous results. Further well-designed trials at low risk of bias are necessary.
In our study we assessed the different techniques used for resealing the waters. We aimed to compare the survival of babies affected with this condition before and after birth and look at the rates of complications in both the babies and mothers. We searched for trials (30 May 2016) and found two studies that compared treatments for resealing the membranes after they had broken. These trials involved 141 women in total and compared two completely different modes of treatment.
One trial compared the use of an oral immunological membrane sealant to stimulate the body’s immune system to mend the area where the seal has broken and the other trial placed a mechanical sealing device over the cervix (neck of the womb) to stop fluid leaking. Unfortunately, neither trial provided any data relating to death of the baby within the womb or in the first 28 days of life (perinatal mortality).
There was limited evidence to suggest that oral immunological membrane sealant was associated with a fewer babies being before 37 weeks’ gestation and a reduction in the number of babies that died within the first 28 days. However, these results are based on very low-quality evidence from one small trial (with data from 94 women) that we judged to be at a high risk of bias.
There was no clear difference between the mechanical sealing device group and the control group in relation to the number of babies who contracted a serious infection (neonatal sepsis) or chorioamnionitis (a bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the baby in the womb). Although these results are based on very low-quality evidence from one small trial (involving 35 women) judged to be at a high risk of bias. Overall, our question remains unanswered - we do not have enough data to fully evaluate sealing procedures for PPROM.
This review demonstrates the lack of research in this area regarding the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments for PPROM. We recommend that more research is needed to look at the different techniques for sealing broken waters and that this research should focus on the effectiveness of the treatment in improving overall outcomes. The safety of the treatments to both mother and baby must be further evaluated before sealing techniques can be recommended to prevent adverse outcomes.
This review found some trials comparing the effects of adding second-generation antipsychotic drugs or placebo to antidepressants in obsessive compulsive disorder. There were only 11 trials on three second-generation antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone). While not much can be said about olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone showed some efficacy benefit, but also adverse effects.
Spermicides have been used as birth control for thousands of years. Studies have recently looked at how well they work to prevent pregnancy and whether women like them. Spermicides contain an active ingredient (usually nonoxynol-9) and something to disperse the product, such as foam or vaginal suppository (pessary). This review compared how well different spermicides worked for birth control when used alone.
In August 2013, we did computer searches for randomized trials of spermicides used for birth control. We have not found any new trials since the initial review. For the initial review, we also wrote to researchers to find other trials.
Trials had to focus on a spermicide used alone for birth control. The product could be compared to a different spermicide, the same spermicide used with a barrier method, another dose of the same spermicide, a different base for the same product, or another type of birth control. Each study must have had data on pregnancy.
We located reports from 14 trials for the initial review. We have not found any new trials since then. The largest trial compared five different spermicides. The gel with the smallest amount of nonoxynol-9 did not prevent pregnancy as well as products with more of the same ingredient. Women liked the gel better than the film or suppository. Few differences were found in the other studies. These trials had problems recruiting women into the studies and then keeping them until the trial ended. Large losses to follow up can bias the results.
We assessed the quality of the evidence for quality of life as very low due to the young age of the participants, Insufficient blinding, small number of participants, and imprecision because of wide range of confidence intervals. The effects of exercise-based CR for people with implantable VADs were not clear. The current evidence is inadequate to assess the benefits and harms of exercise-based CR for people with implantable VADs compared with usual care. The amount of randomised controlled trial evidence was very limited and of very low quality. In addition, the training duration was very short term. High-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to collect data on events (death and rehospitalisation), patient-related outcomes (including quality of life), and cost.
This evidence is current to February 2016. Males and females of all ages diagnosed with PH were included in this review. We selected only randomised clinical trials. All trials used a comparison to no treatment. Trial durations ranged from 12 to 16 weeks. This review involves five trials on 962 participants. All included studies were sponsored by the maker of the drug. Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators appear to reduce lung pressures and improve exercise capacity in PAH and recurrent or inoperable CTEPH, but not in PH due to left heart disease. It is uncertain if these drugs have an effect on death rates and general health decline, or if they may be associated with serious side effects. There is evidence that suggests these drugs should not be taken at the same time as phosphodiesterase-V inhibitors. One outcome was considered to be high quality according to the GRADE scoring system. Two were considered moderate strength and eight outcomes were considered low or very low strength. This means the results reported may not represent the true effect.
The purpose of this review was to examine the effect of psychosocial and psychological interventions to reduce the risk of postpartum depression compared with usual care. This review includes data from 28 randomised controlled trials involving almost 17,000 women. The preventative interventions evaluated in the included trials were diverse and the end-points differed widely but the methodological quality was good to excellent. A clear beneficial effect in the prevention of postpartum depression was found from a range of psychosocial and psychological interventions. Promising interventions included professionally-based postpartum home visits, lay- or peer-based postpartum telephone support, and interpersonal psychotherapy. Interventions provided by various health professionals and lay individuals were similarly beneficial. Interventions that were individually-based were beneficial as were those that involved multiple contacts. There is also evidence that interventions initiated postnatally assisted in preventing postpartum depression as were those specifically targeting 'at-risk' mothers. Many questions remain unanswered and additional research is needed.
Irrespective of the type or combination of anticoagulant, no benefit of anticoagulant treatment was found for live births. Obstetric complications were not clearly affected by any treatment regimen. Injection of low molecular weight heparin caused local skin reactions (pain, itching, swelling) in one study (side effects were not regularly reported in all studies). In the nine reviewed studies quality varied and different treatments were studied. Three studies were considered at high risk of bias. The number of studies on this topic remains limited.
Thrombophilia refers to blood clotting disorders associated with a predisposition to thrombosis and thus increased risk for thrombotic events. It can be inherited as well as acquired, as is the case in the antiphospholipid syndrome. Both inherited and acquired thrombophilia are associated with vascular thrombosis as well as pregnancy complications including recurrent miscarriage and premature delivery.
We identified 18 relevant trials, involving 633 participants which evaluated this type of therapy, up to September 2014. Treadmill training did improve gait speed, and stride length; but walking distance and cadence did not improve. Acceptability of treadmill training for study participants was good and adverse events were rare. It seems that such devices could be beneficial and could be applied in routine rehabilitation. However, it is still not clear when and how often they should be used and how long a benefit lasts.
The quality of this evidence for the primary outcomes was moderate to low. Adverse events were not reported in studies and drop outs did not occur more frequently in people receiving treadmill training. Also we investigated only gait parameters, improvements of activities and/or quality of life were not investigated.
The review aimed to look at the evidence from studies testing the use of ultrasound in clinical practice. Six trials were included in the review. Poor reporting of trial methods made it difficult to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. The six trials involved a total of 606 participants with acute ankle sprains of relatively short duration. Five trials compared ultrasound therapy with sham ultrasound (machine turned off). Three of the six trials included single comparisons of ultrasound with three other treatments. The main results were from the review of the five placebo-controlled trials (sham ultrasound). These found that ultrasound therapy does not seem to enhance recovery or help to reduce pain and swelling after an ankle sprain, or improve the ability to stand on the affected foot and ankle. Most ankle sprains heal quickly. While ultrasound may still improve recovery in a small way, this potential benefit is probably too small to be important.
We wanted to find out if lurasidone:
• Is more effective than traditional antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, in reducing schizophrenia symptoms.
• Causes fewer unwanted effects.
• Improves quality of life or reduces the risk of death by suicide or natural causes. We reviewed clinical trials comparing lurasidone with traditional antipsychotic medications. Our focus was on changes in schizophrenia symptoms and whether lurasidone caused any unwanted effects. We also looked for evidence on quality of life, deaths by suicide or natural causes, and other important outcomes. We found two studies that included 308 adults with schizophrenia (220 men and 85 women). These studies compared lurasidone with haloperidol, a traditional antipsychotic. The results showed:
• Symptoms of schizophrenia: It is unclear whether lurasidone improves symptoms as measured by common scales (e.g., the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale). One study suggested a slight improvement, but we are very uncertain about these results.
• Unwanted effects: It is unclear whether lurasidone causes fewer or more unwanted effects compared to haloperidol.
• Other outcomes: No studies examined whether lurasidone reduces the risk of suicide or improves quality of life. The evidence is based on only two small studies, limiting our confidence in the results. Additionally, the studies were conducted in specific populations, so the findings may not apply to everyone with schizophrenia. Both studies had limitations in their design, which may affect the reliability of their results. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.
This review identified 24 studies enrolling 2,610 patients comparing teicoplanin and vancomycin in those with either proven or suspected infection. Teicoplanin was as effective as vancomycin for treating infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus with similar results for clinical cure, microbiological cure and death. However, there were less adverse events (skin rash and red man syndrome) and it caused significantly less damage to the kidneys.
We found five studies that involved a total of 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers. Three studies took place in high income-countries and one each in middle- and low-income countries.
The studies compared:
- working in partnership against usual practice without partnership working (2 studies); and
- working in partnership as part of a wider strategy to promote person-centred health services, against the same wider strategy without partnership working (3 studies).
No studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another. The studies provided insufficient evidence to determine if working in partnership had any effects compared to usual practice or wider strategies with no working in partnership.
No studies investigated:
- impacts on the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities, or
- the resources needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
Few studies investigated:
- impacts on changes to health services;
- users’ ratings of health services;
- health service use; and
- adverse events.
The few studies that did investigate these outcomes either did not report usable information or produced findings in which we have very little confidence. These studies were small, used methods likely to introduce errors in their results and focused on specific settings or populations. Their results are unlikely to reflect the results of all the studies that have been conducted in this area, some of which have not made their results public yet. There is not enough robust evidence to determine the effects of consumers and providers working in partnership to plan, deliver or evaluate health services.
This review highlights the need for well-designed studies with a clear focus on evaluating the effects of partnerships for promoting person-centred care in health services. This area of research may also benefit from studies that investigate why certain partnerships between consumers and healthcare providers may be more successful than others, and an accompanying qualitative evidence synthesis addressing this aspect is forthcoming. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to April 2019.
Method: We reviewed randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of any of the drugs commonly used to treat cognitive impairment after TBI. We included only studies which started treatment at least 12 months after the injury; by this time the cognitive impairment is usually stable.
Results: We identified only four trials for inclusion. These investigated four different drugs—modafinil; the experimental drug (−)-OSU6162; atomoxetine; and rivastigmine—against placebo. On most measures there was no difference between treatment and placebo. Furthermore, the quality of the evidence was assessed as very low.
The experimental drug called (−)-OSU6162 was better than placebo on three cognitive measures, although this was a small study with only six participants with TBI. Modafinil, atomoxetine and rivastigmine were not found to be better than placebo. No difference between modafinil and placebo was found on assessment of clinical global improvement. Compared to placebo, more participants on modafinil and fewer on rivastigmine dropped out of the trials. More people taking modafinil, atomoxetine and rivastigmine experienced adverse effects than those on placebo, although the difference is most likely due to chance. Only nausea was statistically more likely in those taking rivastigmine. In the study of (−)-OSU6162, one participant of three given placebo experienced adverse effects requiring a dose reduction, with no drop-outs reported. No studies reported any deaths.
Conclusion: Recommendations for, or against, drug treatment of chronic cognitive impairment in TBI cannot be made on the basis of current evidence.
This review examined the effectiveness of compression bandages versus no compression, and compared different types of compression bandages and stockings. We looked at how well these different treatments work in terms of ulcer healing. We found that applying compression was better than not using compression, and that multi-component bandages worked better than single-component systems. Multi-component systems (bandages or stockings) appear to perform better when one part is an elastic (stretchy) bandage. A very detailed analysis showed that a system called the 'four-layer bandage' or '4LB' (i.e. four different bandages applied to the leg, including an elastic one) heals ulcers faster than the 'short-stretch bandage' or 'SSB' (a type of bandage with very minimal stretch).
We include 16 studies in this review with 5683 randomised participants. Nine different treatment groups were evaluated: Aspirin (ASA) or aspirin and dipyridamole (ASA/DIP) versus placebo or nothing (six studies); ASA or ASA/DIP versus pentoxifylline (two studies); ASA/DIP versus indobufen (one study); ASA or ASA/DIP versus vitamin K antagonists (two studies); ASA/DIP versus low molecular weight heparin (one study); ticlopidine versus placebo (one study); ASA versus prostaglandin E1 (one study); ASA versus naftidrofuryl (one study); and clopidogrel and ASA versus ASA alone (one study). We evaluated the different treatment comparisons separately, and, where possible, we evaluated separately those participants who received different types of grafts, venous or prosthetic.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence from the review was low to moderate, as there were few studies to provide evidence for the different comparisons; several of the included studies randomised and analysed participants in a way that could introduce bias; and many of the prespecified outcomes of the review were not addressed within the studies, or were reported on in different ways between studies. Also, the treatment dosages varied between studies. Overall study quality was moderate, with the largest problem being that the majority of studies did not described their methods of randomisation or blinding of those that evaluated the outcomes. The other main issue with study quality was not blinding participants or personnel to the treatment received.
Key results
The comparison of ASA or ASA and dipyridamole (ASA/DIP) versus placebo or nothing, included the most studies (six), which allowed for robust analysis. For this treatment group, there was improved graft patency in the ASA or ASA/DIP treatment group. There was an improvement in those that received prosthetic grafts, but not in those that received venous grafts. Only a single study evaluated secondary patency, for which there was no difference between treatment groups. For this comparison there was no difference for any of the side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, bleeding and wound/graft infection. Amputations, cardiovascular events and death from any cause were also similar between the treatment groups. The comparison of ASA or ASA/DIP versus vitamin K antagonists included two studies, one of which was very large, with over 2000 participants. There were no differences between treatment for primary graft patency at three, six, 12 or 24 months, and there was also no evidence of a difference for limb amputation, cardiovascular events or mortality. One large study evaluated clopidogrel and ASA versus ASA alone, and for all grafts (including prosthetic and venous grafts) there was no evidence of a difference of primary patency at 24 months. There was evidence of increased total bleeding in the clopidogrel and ASA group, from an increase in mild and moderate bleeding, but there was no difference in severe or fatal bleeding. There was no difference between the treatment groups for limb amputation or death from any cause. For the remaining treatment comparisons there is not currently enough evidence to draw any robust conclusions about the efficacy or safety of the treatment on graft patency after peripheral bypass.
This review identified three trials (involving 360 women and their infants), but one trial did not provide any relevant data. The trials were small and were assessed as being at a low or unclear risk of bias. The trials did not report many outcomes of relevance to this review. We did find limited evidence to suggest that when magnesium sulphate was given to mothers in preterm labour, differences in the dose (high-dose versus low-dose) did not impact on the number of babies that died (very low quality evidence). There were no data to assess other important outcomes: birth less than 48 hours after entry to the trial, or serious outcomes for mothers or their babies.
The included trials provided very few data for other outcomes relevant to this review (overall, we were only able to examine eight of the 45 outcomes we wanted to examine).
One trial did find that the rate of newborn respiratory distress syndrome (low quality evidence) and the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit were reduced with high-dose magnesium sulphate (compared to the babies born to the group of women who were given low-dose magnesium sulphate). However, this result is based on evidence from one small study and should therefore be interpreted with caution.
The rate of caesarean birth did not differ between those women given high-dose and those women given low-dose magnesium sulphate. Nor were there any differences between groups in terms of the number of babies that died before birth or during the subsequent month or the number of babies with low levels of calcium in their blood, low bone density or bone fractures. The frequency of self-reported adverse effects in mothers including flushing, headache (two trials, 248 women), or nausea and vomiting (one trial, 100 women) did not differ between high-dose and low-dose magnesium sulphate groups. Pulmonary oedema was reported in two mothers given high-dose magnesium sulphate, and in none of the mothers given low-dose magnesium sulphate.
No trials have looked at different durations of treatment, timing and other ways of giving magnesium sulphate to mothers going in to labour too early.
Further trials are needed to address the lack of evidence regarding the best dose, duration of therapy, timing of therapy and role for repeat dosing in terms of efficacy and safety for mothers and their children.
We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer our review question and found 29 studies that assessed the safety and benefit of splinting for people with CTS. The average ages of participants were between 42 and 60 years, the number of participants was 1937, and 81% were women. Most had mild-to-moderate symptoms. When worn for fewer than three months, splinting may not improve CTS symptoms and probably does not improve hand function compared with no intervention. However, people who used a night-time splint tended to report that overall they felt improvement compared with those that did not use a splint.
In the longer term (more than 3 months), we are still uncertain of the benefits of splinting due to few studies and inconsistent findings across similar studies. We cannot say for certain if splinting provides meaningful improvements in symptoms or function.
We are also uncertain if splinting reduces the need for surgery because only three studies reported this outcome. Splinting may cause temporary side effects such as difficulty in falling asleep or transient tingling after removal of the splint; none of the trials reported any serious side effects. None of the studies reported whether splints improved quality of life.
Some studies assessed if splinting improves outcomes when delivered alongside other treatments. The results suggested that splinting may make little or no difference to outcomes when given together with corticosteroid injection or with various types of rehabilitation.
Splinting was compared with other types of treatments. Splinting does not appear to improve outcomes compared with corticosteroid (injection or oral), exercises, kinesiology taping (stretchy tape), rigid taping, and probably does not improve outcomes compared with platelet-rich plasma (concentrate of plasma and platelet derived from blood) or extracorporeal shock wave treatment (pulses of high energy sound).
Some studies compared different splint-wearing regimens. One study found that six months of splinting may improve symptoms and function compared with six weeks of splinting. Another study found that full-time splinting may not improve outcomes compared to night-time splinting. Currently, there is limited evidence supporting the use of wrist splints to treat CTS as there are few studies and their findings are inconsistent. While it appears that splinting may not make symptoms worse or result in side effects, splinting may provide little or no benefit for CTS symptoms and hand function, especially in the short term (less than 3 months). One study suggests that night-time splinting may increase the chance of overall improvement compared with no treatment. Benefits of splinting may occur after months of use, but we need well-designed research studies to establish how effective splinting is, and to identify the best way to use splints (night-time or full-time use; long-term or short-term use).
Splinting is relatively inexpensive and has no known long-term side effects. Therefore, even small benefits may justify its use in people who are not interested in invasive interventions such as surgery. People in the studies were aware of their treatment. This knowledge can produce more favourable assessments of benefit than when people are unaware of treatment ('blinded'). In the few studies that examined the same treatments and outcomes, findings were inconsistent.
The evidence is up-to-date to December 2021.
These so called friendly bacteria have been used in several studies to treat acute infectious diarrhoea with encouraging results. This review found four trials involving children with persistent diarrhoea. Two studies with a combined total of 324, showed that probiotics shorten the duration of diarrhoea and reduce the stool frequency on day-5. One study (235 children) suggested that probiotics reduce the hospital stay. Three out of four trials reported that no adverse events occurred. However, this review is limited by few trials with small number of participants, and therefore may not represent a reliable estimate of probiotics' effect.
We evaluated the evidence from 12 randomised controlled trials that either compared different types of foam dressings, or compared foam dressings with other types of wound dressings. We found no evidence to suggest that polyurethane foam dressings are significantly better or worse than hydrocellular foam dressings in venous leg ulcer healing. Similarly, we found no evidence to suggest that foam dressings are significantly better or worse than other types of dressings (paraffin-impregnated gauze dressings, hydrocapillary dressings, hydrocolloid dressings, knitted viscose dressings, or protease-modulating matrix dressings), for the healing of venous leg ulcers. We found insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions regarding: adverse events, quality of life, costs, pain, or dressing performance. Overall, the current evidence is of low or unclear methodological quality. This limits the making of any specific recommendations regarding the use of foam dressings. Further, good quality evidence is required before definitive conclusions can be made regarding the role of foam dressings in the management of venous leg ulcers.
We wanted to find out if text messaging was effective in improving medication adherence in people with heart disease compared to people who did not receive text messages. We were also interested in the effects of text messaging on fatal cardiovascular events (death from heart disease), non-fatal cardiovascular events (heart complications or stroke), combined cardiovascular events (death from heart disease, heart complications, or stroke), blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate. We searched medical databases for studies looking at the effects of mobile phone text messaging on medication adherence in people with heart disease. We found 18 studies involving 8136 people with heart disease. The studies took place in 11 countries. All studies compared using text messages to not using text messages. All studies took place in middle- and high-income countries, with no studies being performed in low-income countries. People had various types of heart diseases and were on average 53 to 64 years old. Most people came from hospitals or cardiac rehabilitation facilities. Studies lasted for one to 12 months. The delivery method and frequency of text messages differed amongst studies. Some studies sent text messages customised to patient characteristics and allowed people to reply to the messages. The content of text messages also varied across studies. Generally, text messages included medication reminders and healthy lifestyle information such as diet, physical activity, and weight loss.
The studies used different ways of measuring and definitions of medication adherence, which prevented us from combining the findings of the studies for this outcome. As a result, the combined effects of text messaging on medication adherence are unknown. Of the 18 included studies, 10 studies showed that text messaging was effective in improving medication adherence. The other eight studies showed either a reduction or no difference in medication adherence compared to those people who did not receive text messages. Given that results on medication adherence differed across studies, we are not sure if text messaging can improve medication adherence.
We found that text messaging may make little to no difference to fatal cardiovascular events (death from heart disease). In addition, we are very uncertain whether using text messaging can reduce blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, non-fatal cardiovascular events (heart complications or stroke), and combined cardiovascular events (death from heart disease, heart complications, or stroke) compared with people who did not receive text messages. Two studies reported non-fatal cardiovascular events, with neither study finding evidence of difference between groups. Only one study reported combined cardiovascular events, and found no evidence of a difference between groups. Our confidence in the evidence is low to very low. Three main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, the research methods that the studies used were not of the best quality. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Also, not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. Secondly, the content and delivery method of text messages differed across studies. Thirdly, results were very inconsistent across the different studies, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to August 2023.
We looked for high quality randomised trials (RCTs) and before-and-after studies with cerivastatin in different dose sizes . The trials were between three and twelve weeks long. People of any age and gender, either with or without heart disease were in these trials.
Participants could be of any age and gender, with or without cardiovascular disease. We found fifty trials with 13,018 participants who had their lipid levels measured. 12,877 participants had their LDL cholesterol measured.
People taking 0.025 to 0.8 mg of cerivastatin per day lowered their LDL cholesterol by 12% to 42%. The higher the dose, the lower the levels of three measures of cholesterol. HDL cholesterol increased by 5%.
For lowering LDL cholesterol, cerivastatin is 250-times stronger than fluvastatin, 20-times stronger than atorvastatin and 5.5 times stronger than rosuvastatin.
Only 11 of the 19 RCTs reported the number of people who dropped out of the studies because of adverse effects. The level of drop outs due to adverse effects were similar in the people who took cerivastatin and placebo. There is a high level of trust around the results  for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and very low to moderate for triglycerides. We have a low level of trust in the evidence around drop outs because many (8 out of 19 trials) did not report drop outs due to adverse effects.
Four studies based in west Africa were included in the review; two small studies in Ghana and Liberia and two larger community-based ones in Nigeria and Sierra-Leone. In the smaller studies, people with onchocercal infection were given one dose of ivermectin or placebo and followed up for one year. In the larger studies all individuals in selected communities were treated every six or 12 months with ivermectin or placebo, whether or not they were infected, and followed for two to three years. This review found that ivermectin can prevent damage to the front of the eye but its effectiveness in preventing blindness remains uncertain.
The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine for initial treatment of HIV infection. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the triple drug combination. We identified 15 potentially eligible studies, four of which met our inclusion criteria. Our findings indicate that co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine remains a viable option for initiating antiretroviral therapy, especially in HIV-infected patients with pre-existing hyperlipidaemia and those who do not tolerate ritonavir.
We found 29 studies:
13 studies (in 54,471 people) took place in child day-care centres or schools in mainly high-income countries;
15 studies (in 29,347 people) were community-based in low- to middle-income countries; and
1 study (in 148 people) was hospital-based.
The studies looked at the effects of hand-washing programmes on the number of times people in the study reported having diarrhoea. The effects of the programmes were followed for four months to one year.
No studies reported the effects of hand-washing programmes on how many people died from diarrhoea, how many children under five years of age died (of any cause), or whether the benefits associated with the programme outweighed any extra costs. All studies compared the effects of programmes to encourage hand washing with not having any programmes about hand washing.
In child-care centres and schools: in high-income countries, encouraging hand washing reduced the number of times children had diarrhoea (9 studies, 4664 children); and in low- to middle-income countries may have reduced the number of times children had diarrhoea (2 studies, 45,380 children).
In communities in low- to middle-income countries, encouraging hand washing probably reduced the number of times children (up to 15 years of age) had diarrhoea (9 studies,; 15,950 children).
In hospitalized adults with AIDS, encouraging hand washing probably reduced the number of times they had diarrhoea and probably improved hand-washing behaviour (washing hands more often) over one year of follow-up (1 study, 148 people). We are confident that, in high-income countries, hand-washing programmes in schools and child-care centres reduced the number of times children had diarrhoea. This result is unlikely to change with more evidence. We are less confident about our result for low- to middle-income countries, which is based on a small number of studies and might or might not change with more evidence.
We are moderately confident about our results for children in communities and in hospitalized adults with AIDS. These results might change if more evidence becomes available.
We found five eligible trials by the date of this updated review (search date March 2017). These trials included 3427 patients adult patients (16 to 65 years of age). For this updated review there are new data available resulting in a benefit in terms of overall survival (OS) for people with early unfavourable and advanced HL receiving BEACOPP escalated for first-line treatment. Furthermore, the analysis shows a better chance of avoiding recurrence of the tumour in patients who received chemotherapy including BEACOPP escalated.
We analysed the following harms potentially caused by both regimens. There is no evidence for a difference for treatment-related mortality.
There is evidence for a higher risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in patients receiving BEACOPP escalated, but the total number of secondary malignancies does not show evidence for a difference between both treatment groups. However, the observation time of the studies included in the review is too short to be expected to demonstrate differences with respect to second solid tumours. We are very uncertain how many female patients will be infertile due to chemotherapy and which arm might be favoured, as the evaluated sample is very small. No data for male patients and risk for infertility was provided. Treatment with BEACOPP escalated caused a higher risk of adverse events such as anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and infections.
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials. One trial stated it would assess quality of life, however, there were no results reported. We assessed the quality of the evidence as high relating to overall survival, as moderate for progression-free survival and as low for secondary AML or MDS, secondary malignancies and treatment-related mortality and adverse events. The quality of evidence is very low for infertility.
Our pooled analysis of randomised trials of 4 weeks or more in duration shows that such a reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure both in individuals with raised blood pressure and in those with normal blood pressure. The fall in blood pressure is shown in both whites and blacks, men and women. Additionally, our results show that a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake has no adverse effect on hormone and lipid levels. These findings provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population blood pressure and reduce strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the fact that the lower the salt intake, the lower the blood pressure. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake to 5-6 grams per day will lower blood pressure, but a further reduction to 3 grams per day will lower blood pressure more. Therefore, 3 grams per day should become the long-term target for population salt intake.
We found 19 studies, including 13,216 participants. Our results are presented along with a judgement of quality which reflects how certain we are about the results. We found that follow-up did not improve overall survival (high-quality evidence), colorectal cancer-specific survival (moderate-quality evidence), or relapse-free survival (high-quality evidence). If patients have follow-up, they are much more likely to have surgery if the cancer is detected again (high-quality evidence). With follow-up, more asymptomatic 'silent' cancer relapses are likely to be found at planned visits (moderate-quality evidence). Harmful side effects (harms) from tests were not common, but more intensive follow-up may increase harms (reported in two studies; very low-quality evidence). Costs may be increased with more intensive follow-up (low-quality evidence). More intensive follow-up probably makes little or no difference for quality of life (moderate-quality evidence). The information we have now suggests that there is little benefit from intensifying follow-up, but there is also little evidence about quality of life, harms, and costs. We do not know what is the best way to follow patients treated for non-metastatic (no secondaries) colorectal cancer, or if we should at all. We know little about the costs of follow-up in this setting. Consumer needs and concerns with respect to the value of follow-up require further research.
The benefits of PN are uncertain as the evidence is of very low certainty, provided mainly by studies that only looked at people who received PN rather than comparing patients who received PN with those who did not. As we found no randomised controlled trials, we have included the results from 13 observational studies with a total of 721 participants. For 12 of the studies, there was only one relevant treatment group and no control group. Therefore, the results are only for people receiving PN and we have no information about those not receiving it. The average survival time for people on PN varied from three to 1278 days. Only three studies measured quality of life using a recognised measure. One study found quality of life improved and two studies found similar numbers of people both improved and deteriorated. However, the three studies monitored quality of life at different points in time and measured it in different ways. Side effects occurred in 12% of people in the eight studies that measured them. Further research is needed to find out if PN is of benefit to people with an inoperable blockage of the bowel caused by advanced cancer.
The database searches, up-to-date to February 2019, found 13 randomised controlled trials (a type of experiment in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). Three studies comprised 890 adult participants; a further 10 studies comprised 6402 infants and children.
Nine studies were conducted in middle-income countries; three studies in high-income countries; and one study in a low-income country. The studies had a duration of 2 to 19 months. Three studies were supported financially by drug companies, and three studies received the vaccines from the pharmaceutical company. There is overall limited confidence in the quality of the included studies since, for example, in most trials the recipient or assessor (or both) were aware of the vaccine being given. The review included 13 studies with a total of 7292 participants (6402 children and 890 adults). Where possible, we combined the results of similar studies in a meta-analysis (a statistical method of combining the results of multiple single studies to calculate an overall effect).
There are three types of wild poliovirus: types 1, 2, and 3. We found that the number of antibody responses to the vaccine (measured using something called seroconversion rates) in children was higher in the group that received the vaccine by intramuscular injection compared to the group that had a similar number of injections given intradermally, after one single dose (6 studies, 2571 children) and two doses (3 studies, 981 children) for all three types of poliovirus, and after three doses for type 2 poliovirus (3 studies, 973 children).
The vaccines produce antibodies against all three types of poliovirus. The quantity of antibodies produced by the vaccines (measured as geometric median titres) was higher in children receiving a full dose of IPV via intramuscular route for all three types of poliovirus (7 studies, 4887 children).
Five studies (2217 children) reported more adverse events, such as fever and redness, in the intradermal group, whilst two studies (1904 children) reported more adverse events in the intramuscular group.
None of the included studies reported data on the occurrence of paralytic poliomyelitis. Based on the evidence, intramuscular full-dose IPV may result in a slight increase in seroconversion rates for all three types of wild poliovirus when compared with intradermal fractional-dose IPV. We are uncertain if a fractional dose of IPV given intradermally is better than a full dose of IPV given intramuscularly at producing antibodies for all three types of poliovirus or reducing adverse effects.
We found two studies (specifically, studies in which 'chance' decided what treatment men got), with a total of 2201 men. The studies compared abiraterone acetate and hormone therapy to hormone therapy alone. In one of the studies, most of the included men had high risk prostate cancer, and had previously undergone local treatment. In the other study, most men had not had previous treatment to their prostate. The evidence is current to 15 May 2020. Adding abiraterone acetate to hormone therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It probably improves cancer-specific survival and reduces disease progression. However, there is also an increase in severe and life-threatening side effects, likely leading to discontinued treatment, with the addition of abiraterone acetate. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for overall survival (time to death from any cause), and severe and life-threatening side effects. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect for these outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for quality of life, cancer-specific survival (time to death from prostate cancer), time to disease progression, and discontinued treatment due to adverse events. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect, but there were some limitations in the studies that reduced our confidence in the results.
We examined the evidence from 14 studies with 2616 participants with CKD not receiving dialysis published before 12 September 2016 to determine whether differences in improvement in anaemia and in side effects existed between different short-acting epoetins or between the same epoetins given at different frequencies. We did not find any studies using different frequencies of epoetins in children.
We found that the traditionally shorter acting epoetins given less often (two weekly to every four weeks) resulted in similar correction of anaemia compared with administration every week or every two weeks; there were no differences in side effects between the different comparisons. One study comparing subcutaneous administration of a newly manufactured HX575 epoetin alpha compared with epoetin alpha was discontinued after two patients developed anti-erythropoietin antibodies. However more studies are required as most studies were small and poorly designed, which limits their application to the care of patients.
We searched the medical literature comprehensively, finding two completed trials. Only brief reports (abstracts) of these trials are available. The participants were children aged from five to 15 years with DMD who were able to walk and not able to walk. The treatments were risedronate versus no treatment in one trial (with 13 participants) and whole-body vibration versus a placebo (inactive) device in the other (with 21 participants). We found two completed studies that were potentially eligible for this review, for which full results have not yet been published, and two studies ongoing at the time of the search. These studies are looking at the effects of whole-body vibration (two studies), risedronate, and zoledronic acid. Both completed trials, presented as abstracts only, reported an improvement in bone mineral density in children who received active treatment and no improvement in children in the control (placebo or no treatment) groups. However, the reports did not report results for the comparison of treatment versus control groups, which means that it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of either treatment. All children tolerated whole-body vibration treatment. Neither study provided information on adverse events.
We know of no evidence from randomised clinical trials to guide use of treatments to prevent or treat osteoporosis and prevent fragility fractures in people with DMD taking corticosteroids.
Searches are current to September 2016.
We wanted to find out if bronchodilators can reduce the risk of:
• death or chronic lung disease; or
• lead to unwanted effects, including low potassium levels, fast heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms, tremor, high blood pressure and high sugar levels; or
• lead to pneumothorax (collapsed lung). We searched for studies that looked at bronchodilators in babies born too early. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the reliability of the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included two studies in our review, but one of them did not report any of our outcomes of interest. In the other study, 173 preterm newborns at risk of chronic lung disease were treated with salbutamol, a bronchodilator, or placebo.
Salbutamol may make little to no difference to death and chronic lung disease compared to placebo. It is unclear if salbutamol has an effect on the risk of pneumothorax. The salbutamol in this study was given at a dose of 200 micrograms every 4 hours, for 28 days.
The study did not report on any possible adverse effects of salbutamol.
There are no ongoing studies on the effects of bronchodilators on preterm babies. We are not confident in the evidence on death and chronic lung disease because full results were available for only one study. The evidence is up-to-date as of May 2023.
One single study showed some benefit of short-course inhaled antibiotics over placebo, in terms of microbiological response and subjective improvement in medical condition, although this was balanced against an increase in adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance in the treatment group. Given the potential benefits of shorter duration antibiotic therapy in bronchiectasis, further RCTs are clearly needed to answer this important question.
The objective of this review was to assess whether any form of psychotherapy is effective in the management of people suffering from hypochondriasis. Six studies were included in the review. Analysis of data suggested that, compared to being on a waiting list, forms of cognitive and behaviour therapy, or a non-specific therapy called behavioural stress management all improve the symptoms of hypochondriasis. However, the numbers of people in the studies were small and it was not possible to tell how much of an improvement each therapy made. It is possible that the improvements seen were due to non-specific factors involved in regular contact with a therapist rather than specific properties of these forms of psychotherapy. It was also not possible to make comparisons between the different types of psychotherapy. A study of psychoeducation was not considered to be sufficient evidence that this form of psychotherapy is effective.
This review of 49 trials found that treating children with a short course (less than seven days) of antibiotics, compared to treatment with a long course (seven days or greater) of antibiotics, increases the likelihood of treatment failure in the short term. No differences are seen one month later. The amount of gastrointestinal adverse events decreased with a shorter course of antibiotics.
We first searched the literature in 2004 and most recently in September 2014, finding 6 studies in total. All studies included patients with heart attack and some also included patients with severe angina. The dose of hyperbaric oxygen was similar in most studies. Overall, we found some evidence that people with ACS are less likely to die or to have major adverse events, and to have more rapid relief from their pain if they receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy as part of their treatment. However, our conclusions are based on relatively small randomised trials. Our confidence in these findings is further reduced because in most of these studies both the patients and researchers were aware of who was receiving HBOT and it is possible a 'placebo effect' has biased the result in favour of HBOT. HBOT was generally well-tolerated. Some patients complained of claustrophobia when treated in small (single person) chambers and there was no evidence of important toxicity from oxygen breathing in any subject. One individual suffered damage to the eardrum from pressurisation. While HBOT may reduce the risk of dying, time to pain relief and the chance of adverse heart events in people with heart attack and unstable angina, more work is needed to be sure that HBOT should be recommended.
We carried out the latest search for studies in July 2018. We found 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3932 participants. All studies were published between 2001 and 2015. Nine studies were of continuous antibiotics, two studies were of intermittent antibiotic prophylaxis and two were of pulsed antibiotics. The final study included one continuous, one intermittent, one pulsed and one placebo arm. The antibiotics investigated were azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, doxycycline and moxifloxacin. On average, the people involved in the studies were 65 to 72 years old and had moderate or severe COPD. Three studies included participants with frequent exacerbations and two of the studies recruited participants requiring steroid tablets or antibiotics or both, or who were at the end stage of their disease and required oxygen. One study only included people with a particular complication of COPD, involving the heart and blood vessels in the lungs (known as pulmonary hypertension). We found that, with the use of antibiotics, the number of participants who developed an exacerbation reduced markedly. For every eight participants treated, one person would be prevented from suffering an exacerbation. However, not all the antibiotic regimens had the same impact on exacerbations. The results suggested that antibiotics given at least three times per week may be more effective than antibiotics given daily for a few days followed by a break of several weeks. We also found there may have been a benefit on patient-reported quality of life with the antibiotics. On the other hand, use of antibiotics did not significantly affect the number of deaths due to any cause, the frequency of hospitalisation, or the loss of lung function during the study period.
Even though there may be fewer exacerbations with antibiotics, there are considerable drawbacks of taking antibiotics. First, there were specific adverse events associated with the antibiotics, which differed according to the antibiotic used; second, patients have to take antibiotics regularly for months or years; finally, the resulting increase in antibiotic resistance will have implications for both individual patients and the wider community through reducing the effectiveness of currently available antibiotics.
Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance and specific adverse effects, consideration of prophylactic antibiotic use should be mindful of the balance between benefits to individual patients and the potential harms to society created by antibiotic overuse.
We included seven trials involving 800 women. None of the included studies reported any maternal mortality. We did not combine the results of the trials because the trials were very different in the clinical interventions used and how the outcomes were assessed. One study reported higher maternal satisfaction with the use of general anaesthesia than sedation and analgesia. Paracervical block did not improve the control of postoperative pain when compared against sedation and analgesia. More nausea and vomiting were reported when opioid drugs were used.
Currently, the levels of postoperative pain experienced by women undergoing surgical evacuation of incomplete miscarriage are not completely relieved. Further studies in this context should be conducted to address this question. Key factors that influence the choice of anaesthesia include availability, effectiveness, safety, side effects, and costs. Other factors include patient preference, practitioner choice, facility resources and medical indications.
Several trials have addressed the effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease. This systematic review could not demonstrate any significant effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids on mortality, liver-related mortality, liver complications, and histology of patients with alcoholic liver disease. Anabolic-androgenic steroid intervention is not associated with a significant increase in non-serious adverse events, but with the seldom occurrence of serious adverse events. Accordingly, there is no evidence supporting the use of anabolic-androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease, but further randomised clinical trials may be needed to settle the question.
We identified 41 randomized controlled trials comparing sugammadex with neostigmine that provided suitable data on efficacy and safety. All of these trials included adults undergoing surgery and involved a total of 4206 participants. Data indicate that sugammadex was 10.22 minutes (6.6 times) faster than neostigmine (1.96 vs 12.87 minutes) in reversing moderate induced paralysis. Sugammadex was 45.78 minutes (16.8 times) faster than neostigmine (2.9 vs 48.8 minutes) in reversing deep induced paralysis. Participants receiving sugammadex appeared to have a 40% reduced risk of experiencing harmful events than those given neostigmine. Statistically, eight persons can be treated with sugammadex as opposed to neostigmine to avoid one person experiencing a single random harmful event. The occurrence of serious harmful events was nearly non-existent and data show no differences between compared groups. Sugammadex is more efficient and safer than neostigmine for reversing moderate and deep induced paralysis. We consider our overall findings on benefits and harms to provide evidence of moderate quality in favour of sugammadex.
The review included two studies that lasted seven days with a total of 287 people. One study involved 253 people (aged approximately 22 years) with sickle cell disease and compared tinzaparin with placebo and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The other study was smaller with 34 participants (aged approximately 27 years) and compared dalteparin versus placebo. Tinzaparin reduced the number of days spent in hospital and reduced the pain (and the intensity of the pain) more rapidly. Two minor bleedings were reported in the tinzaparin group versus none in the placebo group. The data regarding the effectiveness of dalteparin were very limited and only addressed pain intensity, being more reduced by treatment with dalteparin than by placebo. These data are not sufficient to support the conclusion that low-molecular-weight heparins are effective in the treatment of vaso-occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease. Additional studies with different types of low-molecular-weight heparin used in different forms of sickle cell disease, are necessary to confirm or dismiss the results of this single study. Vaso-occlusive crises can be extremely debilitating and can have a significant impact on quality of life; therefore it is important to know whether low-molecular-weight heparins might serve as a useful treatment option with few side effects. The quality of the evidence for the majority of outcomes was very low, this had mainly to do with risk of bias of the studies (e.g. method of blinding unclear) or with small sample size of the studies.
We included 36 studies with 2999 people. Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with some as long as 12 months. Most trials involved adults, and two trials specifically included children.
Nineteen trials included those with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (inherited, unknown, due to connective tissue diseases). People who were given PDE5 inhibitors were compared with those not given PDE5 inhibitors. This review shows that when given PDE5 inhibitors, on average people walked 48 meters further in six minutes (8 trials, 880 people). They also improved their functional class (reducing the physical limitations associated with PH), and were less likely to die (high-certainty evidence). They were also more likely to have side effects, including headache, flushing and muscle aches.
Five trials included people with pulmonary hypertension due to left-heart disease. This review shows that when given PDE5 inhibitors, these people were on average able to walk 34 metres further in six minutes (3 trials, 284 people; low-certainty evidence). However, there was no difference in survival, compared to those who were not given PDE5 inhibitors. Five trials included people with pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease (mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and some idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). When given PDE5 inhibitors, they were able to walk 27 meters further in six minutes (low-certainty evidence), but with no difference in survival, compared to those who were not given PDE5 inhibitors. Three trials included people with pulmonary hypertension due to blood clots; there was no significant difference in outcomes for those who used PDE5 inhibitors compared to those who did not. There was good-quality evidence for those with pulmonary arterial hypertension, giving us some confidence that the results are correct. The evidence for those with pulmonary hypertension due to heart disease was less certain. The quality of evidence in this group was low because there were few trials, small numbers of people taking part, and the trials were quite different from each other, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.
This review concerns the efficacy of single session psychological "debriefing" in reducing psychological distress and preventing the development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after traumatic events. Psychological debriefing is either equivalent to, or worse than, control or educational interventions in preventing or reducing the severity of PTSD, depression, anxiety and general psychological morbidity. There is some suggestion that it may increase the risk of PTSD and depression. The routine use of single session debriefing given to non selected trauma victims is not supported. No evidence has been found that this procedure is effective.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing slow versus faster rates of increase in the amount of milk fed to newborn infants who were very preterm or very low birth weight. We included 14 trials involving a total of 4033 infants (2804 infants participated in one large trial). The search is up-to-date as of October 2020. Combined analysis of the included trials showed that slow advancement of enteral feed volumes probably does not affect the risk of necrotising enterocolitis or death (moderate-certainty evidence). Slowly advancing enteral feed volumes probably does not reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis or death before hospital discharge for very preterm or very low birth weight infants.
We wanted to find out which surgical approach improves vision the most, or causes the fewest complications, or both, in children aged 2 years and under. We searched for trials that looked at different surgical approaches in children aged 2 years and under. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found three trials that involved 90 children with bilateral congenital cataracts; of which 79 children were under the age of 2 years. The childen were followed up for 1 to 5 years after surgery. All three trials were conducted in India and compared different interventions.
One study (60 children) compared implanting an intraocular lens during surgery with leaving the eye without a lens and managing the child's vision with a combination of spectacles and contact lenses. It reported no difference in the resulting vision or postoperative complications between the two groups.
One study (7 children under 2 years old) compared two surgical techniques for inserting an intraocular lens that can reduce the rate of reclouding of vision. They found no significant difference in their effectiveness, but they studied very few children.
One study (12 children) used a smaller instrument to remove the cataract and compared two routes of removal: an anterior  approach (in front of the lens) and a posterior approach (behind the lens). The study reported no reclouding using either route and no significant difference in complication rates. Our confidence in the evidence is very low because we found only a few trials, and they differed from each other. The three trials we included used different methods and measured different outcomes. The trials had a small number of participants and were all based in India. This means their results may not be applicable globally.
Study limitations include that one study (60 children) reported low compliance with the use of contact lenses after surgery. The other 2 studies (12 and 7 children respectively) did not specify in their methods all the outcomes they were going to measure, which means that their reporting may have been biased. Participants and outcome assessors were also not masked in these studies. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to 25 January 2022.
The evidence is up to date as of June 2016. We found 37 studies involving a total of 4129 people. Most of the people in the studies were aged over 65. There was a mix of new and experienced hearing aid users. Seven studies funded by the United States Veterans Association dominate the evidence. The 1297 people in these studies were serving in the military or military veterans. All but two of the other studies included fewer than 100 people in each study. Thirty-three of the 37 studies looked at ways to help someone to manage their hearing loss and hearing aid(s) better by giving information, practice and experience at listening/communicating or by asking people to practise tasks at home. These are forms of self-management support. Most of these studies also changed how the self-management support was provided, for example by changing the number of appointment sessions or using telephone or email follow-up.
Six studies looked at the effect of just changing how the service was delivered. No studies looked at the effect of using guidelines or standards, computerised medical record systems, community resources or changing the health system.
We found no evidence that the interventions helped people to wear their hearing aids for more hours per day over the short, medium or long term. One study that used interactive videos to give information after hearing aid fitting encouraged more people to wear their hearing aids.
We found no evidence of adverse effects of any of the interventions, but it was rare for studies to look for adverse effects.
Giving self-management support meant that people reported less hearing handicap and improved verbal communication over the short term. When this was combined with changing how the support was delivered people also reported slightly more hearing aid benefit over the long term.
Only six studies (287 people) looked at how people were doing after a year or more. Complex interventions that deliver self-management support in different ways improve some outcomes for some people with hearing loss who use hearing aids. We found no interventions that increased self-reported daily hours of hearing aid use. Few studies measured how many people use hearing aids compared to how many are fitted (adherence). Many things that might increase daily hours of hearing aid use or encourage more people to wear the hearing aids they have been fitted with have not been tested. It was difficult to combine data across different studies because many outcome measures were used and results were not always fully reported. In future it would be helpful if researchers:
- used existing guidelines for presenting their results;
- agreed a set of outcome measures for use in this type of study; and
- focused on long-term outcomes where people are followed up for at least a year. We judged the evidence to be of very low or low quality. There was risk of bias in the way many of the studies were carried out or reported. The largest studies included only military veterans. We do not know whether studies would find the same results in more mixed populations. Most of the other studies had small sample sizes. Very few studies measured long-term outcomes.
We searched medical databases and trials registries in December 2014. We wanted to include studies in which receiving one surgical treatment or another surgical treatment was decided by chance. This research method, termed a randomised controlled trial (RCT), is the best way to ensure that any measured improvement is caused by the treatment itself and no other factors. We found three RCTs involving 213 adults (with results available from 173) that compared nailing versus plating for treating distal tibial fractures. Overall the studies included around twice as many males as females and the average age of the study participants was just over 40 years. We found no trials comparing surgery with non-surgical treatment. We found no clear differences between the nailing and plating groups in terms of patient-reported functional outcomes, re-operations for adverse outcomes, troublesome non-healing of the bone or deformity, pain, wound problems such as infection, or the numbers of individuals with healed fractures. Only three trials were identified and the sample sizes were small, so the results are imprecise. Moreover, the results of one trial were very likely to be biased due to flawed methodology. We therefore judged the overall quality of evidence to be very low, which means that we are very unsure of these results. Overall, the evidence is of very low quality and is insufficient to draw definite conclusions about the best method of surgery, including nailing versus plating, for treating breaks of the lower end of the shin bone in adults. Future updates of this review are likely to include evidence from currently ongoing research comparing nailing versus plating. Although other RCTs are needed to address key clinical questions on surgical methods for treating these fractures, these studies should be preceded by research to determine which questions should be prioritised.
In January 2016, we found seven studies that assessed liposomal bupivacaine nerve block. Three studies were listed as completed but had not reported results. This left four studies involving 299 participants for this review. Two studies investigated liposomal bupivacaine given between two of the layers of abdominal muscles to block the nerves supplying sensation to that area (known as a transversus abdominus plane (TAP) block); one study investigated liposomal bupivacaine given around the nerves that supply sensation to the penis (dorsal penile nerve block); and one study investigated the ankle (ankle block).
We did not identify any studies that reported our primary outcome cumulative pain score between 0 and 72 hours or pain-centred secondary outcomes. Two studies reported cumulative opioid (a strong painkiller) use with inconsistent results. We looked for results about side effects but none were reported, however no participants dropped out of the studies due to side effects. Overall, the lack of evidence, due to the small number of trials each reporting different outcomes, prevented a full assessment of the role of liposomal bupivacaine administered as a nerve block for the management of pain after surgery in adults. Due to the small number of trials, and small number of participants in these trials, the quality of evidence was very low. As such, further research is required to evaluate the role of liposomal bupivacaine as a nerve block to treat pain after surgery.
We included 138 randomised clinical trials. All included trials were at high risk of bias. The 138 trials used 51 different DAAs. Of these, 84 trials assessed DAAs on the market or under development; 57 trials were on DAAs withdrawn from development or the market. Trials were conducted from 2004 to 2016. The trials were from all over the world including 34 different countries. We included 17 trials where all the participants had previously been treated for hepatitis C (treatment-experienced) before being included in the trial. There were 95 trials that included only participants who had not been previously treated for hepatitis C (treatment-naive). The intervention periods ranged from one day to 48 weeks with an average of 14 weeks. The combined intervention period and follow-up period ranged from one day to 120 weeks with an average of 34 weeks. We could not reliably determine the effect of DAAs on hepatitis C-related morbidity or death from any cause. There were no data on hepatitis C-related morbidity and very few deaths occurred over the course of the trials (15 deaths/2377 direct-acting antiviral participants (0.63%) versus 1 death/617 control participants (0.16%), very low quality evidence). Based on very low quality evidence, 5.2% people treated with DAAs had one or more serious adverse events versus 5.6% participants who were untreated during the observation period. When analysed separately, simeprevir was the only direct-acting antiviral that showed evidence of a beneficial effect when assessing risk of a serious adverse event. Our analyses, however, showed that the validity of this result is questionable and that 'play of chance' might be the cause for the difference. There was not enough information to determine if there was any effect of DAAs on other clinically relevant outcomes. Our results confirm that DAAs seem to reduce the number of people who have the hepatitis C virus in their blood from 54.1% in untreated people to 23.8% in those who were treated. Because the loss of detectable hepatitis C virus in the blood stream is only a blood test, the studies could not tell what this result means in the long term. Due to several limitations (e.g. lack of blinding, lack of relevant data, missing data, no published protocol) we assessed the quality of the evidence in this review as very low or low quality. First, all trials and outcome results were at high risk of bias, which means that our results presumably overestimate the beneficial effects of DAAs and underestimate any potential harmful effects. Second, there were limited data on most of our clinical outcomes, that is, there were only relevant clinical data for meta-analyses on all-cause mortality and serious adverse events, and for these, data were sparse. There are no long-term trials that have assessed whether or not DAA treatment improves morbidity or mortality.
Six randomised controlled studies of the effect of oxatomide were identified. All studies compared oxatomide with placebo. Two studies showed significant improvement with oxatomide as judged subjectively by the doctor. There was significant difference shown between oxatomide and placebo on objective outcomes (outcomes that are not influenced by people's opinions such as lung function or the amount of regular asthma medication taken by participants during the course of the study). Adverse effects were the only outcome able to be combined in a meta-analysis, and these were significantly more likely with oxatomide than with placebo treatment.
We included nine randomised studies (1104 adults and children with SCD (HbSS, HbSC or HbSβºthal genotypes)). Studies lasted from six to 30 months. In five studies, 784 adults and children with SCD were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea or placebo. In two studies, 254 children with SCD, who were also at an increased risk of having a first or second stroke, were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea and phlebotomy (collection of blood) or blood transfusion and chelation (administration of agents to remove excess iron from the body). These seven studies only recruited people with HbSS or HbSβºthal genotypes so the results do not apply to people with the HbSC genotype.
There was moderate-quality evidence from these seven studies that hydroxyurea may reduce the frequency of pain crises, may increase HbF and may decrease neutrophil (white blood cell) counts compared to the comparator treatment. We found no difference between people receiving hydroxyurea or other treatments in terms of quality of life, deaths during the studies and adverse effects (including serious and life-threatening effects). However, there is less information about these outcomes in the studies, so the quality of this evidence is low.
Two further studies were included in the review. In one study, 22 children with SCD, who were also at increased risk of having a stroke, were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea or no treatment (observation only) and in one study 44 adults and children were randomly selected to receive treatments with or without adding hydroxyurea. In both studies we are unsure if hydroxyurea led to an increase in HbF compared to the comparator treatment. There were no deaths during the studies. There was no difference between people receiving hydroxyurea or other treatments in terms of pain crises and adverse effects (including serious or life-threatening effects) and neither study measured quality of life. The quality of the evidence from these studies is very low, given the studies were very small and only recruited around 20% of the intended number of people, and the results do not apply to all people with SCD (different genotypes). The evidence shows that hydroxyurea is likely to be effective in the short term at decreasing the frequency of painful episodes and raising HbF levels in the blood in people with SCD. Hydroxyurea is also likely to be effective in preventing first strokes for those at an increased risk of stroke and does not seem to be associated with an increase in any adverse effects (including serious and life-threatening effects).
There is currently little evidence from the studies that we examined on whether hydroxyurea is beneficial over a long period of time, what the best dose to take is, or whether treatment causes any long-term or serious side effects. More studies are needed to answer these questions.
We found seven studies in 1773 people who had had an acute ischaemic stroke. The studies looked at the effect of giving Cerebrolysin alongside medicines to prevent and dissolve blood clots (standard therapy) during the first 48 hours after a stroke. The studies compared this treatment with standard therapy alone or standard therapy plus a dummy treatment (placebo).
The studies were conducted in hospitals in Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, China, Hong Kong, Iran, Myanmar, and South Korea, and lasted from 28 days to 90 days. Adding Cerebrolysin or a Cerebrolysin-like agent, Cortexin, to standard therapy probably adds no benefit to the risk of dying from any cause after a stroke (6 studies, 1689 people).
We did not find enough evidence about how Cerebrolysin or the Cerebrolysin-like agent Cortexin affected:
• the risk of dying or needing continuing care at the end of the study;
• the risk of dying within two weeks of having a stroke;
• the time taken for people to be able to go back to work; or
• people's well-being (quality of life).
We are uncertain whether adding Cerebrolysin to standard therapy made any difference to the numbers of people who dropped out of studies (6 studies, 1689 people).
Cerebrolysin added to standard therapy probably made little or no difference to:
• the total number of people who had serious unwanted effects (life-threatening effects that could result in death, disability, or a longer hospital stay) (3 studies, 1335 people);
• the number of serious unwanted effects that caused death (3 studies, 1335 people).
However, more people given Cerebrolysin plus standard therapy probably had serious unwanted effects that did not kill them than those who were given standard therapy (alone or with placebo) (3 studies, 1335 people).
Cerebrolysin or the Cerebrolysin-like agent Cortexin may make little or no difference to the total number of people who had any unwanted effects (4 studies, 1607 people). We are moderately confident (certain) in the results of this review. However, the evidence comes from a small number of studies. Three studies involved a pharmaceutical company that makes Cerebrolysin, which may have affected how those studies were designed, carried out, and reported. Our conclusions are likely to change if results from further studies become available. Adding Cerebrolysin or a Cerebrolysin-like agent, Cortexin, to standard therapy after an acute ischaemic stroke probably:
• does not reduce the risk of dying.
Adding Cerebrolysin to standard therapy after an ischaemic stroke probably:
• does not affect how many people have serious unwanted effects overall; but
• increases the number of people with serious, non-fatal unwanted effects.
This systematic review of five randomised trial shows higher rates of clinical relief of obstruction in emergency surgery. Colonic stent has not been shown to be as effective as emergency surgery in malignant colorectal obstructions. However, use of colonic stent is associated with comparable mortality and morbidity with advantage of shorter hospital stay and procedure time and less blood loss. Further randomised controlled trials with larger sample size and robust trial design are required on this topic.
Amongst the six studies comparing immunosuppressant with placebo, one study, investigating intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), showed statistically significant improvement in scores of muscle strength in the IVIg group over three months. Another study investigating etanercept showed some evidence of a longer median time to relapse in the etanercept group, a secondary outcome in this review, but no improvement in other assessed outcomes. The other four randomised placebo-controlled trials assessed either plasma exchange and leukapheresis, eculizumab, infliximab or azathioprine against placebo and all produced negative results.
Three of the four studies comparing two immunosuppressant regimes (azathioprine with methotrexate, ciclosporin with methotrexate, and intramuscular methotrexate with oral methotrexate plus azathioprine) showed no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the treatment regimes. The fourth study comparing pulsed oral dexamethasone with daily oral prednisolone and found that the dexamethasone regime had a shorter median time to relapse but fewer side effects.
Most of the studies were small (the largest had 62 participants) and many of the reports contained insufficient information to assess risk of bias. Immunosuppressants were associated with significant side effects. The small number of RCTs of immunosuppressants and immunomodulatory therapies are inadequate to decide whether these agents are beneficial in dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Two small trials, one of IVIg in dermatomyositis, the other of etanercept in dermatomyositis suggested that they are beneficial. More RCTs are needed.
We searched the literature up to 19 June 2015 and found four studies (N = 238 participants) for this review. The studies evaluated four different types of educational interventions, all targeting adolescents with different clinical conditions. All sought to improve knowledge and self-management skills of adolescents in preparation for transition to adult care. Three of the transitional-care programmes found that the intervention may slightly improve transitional readiness in young people, enabling them to better self-manage and adjust to using adult health services. One transitional-care programme that evaluated a two-day workshop for young people with spina bifida found little or no difference in measures of transitional readiness. Transitional-care programmes may slightly improve a young persons knowledge of their condition and their own appropriate use of health services. Transitional-care programmes led to little or no difference in health status, quality of life or well-being, or rates of transfer from child to adult health services. While there is a wide range of transition programmes that are being developed in different countries, often within particular clinical specialties, this review only identified four small studies that provided low certainty evidence about educational interventions targeting participating adolescents, and no studies of interventions that targeted the organisation of care (for example, joint clinics or provision of a key worker). Other limitations with the evidence are the small number of adolescents recruited, the limited number of clinical conditions studied, the short follow up (12 months or less), and the fact that only two of the included studies reported on the primary outcome (that is, condition-specific clinical outcomes). Despite the challenges in designing studies that can test these types of interventions, such as evaluating a complex intervention, a stronger evidence base is needed to inform the development of these services.
This systematic review found that people who received Supported Employment were significantly more likely to be in competitive employment than those who received Pre-vocational Training (at 12 months 34% employed in Supported Employment compared with 12% in Pre-vocational Training).
We found eight studies that met the requirements to be included in this review. Two studies compared resistance exercise training with usual care or no exercise training, three studies compared resistance exercise training with another type of resistance exercise training, two studies compared a multimodal exercise training (several different exercises) with usual care or no exercise training, and one study compared the same multimodal exercise training program undertaken for 7 and 14 weeks.
We are very uncertain about the effects of exercise training for any of our outcomes. While some studies reported improvement in the distance walked over 6 minutes (exercise versus no exercise, different exercise programs) muscle strength (exercise or multimodal exercise versus no exercise) and bone mineral density (exercise versus no exercise), most reported no differences in adverse events, quality of life, pulmonary function, or the risk of death.
The quality of evidence of the included studies was very low. Participants and study personnel were not blinded to the treatment they received due to the nature of the physical interventions and there was a frequent reporting bias. Besides, all estimates of results were imprecise mainly due to the small number of participants. In adults undergoing lung transplantation the evidence about the effects of exercise training is very uncertain in terms of maximal and functional exercise capacity, HRQoL and safety, due to very imprecise estimates of effects and high risk of bias.
Our review included six randomised control trials (RCTs) that involved 544 participants. Five RCTs compared FAE with placebo, and one compared FAE with methotrexate. The outcomes we were interested in measuring were the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which is a psoriasis severity score, and the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse (side) effects that are common but sufficiently serious that the drug had to be stopped, such as severe diarrhoea, infections, or cutaneous malignancy. It was difficult to pool and compare results because outcome measures differed between the studies. Three studies reported significant benefit with FAE when compared with placebo after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment, but we could not combine these results in a statistical analysis to show the overall difference. The included studies did not fully examine the chance of discontinuing FAE treatment because of adverse effects, which is uncertain. One study showed that individuals on FAE are nearly five times more likely to develop nuisance adverse effects; the most common were diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, flushing, reversible protein loss in the urine, and raised levels of eosinophil blood cells. Two RCTs were similar enough to allow the combination of their results and found that FAE were better than placebo when measured by the proportion of individuals who experienced at least a 50% improvement in their psoriasis severity score. One study reported improvement of individuals' quality of life with FAE in comparison with placebo, but the significance of this difference could not be calculated. The benefit of FAE was similar to methotrexate after 12 weeks when changes in disease severity from the start to the end of the trial were compared. The number of individuals experiencing nuisance adverse effects with these two treatments was not significantly different. The included studies, which were too small and of limited duration to provide evidence about rare or delayed effects, reported no serious adverse effects of FAE. The risk of study bias, which means any factors that may systematically deviate away from the true findings, was unclear in most studies. This may be because most of the studies were conducted decades ago or were incompletely reported. Several analyses comparing FAE with placebo and methotrexate were limited because the studies were small or did not provide enough information to establish how these treatments compare with each other. Therefore, the overall quality of the evidence was low when comparing FAE with placebo and very low when comparing FAE with methotrexate.
Future RCTs should use standard psoriasis outcome measures, including a validated quality of life scale, to enable the comparison and combination of results. They should be longer in duration or have longer follow-up phases to provide evidence about any delayed adverse effects.
We have not found any trials to show the effectiveness and the risks of the procedure in people with Gaucher disease. We have not found any trials assessing the effectiveness and the risks of the procedure in people with Gaucher disease. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to January 2017. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published. We have not found any trials assessing the effectiveness and the risks of the procedure in people with Gaucher disease.
We wanted to find out whether antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements slow down the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and prevent visual loss. We searched for studies that compared antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements with placebo (a ‘dummy’ treatment not containing any supplements) or no treatment. We only looked at the effects of these supplements in people with AMD. There is another Cochrane Review on the effects of these supplements in people who do not already have AMD. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 26 studies from the USA, Europe, China, and Australia that enroled 11,952 people with AMD. These studies compared multivitamin supplements, zinc, vitamin E, lutein (with or without zeaxanthin) with placebo. Participants were aged 65 to 75 years and there were slightly more women than men in the studies. • Taking an antioxidant multivitamin supplement (AREDS formula containing vitamins E and C, beta-carotene plus zinc) probably slows down the progression of AMD to late AMD and vision loss. This may result in a small improvement in quality of life.
• People with intermediate AMD have a higher risk of progression to late AMD and so may be more likely to benefit from supplements (78 fewer cases of progression for every 1000 people taking supplements). People with early AMD have a low risk of progression and so may be less likely to benefit (4 fewer cases of progression to late AMD for every 1000 people taking supplements).
• Lutein with or without zeaxanthin may have little or no effect on progression to late AMD but may be a suitable replacement for beta-carotene in the AREDS formula. Beta-carotene may increase the chance of lung cancer in people who have smoked.
• The effects of vitamin E alone on the progression to late AMD and vision loss are uncertain.
Although vitamin supplements are generally regarded as safe, the studies included in this review did not provide good evidence about safety because most of the studies were small and reported on harmful effects inconsistently. Our confidence in the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. This is because most of the included studies were small, and they did not cover all the comparisons and outcomes we were interested in. This review updates our previous version. The evidence is up to date to 29 November 2022.
We wanted to know whether chest imaging is accurate enough to diagnose COVID-19 in people with suspected infection; we included studies in people with suspected COVID-19 only and excluded studies in people with confirmed COVID-19. We also wanted to assess the accuracy of chest imaging for screening asymptomatic people.
The evidence is up to date to 17 February 2021. X-rays or scans produce an image of the organs and structures in the chest.
- X-rays (radiography) use radiation to produce a 2-D image. Usually done in hospitals, using fixed equipment by a radiographer; they can also be done on portable machines.
- Computed tomography (CT) scans use a computer to merge 2-D X-ray images and convert them to a 3-D image. They require highly-specialized equipment and are done in hospital by a specialist radiographer.
- Ultrasound scans use high-frequency sound waves to produce an image. They can be done in hospitals or other healthcare settings, such as a doctor’s office. We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of chest imaging to diagnose COVID-19 in people of any age with suspected COVID-19. We included studies with ‘symptomatic' or 'mixed populations'. We found 94 studies with 37,631 participants (of whom 19,768 (53%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19) for evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging in the evaluation of people with suspected COVID-19. Eighty-seven studies evaluated one imaging modality, and seven studies evaluated two imaging modalities. All 94 studies used RT-PCR either alone or in combination with other criteria (such as clinical signs and symptoms, or positive contacts) as the reference standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Pooled results showed that chest CT (69 studies) correctly diagnosed COVID-19 in 87% of people who had COVID-19. However, it incorrectly identified COVID-19 in 21% of people who did not have COVID-19. Pooled results showed that chest X-ray (17 studies) correctly diagnosed COVID-19 in 73 % of people who had COVID-19. However, it incorrectly identified COVID-19 in 27% of people who did not have COVID-19. Pooled results showed that lung ultrasound (15 studies) correctly diagnosed COVID-19 in 87% of people with COVID-19. However, it incorrectly diagnosed COVID-19 in 24% of people who did not have COVID-19. We included 10 studies (7 CT, 1 X-ray, 2 ultrasound) with 3548 asymptomatic participants, of whom 364 (10%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19. Pooled results of seven studies, showed that CT correctly diagnosed COVID-19 in 56% of people who had COVID-19, and incorrectly identified COVID-19 in 8% of people who did not have COVID-19. The studies differed from each other and used different methods to report their results. Very few studies directly compared one type of imaging test with another. Also, the risk of bias was high or unclear in about half of all included studies. Therefore, it is difficult to draw confident conclusions. The evidence suggests that chest CT and ultrasound are better at ruling out COVID-19 infection than distinguishing it from other respiratory problems. So, their usefulness may be limited to excluding COVID-19 infection rather than differentiating it from other causes of lung infection. In addition, chest CT imaging had poor sensitivity and high specificity for detecting asymptomatic individuals.
The review authors identified only one controlled trial, from New Zealand. This trial randomised 167 women who were between 24 and 36 weeks' pregnant where ultrasound showed a small-for-gestational-age baby. They received a set combination of tests either twice-weekly or fortnightly. With more frequent testing, women were 25% more likely to have induced labour. Overall their babies were born four days earlier than in the fortnightly surveillance group where spontaneous onset of labour was more likely to occur. The mean gestational age at birth was just under 38 weeks in the twice-weekly group and just over 38 weeks in the fortnightly group, which was unlikely to have an impact on the health of the newborn. The number of caesarean sections, either for fetal distress or because of failure of induction, was no different. No information was available on length of antenatal hospital admission or operative vaginal births and infants were not followed up to determine neurodevelopment and cerebral palsy. This study excluded pregnancies with abnormal Doppler studies and disorders of the amniotic fluid. More studies are needed and the women’s views on the testing are also important.
We found no new studies in this update, so the review still includes 10 studies involving 1301 women. The studies were quite old, ranging from the 1970s to the early 1990s. All the studies looked at perineal pain relief associated with trauma, and no studies where the pain was associated with intact perineum were found. Overall, the evidence was of low quality due to the unclear methodology reported and the variation of findings.
Paracetamol may reduce the number of women experiencing pain at four hours after birth (10 trials, 1279 women), and fewer women may need additional pain relief with paracetamol (eight trials, 1132 women).
Only one study reported the number of women experiencing nausea (feeling sick) or sleepiness with no clear differences identified. There were no other side effects and none of the studies looked at effects on the babies. Paracetamol is generally effective as painkiller and causes few side effects. This review showed there may be some benefit specifically with a single dose of paracetamol for perineal pain after vaginal birth. Lactating women should be advised about the little information available on the effects of paracetamol in breastfed babies.
We searched the literature up to 10 September 2014 and tried to find all available research (published and unpublished) that compared these two types of defibrillators. We only included trials with a high-quality study design to avoid the possibility of inaccurate results. Four trials (552 participants) met the inclusion criteria of our review. Several included trials were potentially at risk of misleading results due to features of their study design. When we combined these trial results, we found that using the newer biphasic waveform defibrillators may be associated with lower failure rates of restarting a person's heart, but these results were imprecise. There was no difference in the number of people who were alive on arrival at the hospital or who were discharged from the hospital alive. No included trials reported on side effects or operator safety. We are uncertain as to whether biphasic defibrillators have an important effect on being able to restart a person's heart because the results were imprecise.
The evidence is current to February 2015. In this review one randomised controlled trial was identified that compared giving platelet transfusions at a low platelet count (25 x 109/l) versus giving platelet transfusions at a higher platelet count (50 x 109/l) prior to insertion of a central line to prevent bleeding. This trial is still recruiting and is due to complete recruitment in December 2017. There were no trials that compared no platelet transfusions versus giving platelet transfusions at a prespecified platelet count. There are no results from the one eligible study because it is still recruiting participants. This ongoing study (expected to recruit 165 participants) will be unable to provide sufficient data for this review's primary outcomes because major bleeding and mortality are uncommon. We would need to design a study with at least 4634 participants to be able to detect an increase in the number of people who had major bleeding from 1 in 100 to 2 in 100. There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to answer our review questions.
We conducted a thorough search of electronic databases, trial registers and conference proceedings up to July 2012. We included 11 studies in our analysis. The studies were moderate to good quality. Four studies (277 suspected fractures) looked at CT, five studies (221 suspected fractures) looked at MRI and six studies (543 suspected fractures) looked at BS. Four of these studies directly compared two modalities, such as both CT and MRI. When we compared the pooled data for the different imaging tests from all studies, we found that BS has the highest sensitivity, but specificity was lower than CT and MRI. All three imaging tests were found to be highly accurate for definitive diagnosis. CT and MRI were comparable in diagnostic accuracy (the correct diagnosis is made). Although BS had significantly better accuracy than CT and MRI, it could lead to more people receiving unnecessary treatment. Moreover, BS is an invasive technique and is believed to be inappropriate for use in some populations, especially children.
Future studies should focus on improving clinical evaluation to raise the prevalence of true fractures. In addition, more direct comparison studies could add valuable data to determine which modality is superior in diagnosis of suspected scaphoid fractures.
We included 39 studies covering 2483 women in the meta-analysis. EP was found to have the highest ability to correctly detect most conditions causing symptoms of obstructed defaecation; none of the other diagnostic tests met the criteria to replace EP. MRI and transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) met the criteria for a triage test. They are better able to correctly identify healthy patients than EP. This means that a positive test result suggests the presence of the disease, as the test rarely gives positive results in healthy women, and avoids further testing. The results of the other ultrasound techniques were of too low a quality of evidence to draw conclusions. In a population of women seeking help for their symptoms of obstructed defaecation, EP remains the test of choice. MRI and TPUS can be used for the initial assessment of women with obstructed defaecation as a screening test. TPUS or MRI could therefore potentially reduce the number of women having to undergo EP.
Overall 223 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer participated in four studies. The duration of the intervention (injections of recombinant human thyrotropin) was two days in all trials. Studies were of rather low quality. We found no statistically significant differences between recombinant human thyrotropin and thyroid hormone withdrawal treatment in terms of successful reduction of thyroid remnants or cancer cells but significant benefits in radiation exposure to blood and bone marrow. One trial reported on benefits in some domains of health-related quality of life. There were no deaths and no serious adverse effects observed, however maximum follow up was only 12 months. None of the included trials investigated complete or partial remission of metastatic tumour, secondary malignancies or economic outcomes. We did not find sufficient data comparing recombinant human thyrotropin with thyroid hormone withdrawal-aided radioiodine treatment for metastatic differentiated cancer.
Most of the trials of piracetam were undertaken many years ago and did not use methods which would be currently considered standard. Some of the studies suggested there may be some benefit from piracetam but overall the evidence is not consistent or positive enough to support its use for dementia or cognitive impairment.
This Cochrane Review is current to January 2019. We found nine trials with 1007 participants. Participants mean age was 56 to 68 years, and females comprised 29% to 56% of the participants. The participants had symptoms for several months or years and were diagnosed with a full-thickness tear with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound examination. Studies were conducted in Finland, Norway, Canada, USA, France, the Netherlands, Italy and South Korea. Our primary analysis included three trials with 339 participants who received either surgery (tendon repair and removal of bone from undersurface of acromion) or non-operative therapy (exercises with or without glucocorticoid injection). Three studies received funding however none of them reported using the funds directly for these trials. Compared with non-operative treatment, surgery resulted in little or no benefit in people with rotator cuff tears for up to one year.
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 9% (4% better to 13% better) or 0.9 points on a zero to 10 scale
• People who had non-operative treatment rated their pain as 1.6 points
• People who had surgery rated their pain as 0.7 points.

Function (0 to 100; higher scores mean better function)Improved by 6% (2% better to 10% better) or 6 points on a zero to 100 scale
• People who had non-operative treatment scored 72 points
• People who had surgery scored 78 points
Participant-rate global treatment success (participants satisfied with the outcome)
7% more people rated their treatment a success (4% fewer to 13% more), or seven more people out of 100.
• 48/55 (873/1000) of people considered treatment as successful with non-operative treatment
• 51/54 (943/1000) of people considered treatment as successful with surgery
Overall quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life)Worsened 1% (4% worse to 2% better) or 1.3 points on a zero to 100 scale
• People who had non-operative treatment rated their quality of life 58
• People who had surgery (subacromial decompression) rated their quality of life 57
Adverse events
• One adverse event (frozen shoulder) was reported in the trials in exercise group. Thus, we are unable to estimate comparative risk.
Serious adverse events
• No serious adverse events were reported in the trials. As compared with non-operative treatment, moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias) indicates that surgery (rotator cuff repair with or without subacromial decompression) probably provides little or no benefit in pain and low-certainty evidence indicates that it may provide little or no improvement in function, participant-rated global treatment success or overall quality of life (downgraded due to bias and imprecision) in people with rotator cuff tears. Due to only one reported adverse event across the trials, we cannot estimate if there is higher risk for adverse events after either treatment (very low-certainty evidence).
Fourteen studies involving 29,319 people with at risk of diabetes complications were included and 11 studies involving 29,141 people were included in our analyses. Tighter blood glucose control generally didn't show any benefits for patients compared to less tight glucose control. There was no difference in the risks for patients on kidney failure, death, or heart disease complications. A very small number of patients (1 in every 1000 treated each year) might avoid a heart attack with more intense blood glucose management. Some patients would expect to have less protein leakage through kidney function although the clinical impact of this benefit is unclear in the long term. The potential problems with treatment, such as side effects and risks of very low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) were not generally measured in the studies. The review concludes that people with diabetes receive uncertain benefits from tighter blood glucose control in the long-term and the immediate complications of this treatment approach are difficult to know accurately.
We found eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which investigated four different types of vitamin or mineral pills by comparing them to a placebo (a dummy pill). The vitamins tested were B vitamins (vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid), vitamin E, and vitamin E and C given together. The only mineral tested was chromium. Vitamin B combination versus placebo
Five trials with a total of 879 participants compared B vitamins with placebo. Four used combinations of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid; one small study tested folic acid on its own. None of these studies reported whether or not participants developed dementia. These studies did not find that memory or thinking skills differed between the group of people who took vitamin B supplements and those who took placebo after treatment lasting six months to two years. Our confidence in the results on different tests used in the studies varied from moderate to very low. Two years of vitamin B supplements did seem to help memory in a small subgroup of participants in one study who could be identified by a particular blood test at the start of the trial. One study found that there was probably no effect on participants' quality of life. One study scanned the brains of some participants and reported that B vitamins may slow the rate of brain shrinkage.
Harmful effects and deaths were reported in very few participants and we cannot conclude whether or not there are harms from taking these or similar combinations of B vitamins.
Vitamin E versus placebo.
One study with 516 participants compared a relatively high dose of vitamin E (2000 IU a day) to placebo in people who were also taking a multivitamin containing 15 IU of vitamin E (the daily requirement for vitamin E is approximately 30 IU). The risk of developing dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (the commonest form of dementia) is probably not affected by three years of treatment with high-dose vitamin E. The quality of the evidence for other outcomes was lower, but there may also be no effect of this dose of vitamin E on specific memory or thinking skills or on how well people could manage their daily activities.
Vitamin E and C versus placebo
One study with 256 participants compared a combination of vitamins C and E with placebo. It found no effect on overall memory and thinking skills, but we had little confidence in this result because of the quality of the evidence.
Chromium picolinate versus placebo
Only one very small study with 26 participants investigated the effect of chromium supplements. This study was too small for us to be able to draw any conclusions. The amount and quality of research evidence about vitamin and mineral supplements for treating MCI in people without nutritional deficiency is limited. At the moment, it is not possible to identify any supplements which can reduce the risk of people with MCI developing dementia or which can effectively treat their symptoms. More research is needed before we can answer our review question.
Unfortunately, we did not find any good quality trials to include in the review. This does not mean that carnitine is ineffective or should not be used in treating inborn errors of metabolism; however, individuals receiving carnitine should be carefully observed and monitored. Therefore, we recommend that clinicians base their decision to prescribe carnitine on clinical experience together with individual preferences. Future trials should include patient-reported outcomes using validated and internationally recognised scales. Any adverse events associated with the treatment should be reported. It should be carefully considered whether placebo-controlled trials in potentially lethal diseases, e.g. carnitine transporter disorder or glutaric aciduria type I, are ethical.
We identified three randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 50 participants with type 2 diabetes. Among the included studies, the duration of resveratrol supplementation ranged from four to five weeks. Resveratrol as a capsule or Softgel was taken at 10 mg, 150 mg, or 1000 mg daily and was compared to placebo.
This evidence is up-to-date as of December 2018. None of the included studies reported on important long-term, patient-relevant outcomes such as death from any cause, diabetes-related death, diabetes-related complications, health-related quality of life, or impact on treatment costs. However, no side effects and no deaths were observed in these short-term studies. No clear changes were observed for indicators of glucose management. We found eight ongoing studies with approximately 800 participants and two studies awaiting assessment, which, when published, could contribute to our findings. The overall certainty of evidence from the included studies was very low, mainly because the number of participants and the number of studies reporting the outcomes were small . Also, the duration of the studies was very short.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The search is up to date as of 12 July 2018. We found 11 trials with 818 infants. We considered no trial to be at low risk of bias.
Four trials included 329 infants in neonatal intensive care units and used a histamine 2 receptor antagonist for prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These four trials demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with a histamine 2 receptor antagonist, but no change in mortality. Outcomes such as serious gastrointestinal problems (e.g. necrotising enterocolitis) and infections were not reported.
Seven trials with 489 infants enrolled sick newborn infants with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and used either a histamine 2 receptor antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor for treatment. Use of a histamine 2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor in a treatment context was associated with a reduction of both duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and continued upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however it did not affect mortality or requirement for blood transfusion. No long-term follow-up was reported.
Although there is moderate-quality evidence that use of an inhibitor of gastric acid reduces the incidence and duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in newborn infants, there is insufficient safety data in this population. The implication of this is that caution should be applied when deciding whether to use an inhibitor of gastric acid in sick newborn infants until additional studies are performed. We graded the quality of evidence for prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding as low and moderate. We graded the quality of evidence for the treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding as low and very low.
The aim of this review is to find out which treatment, if any, is best. Only four of 32 reports identified met the inclusion criteria for this review; none showed a convincing benefit of any single drug over any others. Some treatments may be worth trying but staff should watch carefully for any side effects of the treatment (e.g. agitation or excessively dry mouth). Anxious relatives need explanation, reassurance and discussion about any fears and concerns associated with the terminal phase and 'death rattle'. Research in this difficult area is necessary to understand the cause of the noise, its effect on the patient and those around them and the best ways of managing this condition.
Ward reduction for newborn infants with gastroschisis is not supported or refuted by evidence from randomised controlled trials. Newborn babies with gastroschisis are born with their gut hanging out of a hole in their belly. If the gut is not put back they could get sick from fluid and heat loss or part of the gut could die or they could get a life-threatening infection. Traditionally the gut is pushed back inside the belly under anaesthetic in the operating theatre but in some hospitals they push the gut back without anaesthetic in the neonatal ward (i.e., ward reduction). It is not known which method gives better outcomes. The reviewers did not identify any randomised studies comparing the two approaches. They concluded that there is no evidence either supporting or refuting ward reduction of gastroschisis.
We found 28 studies that had involved a total of 1804 people with borderline personality disorder. These studies examined various psychological treatments. Some of these are called 'comprehensive' treatments because the person talks one-to-one with a professional for at least part of the time. Other treatments are called 'non-comprehensive' because they do not involve this one-to-one work.
A number of studies have been carried out on one particular type of comprehensive treatment, called Dialectical Behaviour Therapy. For this treatment, there were sufficient studies for us to pool the results and draw conclusions. The results indicate Dialectical Behaviour Therapy is helpful for people with borderline personality disorder. Effects included a decrease in inappropriate anger, a reduction in self-harm and an improvement in general functioning.
There were generally too few studies to allow firm conclusions to be drawn about the value of all the other kinds of psychotherapeutic interventions evaluated. However, single studies show encouraging findings for each treatment that was investigated, both 'comprehensive' and 'non-comprehensive' types. More research is needed.
We included 11 studies involving 762 people with COPD flare-ups. These studies were funded by local health authorities, researchers or universities where researchers work. Usually, neither the participants nor the people doing the research knew which treatment the participants were getting; although in one study, treatment was known to the people who were doing the research. Studies were done in one or two centres in many countries between 2004 and 2018. The average age of participants ranged from 62 to 76 years. Seven studies tested magnesium infusion, three studies assessed magnesium inhalation, and one study examined both. The evidence in this review is current to 2 August 2021. People who received magnesium infusion may have fewer admissions to hospital from the emergency room. Seven people with COPD flare-ups would need to be treated with magnesium infusion to prevent one additional person being admitted to hospital. There was little to no difference in terms of breathing support without intubation (putting a tube into the windpipe to help a person to breathe). None of the participants required breathing support with intubation. Included studies did not report ICU admission or deaths. Only one trial reported on serious adverse events, but no-one in the study experienced any. Magnesium infusion may shorten the duration of hospital stay and reduce breathlessness. However, we were not clear about its effect on lung function, oxygen concentration in blood or adverse events.
Magnesium inhalation (nebuliser) had little or no effect on hospital admission or the need for breathing support (with or without intubation) compared to placebo. Nebulised magnesium may reduce ICU admission and improve breathlessness. However, we are not confident of these findings due to small number of participants and study limitations. There is no evidence of a difference for duration of hospital stay, lung function or oxygen saturation in blood. Serious adverse events were not reported. There is no available data for adverse events. One trial reported one death in the placebo group, but we are not confident to draw any conclusion as the trial had very few participants.
Only one study compared magnesium sulfate inhalation and infusion versus inhaled ipratropium bromide and placebo infusion. We could not identify any differences between the effects of these treatments. Magnesium infusion may reduce hospital admissions, shorten length of hospital stay and improve breathlessness compared to placebo. We are very uncertain about its effect on the need for breathing support, lung function or blood oxygen concentration because the studies were small. We do not have enough information to assess any effects on serious adverse events or deaths. The effects of magnesium inhalation compared to placebo or magnesium sulfate versus ipratropium bromide are unclear.
Magnesium sulfate infusion may be useful as an add-on treatment for COPD flare-ups. However, we cannot draw conclusions about whether magnesium sulfate inhalation is helpful for use in people with COPD flare-ups.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation with adults who were diagnosed with depression and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, or a chronic respiratory condition. An RCT is a study with a control group, in which participants are allocated to the treatment and control groups at random. We searched a variety of online databases, including regional databases and trial registries. The search, conducted on 4 October 2019, identified 6066 records. After screening records, we included two studies in this review and 181 participants contributed data to the analyses.
Both studies recruited participants from US hospitals. One study included participants recovering from a stroke and the other included women with breast cancer. In both studies, participants received behavioural activation delivered in eight weekly, face-to-face sessions. One study compared behavioural activation with poststroke treatment as usual, while the other compared behavioural activation with problem-solving therapy, a talking therapy.
Low to moderate-certainty evidence suggested that behavioural activation may be more effective in the treatment of depression than included comparators, but these estimates were imprecise and effects were reduced in the longer term. There was no evidence of any differences between groups in the number of people who dropped out of the studies, depression symptoms, quality of life, physical functioning, or anxiety symptoms. The studies did not report on side effects during the study period.
There were several limitations to the included studies. In both studies, participants were aware of the treatment they received. Also, researchers were involved in the design of the intervention in both studies, and may, therefore, have had an interest in a favourable outcome for behavioural activation. In one study, missing data caused by participants dropping out of the study may have influenced results.
We did not find enough evidence in this review to know whether behavioural activation should be used to treat depression in adults with long-term physical conditions.
We searched for evidence up to 13 July 2018. We analysed data from two trials, one of which randomly allocated 65 people with drug-resistant tuberculosis to either a linezolid-containing or linezolid-free drug combination, and another that randomly allocated 39 participants to receive linezolid as part of their treatment from the start or have it added after a delay of two months. We also included 14 studies, including 1678 people, in which some participants received linezolid but others did not, but this was not determined at random. One trial showed a higher likelihood of cure and lower risk of treatment failure in participants receiving linezolid compared to those who did not. The second trial showed that participants who received linezolid immediately had a higher chance of tuberculosis being cleared from their sputum four months after the start of the study than those who added linezolid after a two-month delay.
When they examined safety, the first trial found a higher risk of developing low red blood cell counts, nausea and vomiting, and nerve damage in people receiving linezolid. From 11 of the non-randomized studies that reported this, 22.6% of people had to stop linezolid due to adverse effects (side effects), though further comparisons of harmful effects were not possible due to incomplete reporting in the non-randomized studies.
Overall, although there is some evidence of benefit, we have very low certainty in its accuracy. More high-quality studies are required before we can be certain how effective and safe linezolid is for drug-resistant tuberculosis. This review is current up to 13 July 2018.
The review includes two randomised clinical trials with 493 participants. The risk of bias was low. Both trials compared recombinant human activated factor VII with placebo. The meta-analysis showed that the recombinant human activated factor VII does not seem to reduce mortality in patients with liver disease and suffering from upper gastrointestinal bleeding, irrespective of the grade of liver damage. The current evidence is insufficient to support or reject recombinant human activated factor VII for these patients.
We wanted to find out if silicone hydrogel SCLs can decrease eye discomfort and complications such as eye infections compared with hydrogel SCLs. We searched for studies that compared silicone hydrogel SCLs versus hydrogel SCLs in adults 18 years of age or older. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study designs and methods. We found seven studies including a total of 1371 participants who ranged in age between 21 and 33 years, with more women than men participating in the majority of the studies. Three studies enrolled only new SCL wearers; two studies enrolled both new and experienced SCL users; and two studies did not describe the experience level of the participants. Study periods ranged from one week to one year, with most studies lasting three months. Most studies were funded by companies that make SCLs or had authors who were employed by those companies, or both.
When comparing hydrogel and silicone hydrogel SCLs in terms of comfort, the evidence is of very low certainty that one provides better comfort than the other. While the evidence is of very low certainty, hydrogel SCLs may be safer than silicone hydrogel SCLs after one year of wear. We have low confidence in the evidence for the safety and comfort of silicone hydrogel versus hydrogel contact lenses. Our confidence was mainly influenced by flawed study design and conduct. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they received, such that the self-reported comfort level might be biased. The evidence is current to June 2022.
For this updated review, 43 randomised clinical trials involving 4966 women with non-viable pregnancies at less than 24 weeks' gestation were included. The main interventions examined were vaginal, sublingual, oral and buccal misoprostol, mifepristone and vaginal gemeprost. These were compared with surgical management, expectant management, placebo, or different types of medical interventions were compared with each other. Fourteen comparisons had only one trial. The studies varied in risk of bias. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low or low for most comparisons.
Vaginal misoprostol may hasten miscarriage when compared with placebo but made little difference to rates of nausea, diarrhoea or to whether women were satisfied with the acceptability of the method. It is uncertain whether vaginal misoprostol when compared to placebo reduces blood loss or pain because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was found to be very low.
Vaginal misoprostol was less effective in accomplishing a complete miscarriage compared to surgical management and may be associated with more nausea and diarrhoea. Vaginal misoprostol made little difference to pelvic infection, blood loss, pain or women's satisfaction/acceptability of method when compared to surgical management.
There was little difference between different routes of giving misoprostol when trials compared the vaginal route with placing it under the tongue or between oral and vaginal misoprostol. Single studies found mifepristone to be more effective than placebo and vaginal misoprostol to be more effective than expectant management. However the quality of this evidence was found to be very low and so we are not convinced of these findings. Mifepristone did not appear to provide any additional benefit when added to misoprostol. Using misoprostol as an alternative to surgical treatment may decrease the need for surgery for women with an early fetal death. The use of misoprostol can have some side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea, but risks of severe blood loss or pelvic infection were not higher compared to surgical treatment or expectant management. Further research is needed on drug doses, routes of administration and potential adverse effects, including future fertility, and also on women's views of drug treatment, surgery and waiting for spontaneous miscarriage.
First, we searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinical studies where people are randomly put into one or more treatment groups. This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of treatment. We compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorized the evidence as very low, low, moderate or high certainty. We found six RCTs that included 1160 participants who had CVI. Three RCTs compared the CHIVA method with vein stripping, one RCT compared the CHIVA method with compression dressings in people with venous ulcers. The newly included studies included three comparisons, one compared CHIVA with vein stripping (where a vein is removed or tied off) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA; which destroys the nerve fibres carrying pain signals to the brain), and one compared CHIVA with vein stripping and endovenous laser therapy (where veins are heated by a laser). The results showed that the CHIVA method may make little or no difference to the recurrence of varicose veins and may reduce slightly nerve injury and bruising in the lower limb compared to stripping. The CHIVA method showed similar numbers of limb infection and superficial vein thrombosis (inflammation and clotting in a vein) as vein stripping. Compared to RFA, CHIVA may make little or no difference to rates of limb infection, superficial vein thrombosis, nerve injury or hematoma (a severe bruise within the soft tissues), but may cause more bruising. Compared to endovenous laser, CHIVA may make little or no difference to recurrence and numbers of side effects. Further studies are needed to confirm these conclusions since they are based on a small number of clinical trials with methodological limitations such as a high risk of bias. In addition, participants and outcome assessors were not blinded to what treatments groups were given, and the results were imprecise due to the low number of events. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 19 October 2020.
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, depending on the outcome (what symptom or effect was measured) and the comparison. Vortioxetine was more effective than placebo, but it was not more effective than other commonly used antidepressants. The studies found no difference in people stopping their treatment compared to placebo or other antidepressants. Vortioxetine was only compared to one type of medicine (called SNRIs) and not compared to the most frequently prescribed antidepressants. The outcomes varied markedly across studies. No firm conclusion on vortioxetine can be made. Vortioxetine was effective in treating acute major depression, but did not show a clear advantage in comparison with some treatments which are already available. Conclusions are also made difficult because comparisons to the most frequently prescribed antidepressants (called SSRIs) are lacking. Furthermore, it is unclear if vortioxetine has an advantage in specific side effects associated with commonly prescribed antidepressants, for example sexual problems. These questions should be addressed in future studies.
This review of trials showed that, although the four-dose artemether-lumefantrine regimen was superior to chloroquine, in general the four-dose regimen was less effective compared with the six-dose regimen or other drug combinations. The fact that the four-dose regimen is generally less effective means it is unlikely that it would be used for treating uncomplicated malaria.
We did not include any new trials in this update.
We included 3 randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) involving a total of 91 children with croup aged from 6 months to 4 years. All studies were conducted in emergency departments. Studies took place with a duration of between 7 and 16 months; 2 studies were conducted in the USA, and 1 in Spain. In one study children with mild croup received either heliox or 30% oxygen; in another study children with moderate croup received oral dexamethasone (a type of corticosteroid) and either heliox or no treatment; and in the third study children with moderate to severe croup received injected dexamethasone and either heliox or 100% oxygen with adrenaline. Given the very limited available evidence, uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness and safety of heliox. Heliox may be no more effective than 30% oxygen for children with mild croup; as effective as 100% oxygen given with one or two doses of adrenaline; and slightly more effective than no treatment for children with moderate croup. None of the studies reported adverse events (side effects). The certainty of the evidence was low, as the trials included few children, and in one trial children, their families, and the doctors knew which treatment had been given.
We identified three randomised studies up to August 2017, including 171 women over the age of 18 years, with moderate or severe CIN. The trials ran from June 2005 to April 2012, June 2002 to October 2003, and May to October 2004. One of them was discontinued before it was completed. The women were given either celecoxib or rofecoxib versus a placebo (sugar tablet) daily by mouth for a period of three to six months. With the addition of the third trial to this review, there is now a sufficient number of patients in the review to conclude that NSAIDs have minimal effect over placebo in causing regression of CIN. No patients progressed to invasive cervical cancer, and overall, the drug was well-tolerated compared to placebo. The studies appear to have been well-conducted. There are some questions related to the quality of evidence in relation to concealment and women dropping out of the study before completion of assigned medications. We therefore concluded that the certainty (quality) of the evidence was moderate. There was insufficient information to assess accuracy of the reporting of information. It is possible that there are other incomplete and unreported studies that have not been identified. The literature available at this time suggests that there are no convincing data to suggest NSAIDs as a treatment for CIN.
We searched scientific databases and found two randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) including 86 adults that met our inclusion criteria. Both trials compared implantable cardioverter defibrillators with medical therapy in people with Brugada syndrome who had already survived a sudden cardiac arrest event. We found no studies in people who had not experienced such an event or with other abnormalities. These two studies were small, were performed by the same investigators from Thailand, were funded by a device company, and had major methodological limitations, including being stopped early. Nearly all (98%) participants were men who had an average age of 44 years old. All-cause mortality (death from any cause) was lower in people who received the implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Rates of survived sudden cardiac arrest, heart attack, and stroke were higher, primarily due to differences in survived sudden cardiac arrest rates. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators had a higher rate of side effects compared with medical therapy, including receiving inappropriate shocks from their defibrillators, which required reprogramming of these devices. There was low quality evidence that implantable cardioverter defibrillators lower mortality in people with inherited heart rate abnormalities who have survived a sudden cardiac arrest event because of few, small, low quality studies. These devices carry a higher risk of side effects than medical therapy. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the results.
We included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs), that is, studies in which participants are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups. Five of the studies took place in the USA, and the sixth in Iran. The studies included 438 people with ADHD. All evaluated a long-acting version of bupropion, that is to say, a version of the drug is absorbed slowly, and can therefore be taken just once a day. This simple dosage suits people with ADHD, as the illness may make it difficult for them to remember to take their medication.
The duration of the studies varied between six and 10 weeks. All participants were diagnosed with ADHD, and often had other mental health problems. In one study, all participants had ADHD and were addicted to opioids (a drug that relieves pain). Four studies were funded by industry and two studies were publicly funded. In one of the publicly-funded studies, the lead author was paid by industry (although not by the manufacturers of buproprion) for research activities. Bupropion may lead to a small improvement in ADHD and it may also decrease symptoms related to ADHD. The drug does not have more adverse effects than treatment with placebo. Bupropion may be an alternative treatment for adults with ADHD who cannot or will not take stimulant drugs. The quality of the evidence in this review is low, because we found very few studies; five of the six studies were small, and all were poorly conducted. The effect of bupropion on various aspects of daily functioning was not investigated. Also, no studies assessed the long-term effects of this drug. Further studies are needed, to assess whether bupropion is effective in specific ADHD subgroups or in people who have additional disorders.
The evidence in this review is current up to 14 September 2016. 39 studies were included with a total of 3520 participants. Participants were male and female, all ages and ethnic origins, out patients or in patients, who were scheduled to have radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy to the head and neck.
Drugs included were any prescribed to prevent salivary gland problems and given before or during radiotherapy. Information was collected from the end of radiotherapy except for that about adverse effects. Different techniques for giving radiation treatment that might reduce damage were not included.
The main outcomes measured were participant's own assessment of dry mouth and the measurement of salivary flow. Secondary outcomes measured included adverse or unwanted effects such as sweating, crying, watery discharge from the nose, diarrhoea and nausea. There is some low-quality evidence to suggest that the drug amifostine prevents the feeling of dry mouth in people receiving radiotherapy to the head and neck (with or without chemotherapy) in the short- (end of radiotherapy) to medium-term (three months after radiotherapy). However it is less clear whether or not this effect is sustained to 12 months after radiotherapy. The benefits of amifostine should be weighed against its high costs and side effects. Adverse effects of vomiting, low blood pressure, feeling of sickness and allergic response were all more frequent in those receiving amifostine. There was insufficient evidence to show that any other treatment is beneficial. The quality of evidence for amifostine was found to be low because of risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision caused by the small number of studies in the comparison or sample size. A standardized scale for measuring participant's experience of dry mouth would in future allow comparison and pooling together of results.
On 8 May 2013, we performed searches to look for clinical trials on the use of topiramate to treat neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. We found four studies of reasonable quality that tested topiramate against placebo for a number of weeks. Almost all of the 1684 people in the studies had painful limbs because of damaged nerves caused by diabetes.
Topiramate did not help the pain and was no different from placebo except in causing more side-effects, which made many more people withdraw from the studies early. About 3 people in 10 withdrew because of side-effects with topiramate compared with 1 in 10 with placebo.
Topiramate has not been shown to work as a pain medicine in diabetic neuropathy.
Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review and examined the added benefit of surgery over prednisolone for treatment of nerve damage of less than six months duration. Both trials were at high risk of bias. Two years from the start there was very low quality evidence of no significant difference in nerve function improvement between people treated with surgery plus prednisolone or with prednisolone alone. Adverse effects of decompressive surgery were not adequately described. No additional trials were identified when searches were updated in 2010 and 2012. Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage in leprosy but the available evidence from RCTs is of very low quality and does not show a significant added benefit of surgery over steroid treatment alone. Well-designed RCTs are needed to establish the effectiveness of the combination of surgery and medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone.
We searched for studies up to 19 October 2015, and we included 26 studies with 526 people. These people had breathlessness from different types of lung disease. Some were given opioid drugs and some were given other drugs or a placebo, and studies compared the reporting of breathlessness to see if there was any difference. Some studies also looked at the amount of time people could exercise to see if there were any differences. Some people came from home, and some came from the hospital setting. There was some low quality evidence that showed a benefit of using oral or injectable opioid drugs for the treatment of the symptoms of breathlessness. There was no evidence for opioids by nebuliser. Some people experienced drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting. More research is needed using more people, and looking at effects on quality of life. We rated the quality of the evidence using one of the following grades: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low quality evidence means we are uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means we are very certain about the results. For this Cochrane review, we found that the evidence was of low to very low quality. We included randomised controlled trials which were blinded, which means that participants and those people that assessed the results did not know whether the participants had received the opioid drug or a placebo. However, the trials were of small size, and some studies did not give enough information to allow us to assess whether they were of good quality.
Despite extensive searching, we identified only seven studies for inclusion. Our assessment of the quality and strength of evidence from these studies is low. This review shows that only a handful of medication safety strategies are studied in robust study designs. When the vulnerability of paediatric patients in hospital is considered, more research of high quality should be included on every research agenda.
We found five studies including 1146 adolescents with asthma. Studies varied by design, duration (2.5 to 9 months), setting (school, day camp, primary care) and the way that peer support or lay-led sessions were given. Asthma severity varied, as did the number who smoked. Three studies used a programme called Triple A (Adolescent Asthma Action), by which older adolescents are trained to deliver sessions to younger students; one of these studies tested the addition of a pledge to stop smoking; another delivered peer support group sessions including messages played through an mp3 player to encourage adherence; and the third compared an asthma day camp led by peers against one led by nurses and doctors. Adolescents who received peer support had better quality of life than those in the control group, although this varied with how results were analysed, so we were uncertain. Most other outcomes did not show an important benefit of the intervention. These studies provided very little information about asthma attacks or unscheduled visits during the trial, and we couldn't be sure whether the intervention was beneficial in terms of asthma control. Results from two studies in which a lot of the adolescents smoked showed some promise that adolescents had the confidence to stop, but overall nicotine dependence and smoking-related knowledge were not much better than in controls. Studies provided no reports of adverse events. We can't be sure of the results because most outcomes were rated by people who knew the group to which adolescents were assigned, and this can affect how people behave and respond to questions. Some studies didn't report everything they said they would, or reported information that we could not analyse. Sometimes study results didn't agree with results of other studies, and often we could not say for certain whether adolescents received benefit. For these reasons, we have low confidence in all study findings.
We included three randomised controlled studies. Two trials were at a high risk of bias and one was at a low risk of bias. One study did not contribute any data towards this review. Therefore, this review is based on data from two studies involving 740 mothers. The evidence from these studies was graded as either low or very low quality evidence.
We found insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of tests that measure placental health in reducing the number of babies that die before birth (very low quality evidence ) or shortly after birth (very low quality evidence ), or in reducing the number of babies that are born small for their gestational age (low quality evidence ).There was no evidence to suggest that measurement of placental health could cause harm by increasing intervention (planned delivery or caesarean section (low quality evidence ) or increasing mothers' anxiety levels. There was no change in the number of babies admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit or the proportion of babies born before 37 weeks gestation (low quality evidence). There were no reports of serious disease for babies (as reported in one study only) or maternal deaths in any of the studies. A number of this review's other outcomes of interest were not reported in the included studies.
More research is needed to determine the most useful test for placental health as a way of predicting poor pregnancy outcome, and then to investigate whether performing this test on mothers improves pregnancy outcomes.
We included four trials, with a total of 466 participants, which focused on the comparison of short-duration and long-duration of AED treatment in people with a single brain cyst. The trials considered six to 12 months as short-duration treatment, and 12 to 24 months as long-duration treatment. There were inconclusive results for the benefit of one duration of AED over the other (six, 12, or 24 months) for people with a single cyst. In people with calcified cysts, longer duration of therapy may be preferable.
All four included trials enrolled people with a single brain lesion. The findings of our review cannot be generalised to people with multiple cysts, or with cysts in unusual parts of the brain.
The evidence is current to January 2021.
Using more chemotherapy drugs in combination seems to help women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer to live for longer and to delay the cancer from spreading or getting worse. However, giving these extra drugs may cause more serious short-term side effects. We do not know what effect using more drugs has on long-term side effects, control of symptoms or quality of life because they were poorly studied in the individual trials included in this review.
We analyzed data from published studies called randomized controlled trials to understand if narrow band imaging reduces the risk of bladder cancer getting worse, and to see if there are any side effects. We only included randomized controlled trials because this study type is the most reliable. We identified eight randomized controlled trials that addressed our review question. Participants included in these studies were suspected to have bladder cancer or were diagnosed with bladder cancer that was limited to the inner wall, meaning that the cancer did not invade the underlying muscle layers. Based on limited available data, the use of narrow band imaging may lower the risk of disease recurrence over time.
None of the randomized controlled trials examined whether the choice of visualization method made any difference to the risk of bladder cancer becoming worse or the risk of the person dying from bladder cancer, so we do not know if the use of narrow band imaging is effective in improving these two outcomes.
We found that the use of narrow band imaging may have little or no increased risk of complications, compared to the standard visualization method. Due to certain flaws in the design of these clinical trials and some contradictory findings between trials, our confidence in these findings was low. With more research in the future, more reliable data may likely change these findings. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.
We searched several medical databases and identified four randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. Two of the four studies terminated early due to low recruitment (14 participants included) and did not release any results. We were therefore unable to include them in our statistical analysis. The two published analysed trials included 600 participants with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In both studies, the experimental group received G-CSF plus plerixafor subcutaneously, and the control group received G-CSF plus placebo. Both trials were sponsored by Genzyme, the manufacturer of plerixafor. We were able to conduct a meta-analysis of the data of the two studies for the outcomes mortality at 12 months, successful stem cell collection, and adverse events.
We found no evidence for a difference between the plerixafor and placebo group for the outcomes mortality at 12 months and adverse events during stem cell mobilisation period.
The meta-analysis showed an advantage for those participants randomised to plerixafor for the outcome successful stem cell collection. Furthermore, in both studies the time to collect a defined number of stem cells was significantly shorter in the plerixafor group compared to the placebo group.
In the study that enrolled people with multiple myeloma, 95.9% of the participants in the plerixafor arm and 88.3% in the placebo arm underwent transplantation. In the study that examined people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 90% of the participants in the plerixafor group and only 55.4% in the placebo group could be transplanted. It seems that especially people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma benefit from the addition of plerixafor in terms of successful transplantation, but there was no evidence for a difference for time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in transplanted participants.
None of the trials reported on quality of life or progression-free survival. The quality of the evidence was high for adverse events and successful stem cell collection and moderate for mortality at 12 months. The main limitation was a wide confidence interval.
There are a range of treatment options for urticaria, of which the most well-known are the H1-antihistamines. This review evaluated the efficacy and safety of a similar category, the H2-antihistamines, and included 4 low-quality studies, which examined 144 participants. No firm conclusions could be drawn, but the combination of ranitidine with diphenhydramine appeared to be slightly more effective in reducing the symptoms of urticaria than diphenhydramine alone. In one study, cimetidine appeared to be as effective as diphenhydramine. However, the combination of both drugs was more effective than diphenhydramine alone. Drowsiness and sedation were reported with diphenhydramine, but there was no significant difference in the level of sedation with either famotidine or diphenhydramine. The studies were rather old and considered very few outcomes that were of importance to people with urticaria. Therefore, there is currently insufficient evidence to indicate whether this type of medication is effective or not.
The review of 17 trials (some funded by drug companies) found that the trials were not of high quality; however the evidence suggested that there are no clinically important differences between giving fluids orally or intravenously. For every 25 children treated with fluids given orally, one child would fail and require intravenous rehydration. Further, the results for low osmolarity solutions, the currently recommended treatment by the World Health Organization, showed a lower failure rate for oral rehydration that was not significantly different from that of intravenous rehydration. Oral rehydration should be the first line of treatment in children with mild to moderate dehydration with intravenous therapy being used if the oral route fails. The evidence showed that there may be a higher risk of paralytic ileus with oral rehydration while intravenous therapy carries the risk of phlebitis (ie inflammation of the veins).
We looked at the evidence up to February 2014 and included 11 studies involving 699 participants. Ten studies provided data for analysis.The studies involved adults (over 18 years of age) who were undergoing routine or emergency surgery. We did not include studies in which patients were kept cold deliberately during the operation, were having head surgery or skin grafts or were under a local anaesthetic. We looked at studies comparing different rewarming methods versus each other or versus normal care (hospital blankets). We can be quite certain that temperature goes back to normal (between 36°C and 37.5°C) more than an hour faster when active warming methods are used to warm hypothermic patients than when hospital blankets are used, and that this result is important for people involved in the care of patients with hypothermia after surgery. Not enough evidence was found to show whether active warming methods provide other benefits or harms to patients. Some evidence suggests that forced air warming (one type of active warming) is better at rewarming patients than circulating hot water devices and radiant heaters (other types of active warming), but we do not know whether forced air warming is the best active warming method overall, as evidence on all methods of active warming was not available. Quality of the evidenceMost of the evidence was moderate to low in quality. Methods used to assign patients to treatment groups were generally unclear or inadequate, and it was not possible to keep patients or people assessing patients unaware of the treatment given. This may have biased the results, but we are not sure what influence this could have had on the overall results.
Both psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy have been used to treat PTSD and guidelines suggest that a combination of both may mean people recover from PTSD more effectively. Four trials including 124 participants were included in this review. One of these trials (n =24) was on children and adolescents. The trials all used SSRIs and prolonged exposure or a cognitive behavioural intervention. Only two trials reported on total PTSD symptoms but the data could not be combined.
In this review, there are too few studies to be able to draw conclusions about whether a combination of psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy result in better outcomes for patients than either of these treatments alone.
Results: We found five studies with 452 participants which met our inclusion criteria. Each compared the effects of clozapine at very low dose (up to 149 mg/day), low dose (150 mg/day to 300 mg/day) and standard dose (301 mg/day to 600 mg/day). None of the studies examined the effects of clozapine at higher than the standard dose. There was nothing to choose between standard, low and very low doses in terms of body mass index (BMI) measurements in the short term. However, weight gain was greater in those receiving the standard dose compared to those receiving the low dose. The incidence of unpleasant side effects (which included feeling lethargic, producing too much saliva, and feeling dizzy) was less at low dose compared to standard dose.
Quality of evidence: For main outcomes the quality was low or very low.
Conclusions: We found no evidence that might indicate the best dose of clozapine for patients with schizophrenia. Careful consideration has to be given to balancing the advantages and disadvantages of different doses in relation to weight gain and other side effects. Overall measurements of BMI were similar between groups; however, some side effects appear to be lower at lower doses. Overall, this review highlights the lack of evidence-based information available for addressing the question of what dose of clozapine is most effective with the least side effects. There is a need for large, well-designed and well-reported randomised clinical trials to address this question. There is a particular need for such trials to look at longer-term outcomes, and to examine the effects of clozapine when given at greater than the standard dose.
The purpose of the review was to see whether biofeedback, taught in prenatal classes, would have an effect in relieving pain during labour. The review includes four studies (involving 186 women who were pregnant for the first time). The randomised controlled studies were very different, and of poor quality, making it difficult to draw any firm conclusions. Most studies assessed the effects of electromyographic biofeedback, which measures muscle tone. There was no significant evidence of a difference between biofeedback and control groups in terms of assisted vaginal birth, caesarean section, augmentation of labour and the use of pharmacological pain relief. There was not enough information on electromyographic to assess its effect on pain during labour. This review is one in a series of Cochrane reviews examining pain relief in labour, which will contribute to an overview of systematic reviews of pain relief for women in labour (in preparation).
We wanted to know whether exercise improves pain and disability for people with chronic low back pain more than no treatment, usual care, placebo or other common treatments. In our review, chronic low back pain is pain that lasts three months or longer or that goes away but returns more than twice in one year. It does not have a specific cause such as a tumour or injury. Examples of common treatments are spinal manipulation, or psychological therapy. ‘Usual care’ is care provided by a family physician. We searched for studies that assessed the effects of exercise therapy on pain or disability compared to no treatment, usual care, placebo or other common treatments. People in the studies had to be adults with chronic low back pain.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 249 studies with a total of 24,486 people. Most studies took place in Europe (122 studies); other common study locations were Asia, North America, and the Middle East. Study participants’ average age was 43.7 years; 59% were women. Participants’ average pain intensity at the start of the studies was 51 points on a 100-point scale, where 100 is the most pain. They had back pain for 12 weeks to 3 years (78 studies) or longer than 3 years (72 studies); 99 studies did not report how long their participants had low back pain.
Sixty-one per cent of studies (151 studies) examined the effectiveness of two or more different types of exercise, and 57% (142 studies) compared exercise therapy to a non-exercise treatment. The most common types of exercises were core strengthening (127 study groups), mixed exercises (>2 types) (109 study groups), Pilates (29 study groups), general strengthening exercises (52 study groups), and aerobic exercise (30 study groups). Exercise sessions were one-on-one with a healthcare provider (163 study groups) or in a group exercise class (162 study groups). More than half of studies included another treatment alongside exercise (247 study groups), including education or advice (137 study groups), electrotherapy (46 study groups), or manual therapy (21 study groups).
Most studies measured pain (223 studies) and disability (223 studies). Only 12 studies reported data that we could use on unwanted effects of treatments. Studies followed people in the short term (6 to 12 weeks; 184 studies); medium term (13 to 47 weeks; 121 studies) and long-term (48 weeks or more, 69 studies).
We also identified 172 more recent studies that we will add to the next version of our review. People receiving exercise therapy rated their pain on average 15 points better and their disability 7 points better, on a scale of 0 to 100, three months after the start of treatment compared to people who had no treatment, usual care or placebo. Exercise is probably more effective for pain (35 studies, 2746 people) and probably slightly more effective for disability (38 studies, 2942 people) than no treatment, usual care or placebo at all follow-up periods.
Exercise may be more effective for pain (64 studies, 6295 people) and is probably more effective for disability (52 studies, 6004 people) than common treatments in the short and medium term.
Few studies reported mostly minor unwanted effects of exercise, most commonly increased low back pain and muscle soreness. However, the non-exercise groups reported similar types and numbers of unwanted effects. Our confidence in the evidence is limited. The studies used exercise therapy in different ways and so reported different results from each other. Some studies were very small – the average number of participants was just 98. It is possible that the design of some studies may have made the benefits of exercise seem larger than they are. The evidence is up to date to 28 April 2018.
This review included 53 randomised controlled trials comparing these interventions to various control groups (mostly usual standard sex education offered by schools). The search for trials was not limited by country, though most of the included trials were conducted in high-income countries, with just four trials in middle- and low-income countries, mainly representing the lower socio-economic groups. Interventions were administered in schools, community centres, healthcare facilities and homes. Meta-analysis was performed for studies where it was possible to extract data.
Only interventions involving a combination of education and contraception promotion (multiple interventions) was seen to significantly reduce unintended pregnancy over the medium-term and long-term follow-up period. Results for behavioural (secondary) outcomes were inconsistent across trials.
Limitations of this review include reliance on programme participants to report their behaviours accurately and methodological weaknesses in the trials.
We found only one completed trial, which included 75 people who received methylprednisolone or a placebo. However the results have not been fully published and were not available for further scrutiny. The published abstract did not report adverse events. There is presently no evidence from any trial to show whether immunotherapies may benefit people with this condition.
We await results from trials to show whether corticosteroids, immunoglobulin or other treatments that act on the immune system have an effect in the treatment of diabetic amyotrophy.
Searches are up to date to September 2016.
We wanted to find out whether giving an immunostimulant medication, on top of standard treatment, reduced the frequency of flare-ups in adults with COPD or chronic bronchitis. We also wanted to know whether immunostimulants reduced the risk of death, improved quality of life, and reduced the duration and severity of flare-ups. We searched for studies involving adults with COPD or chronic bronchitis or both, that took place over at least 12 weeks. Studies must have randomly divided participants into receiving either an immunostimulant or placebo (inactive replacement for a medicine), and directly compared the two groups. We included immunostimulants of any type and route of administration, although we did have prespecified criteria as to what constituted an 'immunostimulant' due to this term being relatively broad. We found 36 studies involving 6192 participants. These looked at a variety of immunostimulants over durations that ranged from three to 14 months.
Results showed that participants receiving immunostimulants were slightly more likely to be free of exacerbations over an average duration of six months, compared to those who had received placebo. Treating 11 people with immunostimulants for six months would prevent one person from experiencing a flare-up. We also found that immunostimulants likely reduced the number of participants requiring antibiotics for a flare-up. Immunostimulants appeared to be safe, well-tolerated, and not associated with an increased risk of side effects.
The impact of immunostimulants on death, quality of life, duration of flare-ups, and the duration of hospital stays due to a flare-up was unclear. Immunostimulants were generally favoured over placebo in most studies that looked at these outcomes. Overall, we are moderately confident in these results. Our confidence was reduced by how different some results looked between studies, the small number of studies included in some analyses, and in some instances by not having enough data or participant numbers to determine whether immunostimulants were truly better or the same as placebo. The evidence is up-to-date to January 2022.
In other Cochrane reviews, alarms triggered by wetting, desmopressin and tricyclic drugs have been shown to work during treatment. However, alarms have a more sustained effect than desmopressin and tricyclics after treatment has finished. The adverse effects of alarm therapy (tiredness and waking other members of the family) are relatively benign and self limiting compared with the adverse effects of drugs. One class of drugs (anticholinergic drugs) appears to improve the efficacy of other established treatments such as tricyclics, bedwetting alarms and desmopressin. The cost of treating children with bedwetting with alarm therapy or drugs may vary in different countries.
We assessed twelve studies involving 2196 participants who were taking self-administered medications for at least one month. The studies involved different types of packaging, and different medications for various health problems. We found that reminder packaging increased the proportion of people taking their medications when measured by pill count; however, this effect was not large. We also found some evidence that reminder packaging may be beneficial in improving clinical outcomes such as blood pressure. Reminder packing for certain individuals may represent a simple method for improving the adherence to medications; further research is needed to improve the design and targeting of these devices.
The review of trials found no evidence that unopposed oestrogen and combined oestrogen and progestogen have an effect on body weight additional to that usually gained at the time of menopause. The review did not find any evidence that HRT prevents weight gain experienced at menopause.
We included 41 randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 10,681 people in our review. There were five different interventions which we call 'supportive interventions': changes to the organisation of nutritional care (13 studies, 3456 people), changes to the feeding environment (5 studies, 351 people), modification of the meal profile or pattern (12 studies, 649 people), additional supplementation of meals (10 studies, 6022 people) and home meal delivery systems (1 study, 203 people). Monitoring participants over time (follow-up) ranged from ‘duration of hospital stay’ to 12 months. The comparator groups received 'usual' care. More than half of all participants took part in studies investigating the additional supplementation of meals (for example a protein-energy oral nutritional supplement in addition to the usual diet). It is possible that supportive interventions for enhancing dietary intake in nutritionally vulnerable groups reduce death from any cause (approximately 23 fewer cases of death per 1000 participants in favour of supportive interventions). However, this has to be confirmed by more evidence from high-quality randomised controlled studies. The number of participants experiencing any medical complication did not differ substantially between the supportive interventions and the comparator groups. The same was found for health-related quality of life (which is physical, mental, emotional and social health attributed to health), patient satisfaction, nutritional or energy intake and days spent in hospital. Economic costs were not well investigated.
Only three studies reported on side effects, describing intolerance to the nutritional supplement (such as diarrhoea or vomiting in 5 of 34 participants) and discontinuation of oral nutritional supplements because of refusal or dislike of taste (567 of 2017 participants).
After analysing 15 studies in 1945 participants we found a beneficial effect of supportive interventions compared with comparators on weight: on average people in the supportive interventions groups increased their weight 0.6 kg more than people in the comparator groups.
This evidence is up to date as of September 2016. The overall quality of evidence ranged between moderate to very low, mainly because for most of our outcomes there was only a small number of studies and participants to achieve reliable information, or because risk of bias made results uncertain. However, if some randomised controlled studies with low risk of bias for our patient-important outcomes and a good number of participants were performed, this review could quickly provide good guidance for better health care.
We looked at evidence from randomised, parallel-group, controlled studies. Following a comprehensive literature search and assessment of trials, we included 41 studies (number of participants = 9005). Most people experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and had newly diagnosed OSA. Duration of studies ranged from 28 days to two years. We grouped the trials into those that gave people a) education, b) a supportive intervention, c) behavioural intervention, and d) a mixed intervention (using all thee techniques).
We found that all types of interventions increase CPAP usage with varying levels of certainty. Behavioural therapy increases machine usage by 79 minutes per night, and ongoing supportive interventions probably increase machine use by about 42 minutes per night. Educational and mixed interventions may potentially improve machine usage, however the certainty of this evidence is very low.
We also wanted to look at other outcomes such as daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), quality of life, depression, and apnoea hypopnoea index (measurement of pauses in breathing and slow or shallow breathing). Not all included studies consistently examined these other outcomes, however behavioural interventions may reduce daytime sleepiness.
Studies generally recruited people who were new to CPAP. The quality of evidence for improved CPAP adherence varied considerably across studies and study types. We were confident that the behavioural interventions improve adherence for around 70 minutes per night. The quality of evidence for educational, supportive, and mixed interventions was not as strong. The quality of evidence for OSA-related symptoms including daytime sleepiness, quality of life, anxiety or depression was affected by the low number of studies that measured these outcomes.
The review authors searched the medical literature for studies up to March 2014. We searched for trials which compared middle ear infections in people randomly selected to receive zinc supplements or who did not receive supplements. We found 10 eligible studies, all conducted amongst young children. The total number of participants was 6820. Nine trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Seven trials were conducted on healthy children. Participants included both males and females. The results of the trials provided no convincing evidence that zinc supplements reduce the occurrence of middle ear infections in healthy children. However, in one small study of severely malnourished children, those receiving zinc supplements had fewer middle ear infections. The only adverse effect was vomiting. The trial evidence included is generally of good quality, with a low risk of bias. All the included trials included otitis media only as a secondary outcome. Therefore, there was a potential to miss trials which were less publicised or less well indexed within the electronic databases.
We found three studies enrolling 760 participants that compared various treatments for catheter-related bloodstream infections. No studies compared similar treatment strategies or had similar outcomes, and therefore we were unable to combine data in our meta-analyses. The comparisons included systemic antibiotics with two different lock solutions, systemic antibiotics alone versus systemic antibiotics plus an ethanol lock solution, and systemic antibiotics plus catheter removal versus systemic antibiotics plus catheter exchange.
One study reported a higher success rate for clearing infection with systemic antibiotics plus ethanol locking treatment than systemic antibiotics alone. The other studies reported no difference between their two treatment arms. Outcomes such as venous stenosis and/or thrombosis, antibiotic resistance, death, and adverse events were not reported. Further randomised studies to identify the benefits and harms of catheter-related bloodstream infection treatments are needed.
Six trials providing information on the review question were identified. A total of 488 people with acute cholecystitis were included. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed early (within seven days of people presenting to the doctor with symptoms) in 244 people while it was performed after at least six weeks in the remaining 244 people. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. All the trials were at high risk of bias (and might have overestimated the benefits or underestimated the harms of either early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy). All the people included in the trials were discharged home alive after operation in the five trials from which this information was available. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury, surgical complications, or who required conversion from key-hole to open operation between the two groups. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days. There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups. Only one trial reported the time taken for employed people to return to work. The people belonging to the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group returned to work 11 days, on average, earlier than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Four trials did not report any gallstone-related complications during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone-related complications, including two people with cholangitis. There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone-related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trial. Approximately one-sixth of people belonging to the delayed group had either non-resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. Based on information from a varied number of participants as well as trials at high risk of bias, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis appears safe and shortens the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely and hence one cannot rule out that future trials may show that one treatment or another may be better in terms of complications. However, the trial size required to show such differences involves a clinical trial on more than 50,000 people and so it is unlikely that such large trials will be performed. Several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta-analyses.
We searched for evidence on 28 June 2016 and found 15 randomised studies, involving 6008 women. Thirteen of these studies provided data we could use. The quality of results ranged from very low to high (GRADE). Most studies had design limitations, which in some were serious. Most studies compared women taught how to check for signs of premature labour with women who were also given a home uterine activity monitor. In some studies both groups used a monitor but one group had a ‘sham’ monitor that did not actually send the data to the women’s healthcare providers.Using a monitor at home made very little difference to many of the outcomes for mother or baby, although not all studies measured all outcomes. Women using monitors were no less likely to experience preterm birth at less than 37 or 32 weeks of pregnancy (GRADE very low). Women using monitors were less likely to experience preterm birth at less than 34 weeks, but when we analysed only high-quality studies, no clear difference remained (GRADE high). Babies born to women using the monitor were less likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (GRADE moderate) but there were no fewer deaths (GRADE low). Women using the monitor were more likely to make an unscheduled antenatal visit (GRADE moderate), but the number of antenatal hospital admissions did not differ (GRADE low). Women using monitors appeared to be more likely to receive tocolysis (treatment to stop labour) (GRADE low), but when we looked only at high-quality studies there was no clear difference. We found no data to assess women's views, although one large trial reported low compliance with monitor use. In some studies, women with monitors had more contact with midwives or maternity nurses, but it is unclear what effect this had. Home uterine monitoring may result in fewer admissions to a neonatal intensive care unit, but more unscheduled antenatal visits and treatment for preterm labour. The level of evidence is generally low to moderate.
We found six randomised controlled studies involving 546 women who were pregnant with one baby and were showing signs of preterm labor at between 23 to 34 weeks' gestation. We graded the following evidence as mainly low quality because of the low number of women in the studies and a wide variation in findings. We found that the number of births before 37 weeks may be slightly reduced when women and their doctors know the results of the FFN test (20.7% versus 29.2%; 5 trials; 434 women). However, knowledge of FFN results may make little or no difference for the other outcomes with available data, including: maternal hospitalization (5 trials; 441 women); use of uterine relaxants (tocolysis) to try to prevent labor; earlier preterm births; women’s gestational age at delivery; babies with a birthweight less than 2500 g; newborn deaths; the number of babies with respiratory distress syndrome; giving steroids to mature the unborn babies’ lungs; and number of days in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This review of six studies did not find enough evidence to say whether or not the FFN test should be used in the management of women showing signs of preterm labor. A screening test such as FFN can only be considered effective if interventions based on the screening results, such as giving drugs to relax the uterus, reduce the number of preterm births. Further research should be encouraged.
The review included one study with 96 males with Hunter syndrome aged between 4.9 and 30.9 years of age. The trial compared idursulfase 0.5 mg/kg given either weekly or every-other week, or weekly infusions of placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The study lasted 53 weeks. Current evidence is limited given there was only one randomised clinical trial found in the medical literature. As compared with placebo, enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase in people with Hunter syndrome, led to some improvement in the individuals' ability to walk and a reduction in the excretion of abnormal mucopolysaccharides in the urine. To date there is no evidence available in the literature showing that treatment reduces complications of the disease related to quality of life and mortality. This trial was considered to be of overall good quality.
Only randomised controlled trials (RCT) were eligible for this review. In RCTs the patients are assigned to each of the groups in a random fashion so as to reduce the potential for bias. Either one group of patients had swallowing therapy, the other had a sham treatment or no treatment, or two forms of swallowing therapy were compared to each other.
There were no controlled trials, randomised or otherwise, in this field. Therefore there is no trial evidence to prove or disprove the benefit of swallowing therapy for the treatment of swallowing disorders in people with Parkinson's disease. It should be emphasised that this lack of evidence does not mean lack of effect.
There is one large RCT currently recruiting patients that will compare 'chin down' posture with thickened liquids in the treatment of dysphagia. The main outcomes in this study will be the rates of aspiration and pneumonia.
Large well designed placebo-controlled RCTs are needed to assess the effectiveness of swallowing therapy for swallowing disorders in Parkinson's disease. The design of the trials should minimise bias and be reported fully using CONSORT guidelines. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients should be chosen and the patients followed for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any improvement.
We looked at studies that were finished by 7 March 2021. We found two studies that looked at an immune modulating agent called rituximab, which targets immune cells, called B-cells.
The studies compared two groups of adults with primary AIHA who were treated:
· with rituximab and steroid
· with steroid alone
It’s important to know that these studies were very small, including a total of 96 people. And the design of one study had a problem that may have affected the results.  At 12 months after beginning treatment, rituximab and steroid appear to help more people recover from primary AIHA than steroid alone.Researchers think the quality of this research finding is low. They think future research is likely to change these results.
· At six months after beginning treatment, there was no difference in recovery between the adults treated with rituximab and a steroid and those treated with a steroid alone. · Side effects between the two groups were the same.  mayhelp more people have a complete recovery from newly diagnosed, primary warm AIHA than steroid alone. Side effects appear to be about the same for both treatments. Butmore research is neededto know for sure.
Doctors offer other treatments for primary AIHA that may be helpful, but there is a lack of research about how well they work. For now, based on the little information we have, the patient and doctor will have to carefully make decisions together about treating primary AIHA.
This review looked at four studies that enrolled 229 people (256 eyes) and compared the use of accommodative IOLs to the use of monofocal IOLs in cataract surgery. We last searched for evidence in October 2013. The results of the review showed that participants who received accommodative IOLs had improvements in near vision at six months and at 12 months after surgery compared to those who received monofocal IOLs. However, such improvements were small and reduced with time. Low-quality evidence also showed that more than 12 months after surgery, there was a compromise in distance vision for people with accommodative IOLs. This may be related to the finding that those who received accommodative IOLs also appeared to have a higher rate of posterior capsular opacification (thickening and clouding of the tissue behind the IOL). However, these findings were uncertain. Further research on accommodative IOLs is required before we can draw conclusions on their effectiveness and safety compared to monofocal IOLs Overall the quality of the evidence was low or very low with the exception for the findings on near vision at six months.
In evidence current to September 2016, we found one trial that primarily tested if brain oxygenation can be stabilised by combining NIRS measurements of the brain with a treatment guideline on how to intervene when the brain oxygenation is outside the normal range. The 166 infants included were born more than 12 weeks before term. They were monitored during the first three days of life. The study was funded by government agency, and we found that the methods used in trial were as good as possible. The single trial we found showed a large and significant difference in brain oxygenation between the experimental group and the control group. Low oxygenation was far more common in the control group. It did not, however, find that monitoring with NIRS reduces mortality or the occurrence of the most common complications of very preterm birth, i.e. intracranial bleedings, chronic lung disease, damage of the intestines (necrotising enterocolitis), and blindness (retinopathy of prematurity).
The NIRS monitoring did not cause serious harm, but skin marks from the NIRS sensor were seen in about 1 in 10 patients. The accrued information size with one small randomised trial is too small to conclude anything about the benefits and harms of cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy in preterm infants. Thus further studies are needed.
We included six randomised, double-blind trials from five publications involving a total of 387 participants published between 1987 and 1995 in the English language. All included trials used the RhinoTherm device, which delivered heated, humidified air for different lengths of time and at different flow rates to treat common cold symptoms. Three trials were conducted in the USA, two in the UK, and one in Israel. Most studies recruited people with naturally occurring colds, but one study induced colds by infecting participants. The RhinoTherm devices were provided by Netzer Sereni in four studies and A Beacham in two studies. One study was funded by Cleveland Clinic internal funding, and another was supported by authors' discretionary funds. The remaining studies did not mention funding sources. None of the included studies reported any worsening in clinical symptom scores after inhaling heated, humidified air. Participants in two trials showed a lack of persistent symptoms, however the results were inconsistent. Two studies reported minor adverse events. There was no effect of treatment on rhinovirus shedding. Using GRADE criteria, we assessed the quality of the evidence as low for the outcomes reduction in the clinical severity of the common cold (measured by decrease in the symptom score index); number of participants with the subjective response: therapy did not help; and number of participants with a positive viral culture in the nasal washings, due to risk of bias and inconsistency of the study results.
We identified 15 randomised trials meeting the review inclusion criteria. These include 14 trials reporting data from 2894 women; one trial reported data from 969 cycles so could not be included in meta-analysis. All of the included studies were parallel-design randomised controlled trials conducted in Brazil, Chile, Singapore, Argentina, Finland, Turkey, Spain, Israel, Canada, Greece, Japan, Italy, Norway and Belgium. The evidence is current to April 2016. Only three of 15 studies reported on live birth as an outcome. We found that there was no clear evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for rates of live birth, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy or miscarriage. There were no data reported for complication rate, fetal abnormality or women's evaluation of the procedure. Allocation concealment was poorly reported in the included studies and blinding was not possible (although we feel this is unlikely to affect pregnancy outcomes). Blinding of outcome assessors was not reported. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main reasons for downgrading the evidence were poor reporting of study methods (risk of bias), lack of agreement between studies (inconsistency), low event rates and lack of accuracy (imprecision) for some outcomes and poor reporting of live birth outcomes (selective reporting).
Any further studies comparing these timings of embryo transfer are unlikely to alter the findings and we do not plan to update this review again. Many of the trials included in this review have used outdated techniques that include stimulation, laboratory technology and transferring more than one embryo. We would direct the reader to the Glujovsky 2016 Cochrane review comparing Day 2/3 with day 5/6 embryo transfer.
We searched for relevant research studies up to 20 August 2016. We found 14 studies that analysed the effectiveness of behavioural interventions to promote RPE use. We also located one ongoing study. Studies had been conducted with 2052 farm, healthcare, production line, office and coke oven workers as well as nursing students and people with mixed occupations. We did not find any studies where the researchers conducted and assessed an intervention at the level of a whole organization. All included studies compared different education and training interventions to encourage workers to use RPE correctly or more often. We found very low quality evidence that behavioural interventions such as education and training do not increase the number of workers that use RPE or that use RPE correctly. We conclude that there is low to very low quality evidence that behavioural interventions do not encourage workers to use RPE correctly or more often. It is likely that our conclusions will change when new studies are published. We need better quality studies that look at the effectiveness of different types of interventions. These interventions should be targeted at both individuals and organisations, to improve effective RPE use. In addition, further studies should consider some of the barriers to the successful use of RPE, such as experience of health risk, types of RPE and the employer's attitude to RPE use.
We identified 11 studies, up to August 2020, for inclusion in the review. These studies included 42,226 participants. Three new trials have been added since the last update. As per the previous version of this review, two studies contributed 96% of the data. Most participants in the review were elderly, with a significant proportion over 70 years of age. Males and females were almost equally represented in the trials. There appeared to be some variation in stroke severity among the included trials. The scheduled duration of treatment varied from five days to three months and the scheduled follow-up period varied from 10 days to six months. Aspirin, at a dose of 160 mg to 300 mg daily, started within 48 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms, saved lives and reduced the risk of further stroke occurring in the first two weeks. If treatment was started more than 48 hours after onset but within 14 days, the limited evidence from this review and other external data suggest that aspirin is of benefit even starting at this late stage. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 160 mg to 300 mg daily, given orally (or by a tube through the nose and into the stomach or by the rectum in people who cannot swallow) and started within 48 hours of onset of presumed ischaemic stroke, reduced the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke without a major risk of early haemorrhagic complications; long-term outcomes were improved. Almost all the evidence in this review came from trials of aspirin. The quality of the evidence contributing to these results was generally good.
We reviewed randomized trials of reducing pain during IUC insertion through 22 June 2015. We found 33 studies with a total of 5710 women. Most were recent trials. Methods tested were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), lidocaine, misoprostol, and other treatments. Lidocaine 2% gel had no effect on pain during IUC insertion (three trials) or pain with tenaculum (type of forceps) placement (two trials). Other types of lidocaine showed some effect. Pain score for IUC insertion was lower with a lidocaine and prilocaine cream and with 10% lidocaine spray. With 4% lidocaine gel, pain scores were lower shortly after IUC insertion. With 1% lidocaine injection, pain score at tenaculum placement was lower compared with no intervention.
With four misoprostol trials, the pain score with IUC insertion was higher for misoprostol versus placebo ('dummy' treatment). Two other trials showed higher pain scores with misoprostol versus placebo either at IUC insertion or after. However, another study showed the misoprostol group had less serious IUC-insertion pain. Also, the misoprostol group rated the insertion more favorably. In analysis of four trials, cramping was more likely with misoprostol versus placebo. Within two other trials, the misoprostol group was more likely to have shivering, headache, or abdominal pain. In one study, the misoprostol group was less likely to choose the treatment again or recommend it.
Pain score during IUC insertion was lower for the opioid tramadol versus naproxen. In the same trial, pain was lower for naproxen versus placebo. The naproxen group was less likely than the placebo group to rate the experience as unpleasant and not want the treatment in the future. In another trial, women with several naproxen doses had lower pain scores after IUC insertion than the placebo group.
Overall, the effectiveness results were of moderate quality, having come from single studies. Trials of lidocaine, tramadol and naproxen showed some effect on reducing pain from IUC insertion.
This review appraised trials that evaluated whether feeding these infants with breast milk fortified with added nutrients rather than unfortified breast milk would increase growth rates and benefit development. We found only two small trials (involving 246 infants) of this intervention. These trials did not provide consistent evidence that multinutrient fortification affects growth rates during infancy. Further trials are needed to resolve this question and to assess long-term effects on growth and development.
This summary of an updated Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the benefits and harms of electrotherapy modalities in people with rotator cuff disease. After searching for all relevant studies published up to March 2015, we included 47 trials (2388 participants). Among the included participants, 67% were women, the average age was 53 years, and the average duration of the condition was eight months. Electrotherapy was delivered for three weeks on average.  Overall pain (lower scores mean greater pain reduction)
People who had ultrasound had greater pain reduction than people who had placebo. Reduction in pain was 8.60 points more (ranging from 3.72 to 13.48 points more) at six weeks (17% absolute improvement). On a scale of 0 to 52 points, people who had ultrasound rated their reduction in pain score as -14.9 points, and people who had placebo rated their reduction in pain score as -6.3 points.
Function (higher scores mean more improvement in function)
People who had ultrasound improved more than people who had placebo. Improvement in function was 14.10 points more (ranging from 5.39 to 22.81 points more) at six weeks (14% absolute improvement). On a scale of 0 to 100 points, people who had ultrasound rated their change in function as 17.8 points, and people who had placebo rated their change in function as 3.7 points.
Treatment success
Thirty-nine more people out of 100 rated their treatment as successful with ultrasound compared with placebo; 39% absolute improvement (ranging from 18% to 60% more improvement). Ninety-one out of 100 people reported treatment success with ultrasound and 52 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo.
Side effects
No participant receiving ultrasound or placebo reported side effects. Low-quality evidence suggests that therapeutic ultrasound may improve overall pain, function, global treatment success and quality of life more than placebo at short-term (six weeks) in people with calcific tendinitis, that LLLT may improve overall pain and function more than placebo at short-term (up to three weeks), that therapeutic ultrasound and LLLT may produce no clinically important additional benefits in pain and function when combined with other physical therapy interventions alone, and that PEMF may produce no clinically important benefits in pain and function when compared with placebo. Further high quality research is likely to change our confidence in the effect estimates.
We are uncertain whether TENS improves pain and function more than placebo, whether therapeutic ultrasound improves pain and function more than other active interventions (manual therapy, acupuncture, glucocorticoid injection, glucocorticoid injection plus oral tolmetin sodium, or exercise), or whether LLLT improves pain and function more than oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and glucocorticoid injection, because of the very low quality of the evidence.
Nine studies of medium to high quality, enrolling 1614 institutionalised participants or outpatients, assigned to antibiotics or placebo/no treatment for treating asymptomatic bacteriuria for different durations of treatment and follow-up were included in this review. The evidence is current to February 2015. No clinical benefit was found for antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics eradicated the growth of bacteria in more participants but at the cost of more adverse events than in the no treatment groups.
The evidence is current to the 7 August 2014. Of the eight studies identified, only one fulfilled the criteria for the review. This study assessed 146 participants over a three-month period. Half the participants took a placebo capsule and half took a garlic capsule during this time. The participants then wrote in a diary when they had symptoms of a cold. The included study found that people who took garlic every day for three months (instead of a placebo) had fewer colds. That is, over the three-month period, there were 24 occurrences of the common cold in the garlic group, compared to 65 in the placebo group. When participants experienced a cold, the length of illness was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63 days). More participants in the garlic group (four) than the placebo group (one) noted a smell when burping, so it is possible that blinding of participants was not adequate. However, other potential biases were well controlled. The only included study is directly relevant to the review question. Although the trial is small, there were enough participants to provide precise, reliable results. There is no evidence that results were selectively reported. However, this was possible as the outcomes do not appear to have been decided in advance. Considering the financial incentive for supplement companies to produce positive trials, it is also possible that trials that showed no effect of garlic were never published. Overall, the quality of the evidence is moderate. Possible side effects in this small trial included odour and a skin rash. More information is needed about the possible side effects of garlic.
The searches returned 19 relevant studies with a total of 30,747 participants. Eight studies were conducted in the USA, two were conducted in Spain, and one each in China, Colombia, Finland, France, Kenya, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Sweden, and Thailand. Six studies were conducted in preschools or day-care centres (children aged from birth to < five years), with the remaining 13 conducted in elementary or primary schools (children aged five to14 years). These studies were quite varied in the composition and application of the rinse-free hand washing program. Only two studies included information on the primary outcome (absenteeism due to any reason), whilst for absenteeism for any illness there were six studies that provided information. The evidence presented is up to date to February 2020. The application of, and adherence to a rinse-free hand wash, hand hygiene program may be associated with small, but potentially beneficial effects in reducing the number of days students were absent from school due to illness compared to no rinse-free hand wash, hygiene program. However rinse-free hand washing may be no different to controls at reducing absenteeism for any reason. There may also be no difference in the number of skin irritations between students who received the rinse-free hand wash compared to those who used soap and water. Most students and teachers responded favorably to using rinse-free hand wash and complied relatively well with its use. The certainty of the evidence included in this review was low or very low, mainly due to the included studies using poor methods, providing imprecise data, and being very inconsistent from one another. This means that we have low and very-low certainty, or confidence, in these results.
This review of 10 trials comparing either clopidogrel or ticlopidine with aspirin in about 27,000 people found that clopidogrel and ticlopidine were at least as effective as aspirin for the prevention of stroke and heart attacks, and might be slightly more effective. In terms of adverse effects, compared with aspirin, clopidogrel and ticlopidine caused less stomach upset and less bleeding from the gut, but more diarrhoea and skin rash. Ticlopidine produced more of these last two adverse effects than clopidogrel when compared with aspirin. Ticlopidine can also cause suppression of the bone marrow production of blood cells, which can be a serious complication. Clopidogrel is therefore the thienopyridine of choice since it is safer and better tolerated. However, since it is substantially more expensive than aspirin and not clearly more effective, it should generally only be used instead of aspirin in patients who are unable to take aspirin.
In July 2018, we searched for clinical trials about exercise to reduce falls in adults living with and beyond cancer. We found 11 studies of variable quality and size, including a total of 835 people, that compared exercise to usual care. Most of the studies were very small, four with fewer than 30 people. Only one study reported on accidental falls. All 11 studies reported on one or more measures that are risk factors for falling (e.g. strength, flexibility and balance). We rated the quality of the evidence from the studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. The quality of the evidence was very low to low across all of the measures of interest. There were several weaknesses identified in the design of all studies including small numbers of participants. No study could prevent participants knowing their treatment and so there could have been bias. Only one study looked at the effect of exercise on accidental falls and found no difference in number of falls between people who exercised and people who did not (very low-quality evidence). Therefore, there were insufficient data for conclusions to be drawn regarding the effects of exercise on reducing accidental falls for people living with and beyond cancer. There was improvement in some factors that are known to affect falls; we found improvement in some measures of strength, flexibility and balance, although the overall quality of this evidence was very low to low.
In human and animal studies however, spontaneous onset of labour is proven to have a circadian rhythm with preference for start in the evening. Moreover, when spontaneous labour starts in the evening, total duration of labour shortens and less obstetric interventions are needed. Based on these observations one might assume, that starting induction of labour in harmony with the circadian rhythm of natural birth is more beneficial. This review found three studies that were of high quality with a total of 1150 women randomly allocated to induction in the morning or the evening. One trial used intravenous oxytocin in women who had a dilated cervix or rupture of membranes and two trials used prostaglandins to induce labour. Prostaglandins are hormones used when the cervix is not ripe, intravenous oxytocin is mostly needed afterwards to really get labour started. Therefore, these two different methods, prostaglandins and intravenous oxytocin, rely on a different mechanism and were assessed separately. This review found no differences in effect between starting induction in morning or evening on outcomes for mother or child. The risk of a vaginal birth using instruments, or risk of a caesarian section and use of epidural anaesthesia did not clearly differ between groups. One study reported that women had a preference to start induction of labour with prostaglandins in the morning, and more women in the evening admission group did not like the interruptions to sleep that were associated with the induction protocol. This review, with only three studies with two different comparisons, concludes that induction of labour in the evening is as effective and safe as induction in the morning. However, given the preference of most women, administration of prostaglandins should preferably be done in the morning.
The update found three studies with about 600 patients which could be included in addition to the previous review which had 10 studies all in haemodialysis. The use of the direct-acting antivirals grazoprevir and elbasvir in combination produces a 100% response by the end of treatment, but follow-up data is not available, and evidence is not of high quality. The addition of ribavirin to interferon resulted in a better sustained response (being free of the virus in blood after treatment is stopped), decreased chances of disease relapse but more adverse events. Telaprevir along with ribavirin in different doses combined with pegylated (PEG) interferon in different doses and durations produce almost similar end-of-treatment and sustained response, but the evidence was not of high quality. PEG interferon was more effective than standard interferon in producing a short-term response but not a sustained one and both were equally tolerated. Increasing the dose of PEG interferon did not improve response but was tolerated. Limitations of this review are that only a few studies were available with few participants, and patients with serious disease were excluded from previous studies in anticipation of side effects. Hence, the evidence available was not of high quality. Evidence for the newer medicines namely direct-acting antivirals which have now replaced the use of interferons in the general population was limited and was not of high quality. This was an update of a review of available treatments for patients on dialysis having HCV infection. Direct-acting antivirals have now replaced the use of interferons for treatment. Grazoprevir and elbasvir produce an end-of-treatment response in almost all patients, but no data is available for a sustained response at follow-up, and the evidence is not of high quality. Combinations of telaprevir, ribavirin and PEG interferon used in different doses and durations are almost similar in efficacy, and the evidence is not of high quality. PEG interferon is more effective than standard interferon for producing a response by the end of treatment which is not sustained, both being equally tolerated. Increasing doses of PEG interferon does not improve responses, but high and low doses are equally tolerated. The addition of ribavirin produces an improved response even after stopping treatment but has higher adverse events.
We searched for randomised controlled trials on 30 June 2016 and 1 July 2016 and found 10 studies (23 reports) to include in our review. All the studies were of education and support for all mothers, not just those giving birth to more than one baby, which introduced methodological issues for looking specifically at multiple births. Trials recruited 5787 women (this included 512 women interviewed as part of a cluster randomised trial). The number of babies from multiple pregnancies was small and none of the studies had sufficient numbers to provide information about how interventions worked for mothers of multiples. There were several problems with how the studies had been done, including women knowing if they were in the group getting support.
The authors of two of the studies sent us their findings for women with multiple births (42 women in total). The trials compared home nurse visits versus usual care (15 women), and telephone peer counselling versus usual care (27 women). They looked at the number of women stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding before four weeks after giving birth and before six months, without any clear improvements provided by the intervention. All 15 women in one study and 25 out of 27 women in the other had started breastfeeding. There was no information on breast milk expression. Other outcome measures were reported, including a measure of maternal satisfaction in one study of 15 women, but there were not sufficient numbers to allow us to draw any conclusions. No adverse events were reported. We could not draw conclusions from the evidence available from randomised controlled trials about whether education and support helps mothers of multiples to breastfeed. None of the studies were designed to offer tailored support or education to women who give birth to more than one baby. More research is needed to find out what types of education and support could help mothers of multiples to breastfeed their babies. Data from these studies should be presented and analysed in an appropriate way for multiple babies.
A review of trials found that in infants at high risk of allergy who are unable to completely breastfeed, there is no reduction in allergies in later infancy and childhood associated with feeding soy formula compared to a cow's milk formula. No eligible studies were found that compared a soy with a hydrolysed protein formula.
We investigated whether giving DDAVP reduced the need for blood transfusion in people having surgery.
We searched the medical literature to 3 April 2017. We identified 65 relevant trials with 3874 participants (adults and children). All trials assessed the effects of giving DDAVP before, during, or immediately after surgery or more minor procedures like biopsies. Most trials focused on adult heart surgery, or bone and joint surgery. Fewer trials focused on heart surgery for children, plastic surgery, surgery on blood vessels, or liver surgery. The trials were conducted between 1986 and 2016. Eleven were funded by pharmaceutical companies or by a party with a commercial interest in the trial’s outcome. Compared with placebo (an inactive substance that looks the same as the substance being tested, i.e. DDAVP) or no treatment, DDAVP may slightly reduce the amount of blood transfused in adult heart surgery. DDAVP may lead to little or no difference in the amount of blood transfused in heart surgery for children, bone and joint surgery, surgery on major blood vessels, or liver surgery. DDAVP probably leads to little or no difference in the total number of people who receive a blood transfusion. Whether DDAVP increases or reduces total blood loss is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low. DDAVP may lead to little or no difference in the risk of death, heart attack, or stroke.
For people who are more vulnerable to bleeding because they are taking an antiplatelet medicine that stops their blood from clotting normally, DDAVP may lead to a reduction in the total volume of red cells transfused and in total blood loss. It probably leads to little or no difference in the number of people receiving a red cell transfusion. Whether DDAVP increases or reduces the risk of death, heart attack, or stroke is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low.
Compared with tranexamic acid (a medication used to treat or prevent excessive blood loss) DDAVP may be less effective in reducing the volume of blood transfused and total blood loss. Whether DDAVP increases or reduces the number of people who receive a blood transfusion, or risk of death, heart attack, or stroke is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low.
Compared with aprotinin (another medication used to reduce bleeding) DDAVP probably increases the number of people who receive a blood transfusion. Whether it increases or decreases the risk of a heart attack or stroke is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low. No trials comparing DDAVP against aprotinin reported the volume of blood transfused, total blood loss, or risk of death.
None of the 65 trials assessed quality of life. We rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate for the outcomes above. We considered many of the trials to be at high risk of bias and noted inconsistency and imprecision in their results. Overall, differences in transfusion and blood loss when people were treated with DDAVP or placebo were small and unlikely to be clinically important. It is possible that people who are more vulnerable to bleeding, such as those taking antiplatelet agents, may gain more benefit from DDAVP. Few trials compared DDAVP against tranexamic acid or aprotinin; consequently, we are uncertain whether DDAVP is better or worse than these agents.
We could only include one small study in the review (14 participants) and this was stopped early because not enough people agreed to join the study as volunteers. The study lasted six months and compared omalizumab (Xolair®) injections under the skin of the upper arm or the thigh to placebo injections (dummy treatment containing no active medication). Volunteers were given of 600 mg of omalizumab or placebo daily along with itraconazole (an antifungal drug) twice daily and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. The full results of the study were not published. Only limited results on side effects were published online. Six out of nine volunteers (66.67%) in the omalizumab group and one out of five volunteers (20%) in the placebo group reported one or more serious side effects.
Due to the lack of evidence, we are not able to make recommendations either in favour of, or against the use of, anti-IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. More research into this treatment is needed.
We wanted to assess whether any pharmacological intervention can prevent VTE in people undergoing bariatric surgery, and whether these interventions are safe. We searched for studies that examined the effect of any medicine for preventing VTE in people undergoing bariatric surgery, compared with the same medicine at a different dose, or given more or less often, or started at a different time point; or compared with a different medicine; or compared with no treatment or placebo (dummy treatment). We also included combinations of interventions.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size. We found seven studies involving 1045 people who underwent bariatric surgery. The studies provided information about four different comparisons:
1) heparin at a higher dose versus the same heparin at a standard dose; 
2) heparin versus a pentasaccharide; 
3) heparin started before versus after the surgical procedure; and
4) combined mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis versus mechanical prophylaxis alone.
Four studies provided information for the first comparison: one assessed unfractionated heparin (which is given by a medical professional and wears off quickly) and three assessed low-molecular-weight heparin (which patients can inject themselves and which lasts longer). There was one study for each of the other three comparisons.
Heparin at a higher dose compared to a standard dose may make little or no difference to the risk of VTE or major bleeding in people undergoing bariatric surgery. The evidence on death, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and the side effect thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count) is uncertain.
Heparin compared with pentasaccharide may make little or no difference to the risk of VTE or deep vein thrombosis in people undergoing bariatric surgery. The evidence on major bleeding, death, pulmonary embolism and side effects (thrombocytopenia, irregular heartbeat, rash and nausea and vomiting) is uncertain.
Heparin before compared with after surgery may make little or no difference to the risk of VTE or deep vein thrombosis in people undergoing bariatric surgery. The evidence on major bleeding and death is uncertain. The study did not measure pulmonary embolism or harmful side effects.
Mechanical prophylaxis plus pharmacological prophylaxis compared to mechanical prophylaxis alone may decrease the risk of VTE and deep vein thrombosis in people undergoing bariatric surgery. The evidence on major bleeding and death is uncertain. The study did not measure pulmonary embolism or harmful side effects.
No studies measured the effect of any intervention on quality of life. Although there is some evidence on the effects of heparins, pentasaccharides and mechanical combined with pharmacological prophylaxis for preventing VTE in people undergoing bariatric surgery, we are still not sure which intervention works best. We have little or very little confidence in the evidence because the studies were of low quality. Many participants dropped out from one study, there were a low number of events overall, and most studies had few participants. Larger studies assessing important outcomes (e.g. VTE, major bleeding, death due to any cause, death due to VTE, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, harmful side effects and quality of life) are needed to assess which medicines are more effective and safer and at which dose they should be used. This evidence is up-to-date to November 2021.
We included studies comparing the effects of iron compared with no iron when given at least five days per week to menstruating women. We identified 67 trials recruiting 8506 women eligible for inclusion in the review. Most trials lasted between one and three months. The most commonly used iron form was ferrous sulphate. We found evidence that iron supplements reduce the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency, and raise levels of haemoglobin in the blood and in iron stores. Iron supplementation clearly increases the risk of side effects, for example, constipation and abdominal pain. We found high quality evidence that iron improves haemoglobin and produces changes in bowel function, but moderate quality evidence that iron reduces the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency. Evidence of the effects of iron on other outcomes, such as abdominal pain, is of low quality. There are no data on the effects of iron on mortality in this population group.
Further definitive studies are needed to identify whether taking iron supplements orally for at least five days a week has an impact on key, health-related outcomes.
The evidence reviewed is current to August 2016. We included nine studies with a total of 407 participants in the review. All of the participants had asthma. In three of the nine studies, the participants also had a diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or both. The CBT was given either individually or in a group and ranged from four to 15 sessions. Participants given CBT had improved scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and on measures of asthma control compared to participants who did not receive CBT. The studies generally did not report whether CBT reduced the likelihood of people needing oral steroids for an asthma attack. The benefit on AQLQ score was sustained up to a year after receiving CBT. Participants given CBT also had better anxiety scores compared to those given usual care. Participants given CBT did not have clearly improved depression scale scores or medication adherence.
The overall quality of evidence presented is low due to the small number of studies included in the review, the differences in the design of the studies and in how the CBT was conducted, and because the participants knew to which treatment group (CBT or no CBT) they had been assigned.
Three randomized controlled trials were included involving 339 women of reproductive age who required IVF treatment due to tubal factor infertility, anovulation, male factor infertility, endometriosis or fertility of unknown cause. These studies compared the outcome of IVF cycles in women whose cyst was drained versus the outcomes when the cyst was not drained. The evidence was current to April 2014. None of the included studies reported live birth rates or adverse event rates. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference in the pregnancy rate, the number of follicles recruited, or the number of eggs retrieved, between women who had their cyst drained and women who did not. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons, the main reasons for this being small study numbers, low numbers of events and poor reporting of study methods. There was inconsistent reporting of study findings in one RCT, which meant that some of the data could not be used
This is an update of a Cochrane Review. The aim was to find out whether approaches such as behavioural and cognitive-behavioural therapies are helpful in reducing aggressive behaviour in children and adults with intellectual disabilities. To identify relevant studies, we searched medical databases and registries of clinical trials up to March 2022 and references of retrieved papers. Two review authors independently screened the titles of papers for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed study limitations. When necessary, we contacted trial authors to request additional information. We included 15 studies using a range of different therapies with a total of 921 participants in the review; nine studies are new to this update. Most studies took place in community settings and one was carried out in a high-security hospital setting. Thirteen studies were small and included between 12 and 63 participants and there were two large studies of 179 and 245 participants.
The evidence that we found suggests that:
– compared to a waiting list or no treatment, anger management based on cognitive behaviour therapy is likely to reduce aggressive behaviour and possibly might improve ability to control anger, ability to carry out activities of daily living and psychiatric symptoms. However, there is not enough evidence at present about whether it improves quality of life or reduces service use and costs.
– compared with treatment as usual, PBS is likely to reduce aggressive behaviour, but there is a lack of evidence that it improves mental health symptoms or reduces service use.
– compared to a waiting list, mindfulness might reduce incidents of aggression.
– compared to a PBS only, mindfulness-based PBS might reduce incidents of aggression. We were moderately certain about the effects of anger management and PBS on reducing aggressive behaviour but less certain for the other outcomes. Most studies were very small, with only two large studies and there is not enough evidence yet to say confidently which approaches are better are reducing aggressive behaviour. The review is up to date to March 2022.
This review of randomized trials found that the use of surgical sealants seems to reduce postoperative air leaks and length of hospitalization. Nevertheless, more and larger randomized trials are needed to clearly determine the effects of surgical sealants, especially on length of hospitalization.
We wanted to find out how well botulinum toxin could treat wrinkles on the face, and if it causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that tested the effects of botulinum toxin to treat wrinkles on the face. We found 65 studies in 14,919 people (mostly women) who went to a day clinic or private office for treatment. The studies lasted from one week to one year; the average length of treatment was 20 weeks. The studies compared one type of botulinum toxin against another type, against a placebo (an injection that did not contain any botulinum toxin), or against an alternative treatment. Several studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies.
The studies tested four types of botulinum toxin that were licensed for use and some other types that were not yet licensed.
All studies assessed the success of treatment by measuring wrinkles and lines when facial muscles were at their most tense. Most studies treated wrinkles that develop between the eyebrows, known as 'glabellar lines'. At four weeks after injection, all types of botulinum toxin reduced glabellar lines more than a placebo. This effect was seen whether the wrinkles were assessed by doctors or by the people who had the injections.
Unwanted effects are probably more common with botulinum toxin than with placebo injections. The most commonly reported unwanted effects are drooping eyelids, squinting (when the eyes point in different directions) and numbness of the eyelid.
Two studies compared two different types of botulinum toxin and found no difference between the types for how well they reduced glabellar lines. Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to high that botulinum toxin reduces wrinkles between the eyebrows better than a placebo. We are less confident in some of the evidence for other comparisons or studies, because some studies enrolled only a small number of people, and in some studies it was unclear how people were assigned to different treatment groups or if people knew which treatment they received. Further research is likely to increase our confidence in the evidence. The evidence is current up to May 2020.
We found 40 studies that involved 3718 adults and 178 adolescents. The majority of studies included participants with a kidney transplant. We found that the types of interventions varied across the studies, and 27 studies included more than one approach to increase immunosuppressant medication adherence. We found some evidence to support the effectiveness of interventions to increase taking the correct dosage of medication. It was unclear whether using an intervention increased adherence to immunosuppressant medication following a solid organ transplant. It was also unclear if interventions affected concentrations of immunosuppressant medication in the blood, rates of transplant rejection, death, the need for hospital admission and health-related quality of life. There was low confidence in the information about the effects of interventions as some studies were small, the types of interventions varied, and studies defined and measured medication adherence in different ways. We didn't find enough information to assess whether certain types of interventions were more effective than other types. Our findings suggest that the current research evidence examining interventions to increase adherence to immunosuppressant therapy is of low quality, attributable to variability in the type of intervention delivered, the overall low number of participants receiving the intervention, and significant variation in how medication adherence is defined and measured. Existing data provided information that indicated the possible benefits of the interventions for increasing adherence in terms of taking medication and taking the correct dose. No harms related to intervention participation were identified. There are 24 studies either yet to be completed or final results published that weren't included in this review, so a future update of this review may show more certainty in whether an intervention can increase adherence to immunosuppressant medication following a solid organ transplant.
In this review, we included studies that were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing progressive resistive exercise interventions with no progressive resistive exercise or another exercise or treatment modality, performed at least three times per week, and lasting at least four weeks among adults (18 years of age or older) living with HIV/AIDS. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Progressive resistive exercise or a combination of progressive resistive exercise and aerobic exercise appear to be safe and may be beneficial for adults living with HIV/AIDS. These findings are limited by the small number of studies that could be included in meta-analyses, small sample sizes and variable participant withdrawal rates among included studies. Future research would benefit from including participants at various stages of HIV infection, a greater proportion of female participants, and participants in a variety of age groups to increase the generalizability of results. Furthermore, future research would benefit from studies with larger sample sizes that conduct an "intention-to-treat" analysis (analysis of participants based on the groups to which they were originally allocated) to better understand outcomes of participants that withdraw from exercise interventions.
We included 11 studies in this review, with a total of 855 participants. Nine studies looked at post-treatment postural restrictions (using a neck brace/head movement restrictions/instructions to sleep upright) following the Epley manoeuvre. There was a statistically significant difference found when these restrictions were compared to a control treatment of the Epley manoeuvre alone. Although there was a difference between the groups, adding postural restrictions conferred only a small additional benefit since the Epley manoeuvre was effective alone in just under 80% of patients. Four of the studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV (a subtype of BPPV which is similar to posterior canal BPPV, but has some distinct differences in terms of the signs and symptoms), dizziness and disequilibrium (the feeling of unsteadiness on ones feet) in some patients.
Additionally, two studies looked into the application of oscillation/vibration to the mastoid region during the Epley manoeuvre compared to control; the intervention produced no difference in outcome between these groups. One study that also researched post-treatment postural restrictions looked into extra steps in the Epley manoeuvre. Compared to the control treatment there were no significant differences in outcomes.
No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the studies in the review. The results should be interpreted carefully and further trials are needed.
We identified 31 studies to July 2015 for inclusion in the review. These included a total of 2257 participants who had had a stroke more than one month previously. They all investigated acupuncture aimed at promoting recovery compared with no acupuncture or sham acupuncture. Outcomes included measures of daily activities (activities of daily living), neurological function, movement, cognition, depression, swallowing, pain, and quality of life. Most of the studies (29/31) were conducted in China; the studies varied considerably with respect to the time of stroke, specific techniques used, and the frequency of acupuncture. We found some evidence that acupuncture improved activities of daily living and a number of aspects of neurological function. However, these conclusions were based on studies with low quality evidence. No serious side effects were reported and there was no information on the effects of acupuncture on death or the need for institutional care. It proved difficult to reliably determine the quality of the evidence because of poor reporting of study characteristics. Therefore, we have described most conclusions as having low or very low quality evidence.
We searched for evidence on 31 January 2020 and found seven RCTs, six of which provided data on 1610 women and their babies. These studies were all undertaken in income-rich countries. The certainty of the evidence was mostly very low, mainly because of the limited number of studies, some of which were small, and there was lack of clarity in the study design.
The women all received the induction with initial monitoring in hospital. Women in the home induction group were then able to go home to wait for the start of active labour, or for a set period of time. Women in the inpatient group stayed in hospital.
With vaginal prostaglandin (PGE2) for induction, we found two studies with 1022 women and their babies. There may be little or no difference in women's satisfaction between waiting for labour to become active at home or in hospital, although women tended to be more satisfied with going home to wait. For women, there may be no clear differences in the number who had a spontaneous vaginal birth, overstimulation of the uterus or a caesarean birth. For the babies, there may be a similar incidence of infection and admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The costs may possibly be less in home settings.
For induction with controlled release prostaglandin (PGE2) into the vagina, we found just one study of 299 women and their babies but the findings indicate probably little or no difference.
Using a balloon or Foley catheter for induction, we found three studies providing data on 289 women and their babies. Two studies reported on women’s satisfaction, and showed a tendency to favour home settings, but the way data were collected was unclear. There may be little or no difference in the number of spontaneous vaginal births, overstimulation of uterine contractions and babies admitted to NICU. Home induction may possibly reduce the number of caesarean births but more data are needed. The studies did not include sufficient numbers of women and babies to show clear differences in outcomes between home and inpatient induction of labour, and the certainty of the evidence was generally very low. More studies are needed, and further studies are already underway. We need more data on women's experiences and views on their care, as well as on safety and cost.
The evidence is current to March 2021. We included five trials randomising 580 participants. The five trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. We included five trials: one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam.
None of the five antibiotic comparisons showed that the choice of antibiotics influenced the effects on death from all-causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), or necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject, one antibiotic regimen being superior to another due to scarce data. Our conclusions are based on very low-quality evidence. The five trials were at high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise.
This review wanted to find out if there was evidence to support that there is any difference between ziprasidone and the other atypical medications. Because of the large number of people that dropped out of the studies it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions, however, people taking ziprasidone did not do as well regarding their symptoms, as those taking olanzapine and risperidone and perhaps amisulpride, but they were less likely to gain weight.
This review looked at all studies where patients were randomized to one of these drugs or placebo, in this period. One class of blood pressure lowering drug, the so-called nitrates, demonstrated reduction in mortality in patients with heart attack. For 1000 patients treated 4 to 8 deaths were prevented during the first 2 days of this acute event. The ACE-inhibitors class also decrease mortality when continued for 10 days (3 to 5 deaths prevented per 1000). No other class of drug showed a reduction in mortality.
We searched the databases to September 2012, to find controlled trials that had randomly assigned obese participants (with body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2) undergoing general anaesthesia to TT or SAD for airway management. We wanted to investigate the effect of airway type on risk of failed placement; serious complications and death; oxygenation of the blood during and after surgery; coughing, sore throat or hoarseness during or after placement; and time taken and number of attempts needed to fit the airway.
We found two randomized studies with a total of 232 obese participants, both of which studied one model of SAD－the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA). No relevant outcomes for death or other serious complications occurred in these studies.We found that in 3% to 5% of obese participants, it was not possible to fit a PLMA, and a change of device to a TT was required. The proportion of successful first attempts at airway placement did not differ between PLMA and TT, although it took approximately six seconds longer to place an SAD than a TT. We found significant postoperative reduction of almost 75% in episodes of low oxygen saturation and an improvement in mean oxygen saturation of 2.5% during recovery in the PLMA group. Postoperative cough was less common among participants in the PLMA group. Our findings are consistent with both increased and decreased risks of both sore throat and hoarseness in the PLMA group.
Identifying optimal anaesthetic techniques for obese patients is a priority for research. We could not establish the safety of SAD use in obese patients. Large databases created from medical records may be needed to clarify this issue.
We wanted to find out if giving probiotics to babies born from 35 weeks of pregnancy who underwent stomach or bowel surgery could improve rates of infection, length of hospital stay, rates of death, feeding, and the proportion of 'good' bacteria in the stomach and bowel. We searched for studies that randomly assigned babies to experimental treatment (probiotics) or a control, which could be placebo (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks or tastes the same as the medicine being tested) or no treatment. We found one small study of 61 babies born from 35 weeks of pregnancy who had digestive tract surgery. Thirty babies received probiotics after the surgery, and 30 received a placebo.
In the probiotics group, 13% of babies had a blood infection, compared with 19% in the placebo group. This difference is too small to be significant.
On average, the babies in the probiotic group were receiving food into their stomach about 15 hours sooner than those in the placebo group. Again, this difference is not important.
Among 39 infants who were tested, those in the probiotics group had considerably more 'good' bacteria in their bowel compared to the placebo group. We have little confidence in the evidence because it is based on a single study with few participants. The evidence is not strong enough to support giving probiotics routinely. Well-designed and large studies are needed to determine the benefits and harms of giving probiotics to newborns after digestive tract surgery. The evidence is up to date to August 2023.
Twelve trials including 794 participants acute Achilles tendon rupture were included. The majority of participants were male, and the average ages of the study populations were between 36 to 41 years. Many of the trials had flawed methods that undermined the reliability of their results.
Open surgical treatment compared with non-surgical treatment (6 studies, 502 participants) was associated with a lower risk of rerupture, but a higher risk of other complications such as infection, adhesions and disturbed skin sensibility (numbness and tingling). There were insufficient and inconclusive data on function and sporting activities.
Percutaneous repair (involving stab incisions through which the repair suture is passed through without direct exposure of the tendon) compared with open repair (4 studies, 174 participants) was associated with a lower risk of infection. These figures should be interpreted with caution because of the small numbers involved. Similarly, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding different tendon repair techniques (3 studies, 141 participants).
Ganglioside treatment has been tested in many clinical trials, mostly on patients with stroke. The results of these studies were inconclusive. This review shows that there is no evidence in favour of this treatment for patients with acute stroke. Gangliosides can rarely cause damage to nerves (acute neuropathy).
We included a total of 11 studies recruiting 5862 apparently healthy adults in this review. The findings of the review indicate that using technologies to support adults' attempts to become more active, achieve the recommended weekly amounts of activity, or become fitter are successful. Changes can be achieved with help from a trained professional and through personal support via telephone, e-mail, or written information. New physical activity can be maintained for at least one year and it does not increase the risk of falls or exercise related injuries. More research is needed to establish which methods of exercise promotion encourage specific groups of people to be more physically active in the long term.
The review of trials found that acyclovir reduces the number of days of fever from chickenpox in otherwise healthy children, usually without adverse effects. It is not clear whether it improves sores and itching.
We searched for randomised controlled trials published in any language up to June 2019. We identified five randomised controlled trials with a total of 2545 participants with sore throat in primary care settings. Participants in the rapid test group were less likely to be prescribed antibiotics than participants managed based on clinical grounds (481/1197 versus 865/1348). A 25% reduction (i.e., a decrease of 25 percentage points) in antibiotic prescription rates is likely to be achieved by using rapid testing in people with sore throat in primary care. However, there may be little or no reduction between groups in dispensed antibiotic treatments. Antibiotic prescriptions refer to medicines prescribed by healthcare providers. Antibiotic dispensing refers to medicines accessed in pharmacies. In some cases, patients may not present to the pharmacy to get their prescription filled. Four trials reported data on the number of participants with a complication attributed to the initial infection (e.g., tonsil abscess): complications were rare (0 to 3 per trial), and there may be little or no difference between people managed on clinical grounds alone and those managed with rapid testing but the evidence is very uncertain. We ranked the certainty of the evidence as moderate for the number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription, low for the number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed, and very low for the number of participants with a complication attributed to the episode of sore throat (e.g., abscess of the tonsils), respectively. Compared with usual decision-making based on clinical examination alone, implementing rapid tests can reduce antibiotic prescription rates, but may have little or no impact on antibiotic dispensing. More studies are needed to assess other outcomes that are important to patients, including safety.
The two randomised controlled trials included in this review tested arthroplasty versus internal fixation in a total of 148 mainly female and older participants. Both trials had methodological flaws that may affect the validity of their results and there was a general lack of evidence on long-term effects. One of the trials found a longer length of surgery for the arthroplasty and both trials found an increased need for blood transfusion for the arthroplasty. Pooled data from the two trials showed no statistically significant differences between the two procedures for reoperations, wound healing complications or mortality at one year. Neither trial found a significant difference in longer-term function.
Overall, the evidence from the two small trials comparing these two approaches for treating extracapsular hip fractures was too limited to make any definite conclusions as to which is better.
We reviewed the effects of thioridazine and found many trials suggesting that it seems to be as effective as other commonly used antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia, but also justification for guidelines encouraging heart monitoring for people prescribed this drug. Where possible, we would advocate choosing other drugs in place of thioridizine.
We searched up to April 2017 and included 36 trials that involved 17,206 adults who received 200 mg celecoxib daily (9402 participants), or either another drug (naproxen - 6 trials, or diclofenac - 3 trials, total of 1869 participants) or a fake treatment (placebo - 32 trials, 5935 participants).
On average, participants were aged 62 years and had osteoarthritis for 7.9 years. Participants had knee, hip, or both, osteoarthritis; most were women and white. Most studies (34/36) were funded by the studied drugs manufacturers, and (34/36) included authors who worked for drug companies. Celecoxib, compared with placebo, slightly reduced pain, improved physical function, and probably did not increase numbers of people who withdrew from trials because of problems with the treatment. However, these results were unlikely to be clinically significant. Very low quality evidence meant that we are uncertain if celecoxib caused harms, such as gut or heart problems when compared with placebo. However, drug regulatory agencies have warned of increased risk of heart problems with celecoxib.
Celecoxib and tNSAIDs reduced pain by the same amount; celecoxib slightly improved physical function compared with tNSAIDs. Evidence comparing celecoxib and tNSAIDs was low to very low quality, so it is uncertain if harms (such as heart or gut problems) occurred from taking these drugs.
None of the high-quality studies assessed quality of life. Evidence quality was poor and results should be interpreted cautiously. Because it is known that sponsorship by the manufacturing drug company may lead to more favorable results and conclusions than sponsorship from other sources, we are highly reserved about results due to significant drug industry involvement and few data.
We were unable to obtain data from three trials which included 15,539 participants (awaiting assessment); Pfizer declined to provide data for two reports that involved 14,042 participants.
We need access to all trials results to better understand the benefits and harms of celecoxib and other treatments. New trials researching benefits and harms of celecoxib versus tNSAIDs for people with osteoarthritis, that have longer follow-up periods, more direct comparisons with other tNSAIDs, and funded by non-commercial sources, are needed.
This systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence for use of STI as an alternative strategy in the management of chronic suppressed HIV infection. STI is a planned, experimental intervention, and the evidence from 33 available intervention trials has been summarized. Currently, several large STI trials are underway, investigating long-term effects of STI strategies. Their results will be available in a few years. Based on the studies we reviewed, we find that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of STI as a standard of care in the management of chronic suppressed HIV infection.
We did not find any completed randomised trials testing these drugs in people with carotid artery dissection. However, there is one ongoing trial. We found only poor quality non-randomised studies that compared anticoagulants with aspirin. There was no evidence that anticoagulants were better than aspirin. Aspirin is likely to be similarly effective and safe as anticoagulants in such patients. More research is needed.
This is an updated review of 24 trials enrolling 7293 participants. Twenty randomized controlled trials compared bisphosphonates with either placebo or no treatment and four randomized controlled trials involved another bisphosphonate as a comparator. Use of bisphosphonates in participants with multiple myeloma did not improve overall survival or disease progression-free survival. Use of bisphosphonates in participants with multiple myeloma reduces overall fractures, fractures of the vertebra but not the non-vertebral fractures. Bisphosphonates also alleviates pain without many side effects except a significant increase in reduced blood flow to bones of the jaw resulting in decay of the bone also called osteonecrosis. Overall, for every 1000 participants treated with bisphosphonates, about one patient will suffer from the osteonecrosis of the jaw. Zoledronate was found to be better than etidronate and placebo, but not superior to pamidronate or clodronate for improving overall survival and other outcomes such as fractures in general or specifically fractures of vertebra. There was no evidence of superiority of any specific aminobisphosphonate (zoledronate, pamidronate or ibandronate) or non-aminobisphosphonate (etidronate or clodronate) for any outcome. The overall quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low indicating the need for more research on this issue and specifically randomized controlled trials comparing different bisphosphonates directly instead of no treatment or placebo.
After searching for all relevant studies, we found 11 studies that included 4531 adults with chronic gout. Two studies compared various doses of allopurinol (ranging from 100 to 300 mg daily) with placebo; four compared allopurinol with febuxostat; two compared allopurinol with benzbromarone; and one study each compared allopurinol with colchicine or probenecid. Two studies compared different treatment doses or administration methods of allopurinol. We considered allopurinol compared with placebo as the main comparison, and present results fully below.  Acute gout attacks (4% absolute reduction).
- 8 people out of 100 had an acute gout attack with allopurinol.
- 12 people out of 100 had an acute gout attack with placebo.
Proportion of participants achieving target serum urate
- 96 more people out of 100 achieved the target serum urate level with allopurinol (96% absolute increase).
- 96 people out of 100 achieved target serum urate with allopurinol.
- 0 people out of 100 achieved target serum urate with placebo.
Withdrawal due to adverse events
- 2 more people out of 100 had a withdrawal due to an adverse event with allopurinol (2% absolute increase).
- 6 people out of 100 had a withdrawal due to an adverse event with allopurinol.
- 4 people out of 100 had a withdrawal due to an adverse event with placebo.
Serious adverse events
- 1 more person out of 100 had a serious adverse event with allopurinol (1% absolute increase).
- 2 people out of 100 had a serious adverse event with allopurinol.
- 1 person out of 100 had a serious adverse event with placebo.
Pain, function and tophus regression were not reported in sufficient detail to present results. In people with chronic gout, moderate-quality evidence indicated that, compared with placebo, allopurinol (100 to 300 mg daily) probably does not reduce the number of acute gout attacks, but does increase the proportion achieving target serum urate levels, without increasing withdrawals due to AEs or serious adverse event rates. Further research may change the estimates. Pain and tophus regression were not reported sufficiently to calculate group differences. Function was not measured.
In people with chronic gout, compared with febuxostat (80 mg daily), low-quality evidence indicated that allopurinol (100 to 300 mg daily) may not reduce the number of acute gout attacks, and may be less effective in achieving target serum urate levels, without increasing withdrawals due to AEs, or serious adverse event rates. Further research is likely to change the estimates. Tophus regression was not reported sufficiently to calculate group differences. Pain and function were not measured.
In people with chronic gout, compared with benzbromarone (up to 200 mg daily), allopurinol (up to 600 mg daily) may not reduce the number of acute gout attacks (low-quality evidence), probably does not increase the proportion achieving target serum urate levels, or the withdrawals due to AEs or serious adverse event rates (moderate-quality evidence). Further research may change the estimates. Tophus regression was not reported sufficiently to calculate group differences and pain and function were not measured.
The evidence was downgraded due to limitations in study design indicating potential bias, and possible imprecision. All other comparisons were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.
We wanted to find out if pre-emptive treatment aimed at transplant recipients who are at risk of developing CMV disease, rather than administering universal prophylaxis, including those who are unlikely to develop CMV disease, prevents the development of CMV disease, death and adverse events. We searched for all trials that assessed the benefits and harms of pre-emptive treatment with antiviral agents in preventing CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as trial methods and size. We found 22 studies involving 1883 people (adults and children) who had received a kidney, liver, heart, lung, or kidney-pancreas transplant. Studies were conducted in Australia, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Spain, South Korea, and the USA. The number of people enrolled ranged from 12 to 296. Studies compared pre-emptive treatment with placebo or standard care (7 studies), pre-emptive treatment versus antiviral prophylaxis (12), pre-emptive oral versus intravenous ganciclovir treatment (1), pre-emptive valganciclovir versus pre-emptive ganciclovir (1), and two different pre-emptive dosing strategies of letermovir (1).
Compared to placebo or standard care, pre-emptive treatment probably reduces the risk of CMV disease but may make little or no difference to death, other organs being affected by CMV, CMV symptoms, acute rejection (the body's immune system attacking the transplanted organ), loss of the transplanted organ, other infections or low white blood cells.
Compared to antiviral prophylaxis, pre-emptive treatment may make little or no difference to the risk of developing CMV disease and probably makes little or no difference to the risk of death. CMV infection may increase with pre-emptive treatment, while the risk of low white blood cells probably decreases. There may be little or no difference in the risks of acute rejection, graft loss, and infections other than CMV. We are moderately confident that, compared to placebo or standard care, pre-emptive treatment reduces the risk of CMV disease; however, we are less confident in the results for other outcomes.
We are moderately confident that, compared to antiviral prophylaxis, pre-emptive treatment probably reduces the risk of low white blood cells; however, we are less confident pre-emptive treatment may increase the risk of CMV infection. The evidence is current to 17 December 2024.
We identified two trials, with 333 participants in total, which investigated the effectiveness on good clinical outcome of iron chelation therapy with deferoxamine for acute stroke. Both trials studied the effect in people who had bleeding in the brain, a subset of acute stroke. With the limitation that studies could not be pooled, the data did not show any difference in good neurological outcome between groups. Both studies reported that administration of deferoxamine was safe. Oedema formation around the haematoma was slightly reduced in the deferoxamine group in one study, but not in the other. The certainty of the evidence for the use of deferoxamine for the improvement of neurological outcome in spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage is low. This is based on two small studies with short follow-up, and with differences in outcome measurement. Limited evidence was available regarding side effects. The added value of iron-chelating therapy in people with ischaemic stroke or subarachnoid haemorrhage remains unknown.
One study reported a statistically significant reduction in the average anxiety during the waiting period for women who had had a rapid test, but the other found no difference between the two groups. There was also no evidence to support the view that issuing amniocentesis results as soon as they are available is more user friendly than informing women on a pre-defined fixed date.
The results remain inconclusive and, therefore, for the time being the choice of communication strategies should be influenced by clinical arguments and cost-effectiveness rather than impact on anxiety. Studies evaluating the effect of different strategies for disclosing results on women anxiety for chorionic villous sampling are needed.
There are beds, mattresses and mattress toppers specifically designed for people at risk of pressure ulcers. These can be made of a range of materials (such as foam, air cells or water bags) and are divided into two groups:
- reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin, unless a person moves or is repositioned; and
- active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body.
We wanted to find out if reactive surfaces that are not air-filled or made of foam:
- prevent pressure ulcers;
- are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
- have health benefits that outweigh their costs; and
- have any unwanted effects. We searched the medical literature for studies that evaluated the effects of beds, mattresses and mattress toppers with a reactive surface that was not air-filled or made of foam. We compared and summarised the results of these studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 20 studies (4653 people, average age: 73 years) that lasted between seven days and six months (average: four weeks). The studies compared reactive surfaces filled with water or gel, or made of fibre, against other active or reactive surfaces.
In general, the studies did not provide sufficiently robust evidence for us to determine if reactive surfaces that are not air-filled or made of foam prevent pressure ulcers.
Evidence from two studies suggests that people who undergo surgery may be more likely to develop pressure ulcers when they lie on an operating table with a reactive gel surface and then a hospital bed with a foam surface, rather than on active air-filled surfaces.
The other benefits and risks of gel and other reactive surfaces are unclear. No studies reported information about quality of life and cost. Most studies were small (198 people on average) and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019.
We have used data from 46 trials (20 oseltamivir and 26 zanamivir studies) in this review. We identified problems in the design of many of the studies that we included, which affects our confidence in their results. We found that both drugs shorten the duration of symptoms of influenza-like illness (unconfirmed influenza or 'the flu') by less than a day. Oseltamivir did not affect the number of hospitalisations, based on the data from all the people enrolled in treatment trials of oseltamivir. Zanamivir trials did not record this outcome. The effects on pneumonia and other complications of influenza, such as bronchitis, middle ear infection (otitis media) and sinusitis, were unreliably reported, as shown by the case report form in the trial documents. Some forms showed limitations in the diagnostic criteria for pneumonia. Regulatory comments noted problems with missing follow-up diary cards from participants. In children with asthma there was no clear effect on the time to first alleviation of symptoms.
Prophylaxis trials showed that oseltamivir and zanamivir reduced the risk of symptomatic influenza in individuals and households. There was no evidence of an effect on asymptomatic influenza or on non-influenza, influenza-like illness, but trial conduct problems prevent any definitive conclusion.
Oseltamivir use was associated with nausea, vomiting, headaches, renal and psychiatric events; these last three were when it was used to prevent influenza (prophylaxis). Its effect on the heart is unclear: it may reduce cardiac symptoms, but may induce serious heart rhythm problems. In adult treatment trials of zanamivir there was no increased risk of reported adverse events. The evidence on the possible harms associated with the treatment of children with zanamivir was sparse. The lack of good evidence demonstrating an effect on complications agrees with the conservative conclusions on both drugs drawn by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA only allowed claims of effectiveness of both drugs for the prevention and treatment of symptoms of influenza and not for other effects (including the interruption of person-to-person spread of the influenza virus or prevention of pneumonia). The FDA described the overall performance of both drugs as 'modest'. These findings all suggest that the low immune response with low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is induced by the action of oseltamivir carboxylate, may reduce the symptoms of influenza unrelated to an inhibition of influenza virus replication. The potential hypothermic or antipyretic effect of oseltamivir as a central nervous system depressant may also contribute to the apparent reduction of host symptoms. Statements made on the capacity of oseltamivir to interrupt viral transmission and reduce complications are not supported by any data we have been able to access.
The mechanism of action proposed by the producers (influenza virus-specific) does not fit the clinical evidence which suggests a multi-system and central action.
The current report presents the update version of a systematic review previously published in 2012, and is based on 75 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published over a long period since the 1950s and including more than 9000 participants. The effects of all antipsychotic drugs are here compared to those of placebo - namely drug discontinuation - for maintenance treatment, that is prevention of relapses. The aim is to explore the benefits and risks of each of the two options.
The results of this review show very consistently that antipsychotic drugs effectively reduce relapses and need for hospitalisation. Indeed, in case of treatment discontinuation, the risk of relapse at one year is almost three times higher. Antipsychotic drugs appear to have a positive effect on the ability to engage in activities and relationships, and on the possibility to fulfil remission from symptoms, although less evidence is available in this regard. Though based again on a lower number of reports, people continuing their treatment tend to experience higher satisfaction with their life, which confirms the negative consequences on well-being of being at higher risk for recurrence. Conversely, antipsychotic drugs are, as a group, associated with a number of side effects such as movement disorders, weight gain and sedation. However, this review allows more understanding of the fact that stopping treatment is far more harmful than thoughtfully maintaining it.
Unfortunately, studies included in this review do generally last up to one year, and this makes difficult to clarify the longer-term effect of these drugs. It is however true that the longer the study the more likely that other factors - e.g. environmental – may accumulate and complicate the interpretation of results. Most of all, this review supports the advantages of antipsychotic drugs among many different types of participants. The best strategy would be therefore to continue treatment with antipsychotics, eventually discussing and adapting it if any adverse effect occurs.
This review aimed to find out if there were important differences between different clot-dissolving drugs. It also aimed to find out if there were differences in effect when giving the same drug in different doses or by different routes (into an artery or a vein). The review, which included 20 studies involving 2527 participants, showed that there was some evidence that lower doses of thrombolytic agents led to serious bleeding in the brain less often. However, it was not clear if the benefit from lower doses was as big as with higher doses. There was no evidence to show that one thrombolytic agent was clearly better than another, or that intra-arterial treatment was better than intravenous treatment. Therefore, more larger randomised controlled trials are required to answer questions about which drug, or dose or route of administration is best for thrombolysis. At present, rt-PA as currently licensed in many countries, should be regarded as best practice.
We investigated the effectiveness in relieving pain as well as the potential side effects and risks of the ESPB compared to no block, placebo block (patients received saline injection instead of active drugs) and other regional anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia. We included 64 studies that randomly assigned patients to one of the treatment groups (randomised controlled trials) with 3973 patients in total. In these studies all patients received standard opioid care as well as the different regional anaesthesia according to their group allocation. Postoperative pain at rest 24 hours after surgery did not show a clinically relevant difference, with no additional benefit on postoperative pain intensity.
Block-related adverse events were very rare, and we did not observe a significant difference between groups.
Oral opioid consumption as well as opioid-related side effects (such as nausea and itching) were decreased in the groups of patients receiving ESPB treatment. We rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes using the GRADE score (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). The certainty of evidence was graded mostly low, ranging from moderate to very low. This was in part due to many small studies with very diverse outcomes. The current evidence suggests that ESPB probably does not improve postoperative pain intensity one day after surgery beyond standard pain-reducing medications. However, ESPB may not have a high risk of serious block-related adverse events. Furthermore, ESPB may help with reducing the need for opioid medication and thereby reducing opioid-related side effects. Further research is needed to better define the role of ESPB in postoperative pain treatment. The evidence is up-to-date to 4 January 2021.
The review found that people lying on ordinary foam mattresses are more likely to get pressure ulcers than those lying on a higher-specification foam mattress. In addition the review also found that people who used sheepskin overlays on their mattress developed fewer pressure ulcers. While alternating-pressure mattresses may be more cost effective than alternating-pressure overlays, the evidence base regarding the merits of higher-specification constant low-pressure and alternating-pressure support surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers is unclear. Rigorous research comparing different support surfaces is needed.
We performed a thorough search for studies that reported the accuracy of EUS or MRCP in the diagnosis of CBD stones. We included a total of 18 studies involving 2532 participants. Eleven studies evaluated EUS alone, five studies evaluated MRCP alone, and two studies evaluated both tests. A total of 1537 participants were included in the 13 studies that evaluated EUS and 995 participants were included in the seven studies that evaluated MRCP. Most studies included patients who were suspected of having CBD stones based on abnormal blood tests, abnormal ultrasound, or symptoms such as jaundice or pancreatitis, or a combination of the above. The proportion of participants who had undergone previous gallbladder removal varied across studies. Based on an average sensitivity of 95% for EUS, on average 95 out of 100 people with CBD stones will be detected while the remaining 5 people will be missed and will not receive appropriate treatment. The average number of people with CBD stones detected using EUS may vary between 91 and 97 out of 100 people. The average specificity of 97% for EUS means that on average 97 out of 100 people without CBD stones will be identified as not having CBD stones; 3 out of 100 would be false positives and would not receive appropriate treatment. The average number of false positives could vary between 1 and 6 out of 100 people. For MRCP, an average sensitivity of 93% means that on average 93 out of 100 people with CBD stones will be detected while the remaining 7 people will be missed and will not receive appropriate treatment. The average number of people with CBD stones detected using MRCP may vary between 87 and 96 out of 100 people. With an average specificity of 96% for MRCP, 96 out of 100 people without CBD stones will be identified as not having CBD stones; 4 out of 100 would be false positives and would not receive appropriate treatment. The average number of false positives could vary between 2 and 10 out of 100 people. This means that some people with CBD stones can be missed by EUS and MRCP. Although most people with a negative EUS or MRCP do not need to undergo further invasive tests, in the presence of persistent symptoms further testing with MRCP if the patient had undergone EUS or EUS if the patient had undergone MRCP, ERCP, or IOC may be indicated. There is little to choose between EUS and MRCP in terms of diagnostic accuracy. All the studies were of low methodological quality, which may undermine the validity of our findings. Further studies of high methodological quality are necessary.
We wanted to find out if two types of ICIs (anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1)) are effective and safe in adults with GBM.
We need to distinguish people with GBM who will respond to a particular type of treatment from those that will not. The identification of markers that predict response to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 will help to determine who will benefit the most from this treatment. We searched for studies that looked at the effects of ICIs (such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab) in adults with GBM. We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found seven studies dating from 2019 to 2023. The studies looked at anti-PD-1 treatment in a total of 1953 people with newly diagnosed (3 studies) and recurrent (4 studies) GBM. Each trial looked at a different comparison, preventing the combining of data. The studies looked at the following seven comparisons.
• Nivolumab versus bevacizumab
• Nivolumab plus high-dose bevacizumab versus nivolumab plus low-dose bevacizumab
• Pembrolizumab plus bevacizumab versus pembrolizumab
• Pembrolizumab used before and after surgery to remove the tumour versus pembrolizumab used only after surgery
• Nivolumab plus radiotherapy versus temozolomide plus radiotherapy
• Nivolumab plus temozolomide plus radiotherapy versus temozolomide plus radiotherapy
• Nivolumab plus temozolomide versus temozolomide in older people
Results from six trials showed no benefit for overall survival. One trial suggested that pembrolizumab used before and after surgery to remove the tumour may improve overall survival when compared with pembrolizumab used only after surgery, but the evidence is very uncertain.
Results from six trials showed no benefit for progression-free survival (the length of time a person is on treatment before the cancer starts to regrow). One trial suggested that pembrolizumab used before and after surgery to remove the tumour may improve progression-free survival when compared with pembrolizumab used only after surgery, but the evidence is very uncertain. We are only very low to moderately confident in the evidence because study methods were sometimes unclear and therefore could have been inadequate, and in six studies, the people evaluating the outcomes knew which treatments participants had received, which could have influenced the results. High-quality studies are needed to increase our confidence in the findings. The evidence is current to 8 March 2024.
The evidence was current to August 2017. We found 38 studies that were conducted between 1993 and 2016 with 3187 participants that made 23 comparisons between different treatments in men with CP/CPPS. The evaluated interventions usually implied the use of devices, medical advice or some form of physical therapy. In many cases, these therapies were given to men in an outpatient setting. Most studies did not specify their funding sources; three studies reported funding from device makers. Acupuncture: we found that acupuncture (an alternative medicine where thin needles are inserted into the skin at specific points) probably causes a significant decrease in symptoms of prostatitis and may not associated with side effects when compared with pretend acupuncture, however, it may not reduce sexual problems. It probably decreases symptoms when compared with standard medical therapy. We found no information on its effect on quality of life, depression or anxiety.
Lifestyle modifications: we are uncertain whether the recommendation of lifestyle modifications reduces symptoms when compared to the continuation of the same lifestyle. We had no information regarding side effects, sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety.
Physical activity: we found that a physical activity programme may reduce symptoms (small effect) when compared with a non-specific activity used as a control, however it may not reduce anxiety or depression. We have no information regarding side effects, sexual problems or quality of life.
Prostatic massage: we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases symptoms when compared with no massage. We found no information regarding side effects, sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety.
Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: we found that extracorporeal shockwave therapy (where shock waves are passed through the skin to the prostate) causes a significant decrease in symptoms compared to a simulated procedure. These results may not be lasting after more continued treatment. This treatment may not be associated with side effects. We have no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety.
Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy: we found that transrectal thermotherapy (which applies heat to the prostate and pelvic muscle area) alone or in combination with medical therapy may cause a small decrease in symptoms compared to medical therapy alone. One of the included studies reported that participants may experience transient side effects. We have no information regarding sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety.
There is uncertainty about the effects of other interventions. The quality of the evidence was low in most cases, meaning that there is much uncertainty surrounding the results. The included studies were not well designed, had a small sample size and had a short follow-up time (usually 12 weeks).
To date, four research trials have been published in full; they included different groups of patients who had different doses of radiotherapy, and different outcomes were measured. None of the trials showed that patients who had received prophylactic radiotherapy to the brain lived longer than those who had not, although fewer of them developed brain metastases. A fifth trial (RTOG 0214) has not yet been published in full and is discussed in the results section.
Many clinicians prescribe oestrogen therapy (a type of hormonal therapy) to treat pelvic organ prolapse, sometimes in combination with other treatments such as a pessary (a device inserted into the vagina to provide support) or surgery. However, the benefits of this approach are unclear. We wanted to find out whether using oestrogen therapy, either alone or together with other treatments, could improve the symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse in women after their menopause. We searched for studies that investigated the effects of oestrogen therapy, either alone or in combination with other treatments such as pessaries or surgery, on postmenopausal women. We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the results based on aspects such as methods and number of participants. We found 14 studies involving a total of 1002 women. Ten studies recruited women with different severities of pelvic organ prolapse. There were differences across studies in terms of the location of pelvic organ prolapse, the number of children the women had had, whether the women had had a hysterectomy, and the type of oestrogen therapy being investigated. Although we identified 14 eligible studies, no studies addressed our main comparisons of interest (oestrogen therapy alone compared with no treatment, compared with pelvic floor muscle exercises, compared with surgery, or compared with devices such as vaginal pessaries). Four studies evaluated oestrogen therapy alongside vaginal pessaries compared with vaginal pessaries alone, and 10 studies evaluated oestrogen therapy alongside surgery compared with surgery alone. The evidence is very uncertain because of concerns about the studies' methods. The women were often aware of the treatments they were receiving, which may have affected the results. Additionally, many studies included few women. The evidence is up to date to 20 June 2022.
This is an update of the review published in 2019. We examined the evidence from four randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of rPMS involving a total of 139 participants. Two studies compared rPMS against 'sham' stimulation (a very weak stimulation or a sound only). Two studies compared rPMS plus rehabilitation versus sham plus rehabilitation. We found little evidence for the use of rPMS to improve activities of daily living, muscle strength, upper limb function, and spasticity (unusual stiffness of muscles) in people after stroke. The current result is unchanged from the review published in 2019. Although one trial reported that rPMS reduced spasticity of the upper limb, the effect was small and remains unclear. We classified the quality of the evidence as low for improving activities of daily living, mainly because one study had a small sample size. It remains unclear whether rPMS is useful in improving activities of daily living and functional ability in people after stroke. More trials involving larger numbers of participants are needed to determine the effects of rPMS.
The researchers aimed to find out whether the use of gloves, a gown or a mask by any person in the hospital (for example, a doctor) getting close to a patient found to have MRSA prevents the transmission of MRSA from this patient to other people in the hospital.
The researchers made a wide search of the medical literature, up to June 2015, but did not find any rigorous studies that addressed this topic.
At present there is no scientific evidence that the wearing of gloves, a gown, or a mask by people getting close to patients with MRSA reduces the transmission of MRSA to other people in the hospital. However, this should not be interpreted as demonstrating that gloves, gowns or masks are not effective; it means that the research that would be required to measure an effect - if there is one - has not been done yet.
We included 128 trials with 8754 participants of both sexes aged between 33 and 76 years in the review and 94 trials with 5846 participants in the analysis. Three trials reported that their trial was officially registered. Trials included in the review were funded as follows: charity (n = 19), departmental resources (n = 8), governmental sources (n = 15) and industry (in part or in total) (n = 15). The source of funding was not specified for the other trials. We found that an epidural containing a local anaesthetic reduces the time required for return of gut function compared with an opioid-based regimen (equivalent to 17 hours). An epidural providing a local anaesthetic and an opioid also reduce pain (equivalent to a reduction of 2.5 on a scale from 0 to 10 for pain on movement at 24 hours after surgery) and time spent in hospital for open surgery (equivalent to one day). We found no evidence that an epidural with a local anaesthetic would affect the incidence of vomiting or poor healing of the gut. We rated the quality of the evidence as high for return of gastrointestinal function, moderate for pain treatment, low for no effect on vomiting or healing of the gut and very low for reduced time spent in the hospital after open surgery.
We looked for randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of these devices in people with cystic fibrosis. The review found no trials to include. Reports of the use of TIVADs in people with cystic fibrosis suggest that they are safe and effective. They also suggest that certain interventions might reduce the risk of complications; however, these issues have not been examined by randomised controlled trials. We think a multicentre randomised controlled trial is needed to assess the efficacy and possible adverse effects of TIVADs in cystic fibrosis.
A systematic review of the data from randomised controlled trials provides no evidence that routine thyroid hormone therapy is effective in preventing problems in preterm babies or improves their developmental outcomes. Thyroid hormones are needed for the normal growth and maturity of the central nervous system, as well as the heart and lungs. Children born without sufficient thyroid hormones can develop serious mental retardation. It is believed that low levels of thyroid hormones in the first few weeks after birth (transient hyperthyroxinaemia) in preterm babies born before 34 weeks may contribute to this abnormal development. The review of trials found no evidence that using thyroid hormones routinely in preterm babies is effective in reducing the risk of problems caused by transiently low levels of thyroid hormones.
This review found that a single intranasal dose was effective in relieving migraine headache pain and associated symptoms of nausea, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound. Pain was reduced from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in approximately 2 in 10 people (24%) taking sumatriptan 10 mg, compared with about 1 in 10 (10%) taking placebo. Pain was reduced from moderate or severe to no worse than mild pain by two hours in 5 in 10 people (50%) taking sumatriptan 10 mg, compared with approximately 3 in 10 (32%) taking placebo. In addition to relieving headache pain, sumatriptan also relieved symptoms of nausea and sensitivity to light and sound by two hours in about half of those who took it, compared with about one-third of those who took placebo. The 20 mg dose had greater efficacy, but may be associated with more adverse events, most of which were of short duration and mild or moderate in severity.
 We wanted to find out if a restrictive transfusion strategy would increase survival at 31 to 100 days compared to a liberal strategy. We also wanted to find out if a restrictive strategy would improve quality of life, any bleeding, clinically significant bleeding, serious infections, length of hospital admission and hospital readmission rates compared to a liberal strategy.  We searched for randomised controlled trials and prospective non-randomised studies in MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1982), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library2023, Issue 2), and eight other databases (including three trial registries) that evaluated a restrictive compared with a liberal RBC transfusion strategy in children or adults with blood cancers receiving intensive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, with or without undergoing stem cell transplant. We compared and summarised the results and evaluated the study characteristics and methodology to rate our confidence in the collective evidence.  Nine studies met our inclusion criteria; seven were completed and two were still ongoing. The completed studies were conducted between 1997 and 2022 and included 540 participants. One RCT included children receiving a stem cell transplant, and it was stopped early due to safety concerns (six children). The other five RCTs only included adults, 239 adults with acute leukaemia receiving chemotherapy, and 315 with blood cancer receiving a stem cell transplant. The Hb threshold of both the restrictive (70 to 80 g/L) and liberal (80 to 120 g/L) strategies varied across the studies. The sources of funding were reported in all seven studies. One study was sponsored by industry.  The included studies were at considerable risk of bias; the estimates of how the different strategies impacted the outcomes, particularly mortality, had a wide range of possible benefit or harm with too few people to be certain, and a large amount of the evidence was specifically for people with acute leukaemia and blood cancers treated with stem cell transplantation. Most studies experienced a significant number of deviations from the protocols which could have the potential to impact many outcomes due to the rationale for deviations not being well documented. Studies included in the review almost exclusively involved adult participants with only one study included which enroled six paediatric participants.  This review updates the previous review. The evidence is up-to-date until 21 March 2023.
We wanted to find out whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were better than placebo (a pretend treatment) at improving overall self-rated premenstrual symptoms in women with premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder and to explore the occurrence of unwanted effects related to the treatment. We searched for studies that compared selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with placebo amongst women diagnosed with premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and population sizes. We identified 34 studies involving 4563 women diagnosed with severe premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The studies were published between 1991 and 2020, and were mostly set in Western countries; 19 were conducted in the USA. Most women were aged 18 to 49 years. At least 23 studies (68%) were funded by pharmaceutical companies.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were probably effective in reducing the overall premenstrual symptoms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were usually taken either in the two weeks leading up to the start of the menstrual period (the luteal phase) or every day (continuously). Both regimens appeared effective, although continuous dosing was probably a more effective treatment.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors probably increased the risk of unwanted effects, with the most common being nausea, a lack of energy and sleepiness. Other studies found that nausea may be transient while other unwanted effects occurred for longer. The evidence suggested that if the risk of nausea was 7% in the placebo group, it was 20% (ranging from 16% to 24%) in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor group. It also suggested that the risk of experiencing decreased energy was 5% in the placebo group compared to 14% (ranging from 10% to 20%) in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor group. The review authors calculated that nausea is likely to occur as an unwanted effect in approximately one out of eight women taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to treat the premenstrual symptoms, and lack of energy is likely to occur as an unwanted effect in approximately one out of every nine women. We are only moderately confident in the evidence because there was poor reporting of methods in the included studies. In addition, more than two-thirds of the included studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, which may mean that the effects look more favourable towards the medicine of the sponsor. This means that results must be interpreted with caution, and further studies are needed to confirm the findings. This review updates a previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023.
The authors of this study reviewed the medical literature to ascertain the best antibiotic combination for the treatment of this condition. Four eligible studies were identified and only two of these studies were found to be suitable for analysis. Both these studies were performed before 1988. The two studies included 62 infants with NEC and compared one antibiotic regimen to another. There was no difference between the two groups. The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend a particular antibiotic regimen for NEC.
This systemic review was done to analyze whether adding cysteine (or related compounds) to intravenous nutrition affects growth and other outcomes in newborn infants. Five trials studied the effects of adding cysteine to intravenous nutrition that did not contain cysteine. Addition of cysteine significantly improved the babies' ability to build body proteins (analyzed in four studies); however, it did not improve growth (analyzed in one study); no other outcomes were available. One large randomized trial studied the effect of adding another chemical, N-acetyl-cysteine, to intravenous nutrition that already contained cysteine. This study showed no benefit and no toxicity of this intervention. We conclude that present data are insufficient to justify routine addition of cysteine to the intravenous nutrition of newborn infants that does not contain cysteine. Available evidence does not support routine addition of N-acetylcysteine to intravenous nutrition of newborn infants containing cysteine.
We found 11 trials (including 4046 people) that compared cisplatin with carboplatin, both combined with another modern drug, called a third-generation drug. The drugs were equally effective at prolonging survival, but the toxicity profile was different. Carboplatin caused a greater decrease in the number of platelets (which control clotting) in the blood. In this Cochrane review, we found that the quality of evidence was high for overall survival, one-year survival rate and response rate but moderate quality evidence for the other outcomes measured.
Twenty–nine randomised trials comprising more than 1600 participants were reviewed to study the effects of continuous infusion antibiotics versus intermittent infusion antibiotics. When mortality, infection recurrence, clinical cure, super-infection after treatment, and safety concerns were considered, no differences between the two dosing strategies were noted.
The authors conclude that because continuous antibiotic infusions provide no benefit over standard intermittent infusions, they cannot recommend continuous antibiotic infusions for widespread use.
We wanted to find out:
- whether there is evidence that any medications work to prevent attacks of vestibular migraine, or reduce the symptoms when an attack occurs;
- whether the treatments might cause any harm. We searched for studies including adults that compared different medications to either no treatment or placebo (dummy) treatment. We used standard methods to assess the certainty of the evidence. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods, the number of participants in them and the consistency of findings across studies. We found three studies, which included a total of 209 people (65% female). These studies looked at two different types of medicines, to assess whether they might help to prevent vestibular migraine attacks, or help to reduce the symptoms when episodes occur.
Beta-blockers
The first study looked at the use of a medicine called metoprolol, a tablet taken once daily. Metoprolol is from a group of medications known as beta-blockers. These are often used to treat high blood pressure, but are also used to try and prevent attacks of headache migraine. It was unclear whether this treatment made any difference to the frequency of vertigo attacks, or whether it was associated with any serious harms.
Calcium channel blockers
Two smaller studies assessed the use of flunarizine, a tablet taken once a day. This is from the family of medications known as calcium channel blockers. Again, these medicines are commonly used to control high blood pressure, but are also used for headache migraine. It was very unclear whether people felt their symptoms had improved when taking this treatment and whether the frequency of their vertigo attacks changed. The studies did not report on serious harms of the treatment, so we do not know if there were any risks associated with taking the medication. We have very little confidence in the evidence because the three studies conducted were small. There were also some problems with the conduct of the studies, which means that the results may be unreliable. These medications are often used for other conditions, where they are known to be associated with some side effects. However, we did not identify enough information in this review to know whether these side effects are a problem when the treatments are used for vestibular migraine. This evidence is up-to-date to September 2022.
The review of studies found that there was a limited amount of evidence to show that the newer extra-fine form of BDP was similar to FP at the same dose. More research should be done in children and in people with more severe asthma to help answer the question of what the relative effects of these two steroids are. Some people may not be particularly good at using certain inhaler types and the findings of the review may only really apply to people who are competent in using metered-dose inhalers (MDIs). Studies should consider introducing spacers where people find these easier to use.
This review evaluated the effects of giving people at high risk for HIV infection drugs to prevent infection (called antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP). We found six randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC) versus placebo; TDF versus placebo, and daily TDF-FTC versus intermittent TDF-FTC. One of the trials had three study arms (TDF, TDF-FTC and placebo arm). The trials were carried out amongst different risk groups, including HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men, people in serodiscordant sexual relationships where one partner is infected and the other is not, and other high risk men and women. The findings suggests that the use of TDF alone or TDF+FTC reduces the risk of becoming infected with HIV. However, further studies are need to evaluate the method of administration (daily versus intermittent dosing), long-term safety and cost effectiveness of PrEP in different risk groups and settings.
This systematic review focused on randomised studies evaluating the antitumour effects of anthracycline therapy. The authors found that at the moment no high quality evidence is available which shows that the use of anthracyclines has an increased antitumour effect in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) as compared to treatment without anthracyclines, but there was some suggestion that this might be the case. Further high quality studies are needed to provide a definitive conclusion. For Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatoblastoma and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) the review authors found only limited data and were unable to draw conclusions. Also, there were no data for other childhood cancers. More high quality research is needed. At the moment there are five ongoing or unpublished randomised studies evaluating the use of anthracyclines in the following types of childhood cancer, hepatoblastoma, ALL (two studies), rhabdomyosarcoma, and Wilms' tumour.
We included 127 studies in the review and sampled 41 of these studies for our analysis. Thirty-two further studies were found after the updated search on 5 July 2022 and are awaiting classification. The sampled studies were from 24 different countries, across all World Health Organization regions. These studies primarily explored the views and experiences of cash transfer recipients with different health conditions, such as infectious diseases, disabilities and long-term illnesses, sexual and reproductive health, and maternal and child health. We had mainly moderate-to-high confidence in our findings. We found that people receiving the cash transfers saw them as necessary. They described the cash as helpful in the short term, and sometimes in the long term. However, people often felt that the amount given was too little to meet their needs. They also felt that the cash alone was not enough to change their behaviour and that they also needed other types of support, such as social or psychological support or training and opportunities for employment. People described how the cash empowered them and made them more independent, especially women and people with disabilities. In some settings, people experienced pressure from family or programme staff on how to use cash. People described how the cash had improved their relationships with their families and the community. However, in communities where some received the cash and others did not, this could also cause tension, suspicion and conflict. Some people also described being stigmatised for receiving cash transfers. While people often experienced barriers to accessing cash, some refused or were hesitant to receive the cash. Some recipients found cash transfer programmes more acceptable when they agreed with programme goals and processes. We searched for studies published before 5 June 2020. The search was rerun in July 2022 and an additional 32 studies are awaiting classification.
Study characteristics Key resultsWe found no studies that involved newborn infants before the 28thday of life. We found two studies with a subpopulation of newborns, but we were not able to extract the data from this subgroup out of the total group studied.Quality of evidence
There is currently no evidence comparing protocolized and non-protocolized weaning in newborn infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.
We analysed 63 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). An RCT is a type of study in which the people being studied are randomly allocated one or other of the different treatments being investigated. This type of study is usually the best way to evaluate whether a treatment is truly effective, i.e. truly helps the patient. A systematic review systematically summarises the available RCTs on a subject.
A total of 6811 women participated in the studies. The studies compared vaginal versus abdominal hysterectomy (12 trials, 1046 women), laparoscopic versus abdominal hysterectomy (28 trials, 3431 women), laparoscopic versus vaginal hysterectomy (22 trials, 2135 women), laparoscopic versus robot-assisted hysterectomy (three trials, 296 women) and laparoscopic versus transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (two trials, 96 women). There were also studies included in which different types of laparoscopic hysterectomies were compared, including single-port versus multi-port (seven trials, 613 women) and total laparoscopic hysterectomy versus laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (three trials, 233 women). The main outcomes were return to normal activities, satisfaction, quality of life and surgical complications. We found that vaginal hysterectomy probably results in a quicker return to normal activities than abdominal hysterectomy. If the return to normal activities after abdominal hysterectomy is assumed to be 42 days, then after vaginal hysterectomy it would be between 24 and 38 days. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups for the other main outcomes. However, non-numerical data may suggest improved quality of life after vaginal hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy.
Laparoscopic hysterectomy also probably results in a quicker return to normal activities than abdominal hysterectomy. Based on our findings, if the return to normal activities after abdominal hysterectomy is assumed to be 37 days, after laparoscopic hysterectomy it would be between 22 and 25 days. However, laparoscopic hysterectomies are likely associated with greater risk of damaging the ureter (tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder). If the rate of ureter injury during abdominal hysterectomy is assumed to be 0%, then during laparoscopic hysterectomy it would be between 0% and 2%. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomy, between laparoscopic and robot-assisted hysterectomy, or between laparoscopic and natural orifice surgery for our main outcomes. Many studies did not include information about patient satisfaction or quality of life.
We conclude that vaginal hysterectomy should be performed whenever possible. Where vaginal hysterectomy is not possible, the laparoscopic approach has advantages over abdominal hysterectomy but greater risk of ureter injury. These pros and cons should be incorporated in the decision-making process with the patient.
The evidence is current to December 2022. We had low or moderate confidence in the evidence for most of the comparisons. The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods and the evidence being based on few cases of the condition/type of event.
We searched the international literature for randomised controlled trials looking at the effects of medically assisted nutrition in adults receiving palliative care. Randomised controlled trials allocate patients to one of two or more treatment groups in a random manner and provide the most accurate information on the best treatment. The search was conducted in April 2013 and March 2014. We found no randomised controlled trials. As a result, it is not possible to define the benefits and harms of this treatment clearly.
We found six small trials of unclear quality answering these two questions. We found data from four trials on 171 children comparing anticholinergics with beta2-agonists. Children on anticholinergics alone were significantly more likely to experience treatment failure than those on beta2-agonists (odds ratio (OR) 2.27; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.75). We also found data from four trials on 173 children comparing children on anticholinergics alone with children on anticholinergics plus beta2-agonists. In this case, treatment failure was more likely in children taking anticholinergics only than if they were combined with beta2-agonists (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.2 to 5.88). We were only able to combine data for treatment failure and hospitalisation.
In summary, we found that inhaled anticholinergics used on their own are less effective than inhaled beta2-agonists used alone or in combination with anticholinergics. Inhaled anticholinergics seem safe, with no significant side effects apparent.
Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 2313 people. These studies varied in terms of how bad exacerbations had to be for people to be included and in terms of what other treatments were provided before IV MgSO4was given, but almost all trials gave participants at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting medications and steroid tablets or injection.
Overall, IV MgSO4 reduced the need for hospital admission compared with placebo (seven fewer per 100 treated; 95% confidence interval two to 13 fewer). Not enough information was available to show whether the reduction in hospital admissions was associated with severity of the asthma exacerbation, or whether it made a difference what other treatments were given. Evidence suggests that IV MgSO4 improved some lung function parameters, but for other measures such as heart rate, variation among study findings reduced our confidence in the results. We did not find a difference between IV MgSO4 and placebo in most other measures (including time spent in the ED, respiratory rate and blood pressure), and adverse events generally were poorly reported. This review showed that IV MgSO4reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with exacerbations of asthma when other first-line medications have not relieved the acute symptoms (i.e. oxygen, inhaled short-acting medications and IV steroids). Evidence for other measures of benefit and safety was limited.
Researchers should clearly define the severity of the asthma condition among people in their studies while carefully recording adverse events.
This plain language summary is current as of May 2014.
We studied several pain management strategies (excluding kangaroo care, sucrose, breastfeeding/breast milk, and music due to existing reviews on these strategies) after acute medical procedures in preterm born newborns, full-term born newborns, and full-term born older infants up to the age of three, to understand how effective these strategies are at reducing pain. We assessed 24 different strategies for reducing young children's pain after medical procedures using care-giving strategies that do not require medication, such as using a pacifier, swaddling a child, and massaging a child. We compared the pain-reducing effects of these strategies to groups receiving no pain management strategies. When possible, we also compared groups receiving one strategy to those receiving multiple strategies to see whether multiple strategies lead to more pain reduction. We looked at whether there was a difference in the impact of the interventions depending on whether the infant had just had the painful procedure (pain reactivity phase), as opposed to calming down from the peak distress (immediate pain regulation phase).
We converted different measures of pain intensity (coded by either trained nurses or research staff) into a standard scale to help readers interpret the findings. The standard scale ranges from 0 to 21, with 0 being no pain and 21 being very severe pain. This updated Cochrane Review included 138 randomised controlled trials (trials in which participants were randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) involving 11,058 participants undergoing a painful acute medical procedure. Non-nutritive sucking, swaddling, facilitated tucking, and structured parent involvement were the four strategies most studied.
In preterm newborns, there was evidence that non-nutritive sucking, facilitated tucking, and swaddling may reduce pain. On the standard scale, preterm newborns receiving non-nutritive sucking may, on average, score two points lower than preterms receiving no strategies both immediately after the painful procedure and when calming down from peak distress. Preterm newborns receiving facilitated tucking may, on average, score 3.5 points lower immediately after a painful procedure and two points lower when calming down from peak distress compared to preterms receiving no pain management strategies. While swaddling does not seem to reduce pain scores immediately after the painful procedure, swaddled preterm newborns may score, on average, four points lower than newborns receiving no strategies when calming down from distress.
In full-term newborns, non-nutritive sucking may reduce pain. On the standard scale, full-term newborns receiving non-nutritive sucking may, on average, score four points lower immediately after a painful procedure and five points lower when calming down from peak distress compared to newborns receiving no pain management strategies.
Structured parent involvement was the strategy most studied in full-term born older infants, but evidence showed that this strategy likely has little to no pain reduction effect in this age group.
Adverse events were very rare across these strategies. Following non-nutritive sucking, one preterm newborn vomited and one full-term newborn had lower oxygen levels. No adverse events occurred following swaddling, facilitated tucking, or structured parent involvement. The results of this review are based on very uncertain evidence. Many studies were too small or there were not enough studies on particular interventions to be certain about the results for our outcomes. There was also inconsistency across studies because the administration of non-pharmacological interventions varied widely across trials in different settings. Many studies also used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. Overall, none of the analyses presented here were based on enough evidence to allow us to draw firm conclusions (i.e. high-certainty studies from at least two independent research groups). This review is based on evidence up until October 2020. The search for studies was updated up to July 2022 and 33 eligible studies are awaiting assessment and will be incorporated in to a future update of this review.
Two randomised controlled trials were included in this review involving a total of 271 women with twin pregnancies at 37 weeks' gestation. One of the two trials (involving 235 women) was of high quality, and the quality of the second trial (involving 36 women) was unclear. There were no differences shown between the group of women who had an elective birth at 37 weeks' gestation and the group of women who waited for labour to start spontaneously for the outcomes: birth by caesarean section, perinatal (fetal or neonatal) death or serious perinatal morbidity, or maternal death or serious maternal morbidity. No other differences between the two groups of women were shown for other pregnancy and birth complications or for complications for the infant.
Elective birth at 37 weeks' gestation compared with ongoing expectant management for women with uncomplicated twin pregnancies does not appear be associated with an increased risk of harms.
We found two studies that compared two different kinds of pain reduction methods (a cervical shot and pain treatment with medications injected through the veins, i.e. intravenous or IV). Similar rates of pain were reported by women whose cervix was injected with lidocaine (a medicine that blocks pain) compared to women whose cervix was injected with salt water (placebo). However, at some points during the procedure, women who had the lidocaine rated their pain lower than women who had the salt water. Similarly, women who had IV pain treatment reported about the same pain overall as women given pain pills. However, the women with IV pain treatment reported less pain as the procedure continued.
The two studies do not give us enough information about which pain treatment was better for sterilization by hysteroscopy.
Overall, we found 10 studies evaluating different non-medication treatments to treat chronic pain in persons with MS. The treatments evaluated included: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, transcranial direct stimulation, transcranial random noise stimulation, reflexology, psychotherapy and hydrotherapy. These studies included 565 participants and used a range of different methods to measure pain and other outcomes. Comparison groups also varied. Results from these studies show a very low level of evidence for the use of any non-medication treatments for chronic pain in persons with MS. We assessed the overall quality of the studies as very low, as many studies included only small numbers of participants and had other methodological issues. More research with good methodological quality and greater number of participants are needed to determine the effectiveness of such treatments.
We found 30 relevant trials. Most trials looked at different treatments that each worked differently. Many trials compared different types of treatments with each other. We decided that trials comparing one treatment against no active treatment were most important because we do not know which, if any, treatments actually work.
The results told us that antioxidant medicines (which scavenge and neutralise unstable particles that are naturally formed during metabolism or by exposure to environmental toxins) taken by mouth may improve mouth opening slightly for up to six months after treatment, but we are not sure that this lasts longer than six months. Antioxidants may also reduce burning sensation in the mouth for more than six months after treatment and we think this might be an important improvement for people with oral submucous fibrosis.
The evidence for other treatments that we looked at was very uncertain.
Only half of the trials reported side effects or other potentially harmful effects of the treatments, so it is difficult to say confidently how safe any of the treatments might be. We are moderately confident that antioxidants help in the treatment of oral submucous fibrosis, but have little confidence in the other evidence because many trials had design limitations. We searched for trials up to 5 September 2022.
In our review we found six studies, with a total of 449 patients, in which one of two interventions were applied. One intervention (four studies, 267 patients) was a CL following a consultation between the patient and the psychiatrist; the other (two studies, 182 patients) was a CL following a joint consultation between patient, psychiatrist and primary care physician. In each case comparison was against care as usual, provided by the primary care physician. The first intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (three studies) and improved physical functioning (three studies). We found evidence for a slight reduction in the severity of the MUPS, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning following the second intervention, although in only one of two studies assessed. There are serious limitations in generalizability of the results to modern healthcare: most trials reported doctor-related outcomes with patient-related outcomes varying in results; the intervention appears to be far more effective for the most serious but rare disorders, and less so in the more common forms of MUPS; five of the six studies were performed in the United States and four studies before 1995. Furthermore the studied populations were small and five of the six studies were of moderate quality.
Our final conclusion is that CLs may be helpful for physicians who treat patients with MUPS (based on the provider-related outcomes). However, until further studies are conducted to find out if the intervention results in improved patient-related outcomes, the overall effectiveness of CLs cannot be demonstrated.
Five small studies, each with 24 to 54 participants, included 177 participants in total with painful diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia. Studies were randomised and double-blind, but all had one or more sources of potential major bias that could lead to overestimation of efficacy. It was not possible to combine information from the different studies, but individually they indicated some benefit from desipramine (usually at a dose between 100 mg and 150 mg daily), compared with placebo, at the expense of increased adverse events. There was not enough information about other comparators to draw any conclusions.
There was too little information, which was of inadequate quality, to be sure that desipramine works as a pain medicine in painful diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia, and no information about other types of neuropathic pain. Other medicines have been shown to be effective as treatments of first choice.
We found, through systematic search, only one study where investigators assessed the usefulness of ketamine for management of severe acute asthma in children. While this single study suggested that there is a lack of evidence for usefulness of ketamine in acute exacerbation of asthma in children, more trials are needed regarding the use of ketamine in acute asthma before more specific recommendations can be made.
We searched for high-quality studies (randomised controlled trials) of dietary changes (salt, caffeine and alcohol restriction or substitution, or both) compared to no restriction in adult patients with Ménière's disease or syndrome. Our search is up to date to March 2018. We did not identify any randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria for the review. There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials about the restriction of salt, caffeine or alcohol intake in patients with Ménière's disease or syndrome. High-quality research in this field is needed if this question is to be answered, in the form of a study that uses rigorous methods (for example, randomisation and blinding, or careful use of patient registries) and carefully recruits only patients that meet accepted Ménière's disease diagnostic criteria. It will be important to address the question of any possible harms or unwanted effects of dietary changes.
In experimental studies many drugs have shown some promise in decreasing liver damage caused by the occluded blood supply. The relative benefits of pharmacological agents compared with one another is unknown in the setting of liver damage caused by occlusion of the blood supply to the liver during surgery. We identified a total of five randomised trials evaluating nine different pharmacological interventions (amrinone, prostaglandin E1, pentoxifylline, dopexamine, dopamine, ulinastatin, gantaile, sevoflurane, and propofol). All trials had risk of bias ('systematic error') and risk of play of chance ('random errors'). There was no significant difference between the groups in mortality, liver failure, or postoperative complications. The ulinastatin group had significantly lower postoperative enzyme markers of liver injury compared with the gantaile group. None of the remaining pharmacological agents showed any significant difference in any of the remaining outcomes. However, there is a high risk of type I (erroneously concluding that an intervention is beneficial when it is actually not beneficial) and type II errors (erroneously concluding that an intervention is not beneficial when it is actually beneficial) because of the few trials included, the small sample size in each trial, and the risk of bias. Ulinastatin may have a protective effect relative to gantaile against liver injury sustained during elective liver surgery involving blood supply occlusion. The absolute benefit of ulinastatin in this setting remains unknown. None of the pharmacological agents can be recommended for routine clinical practice. Considering that none of the agents have been proven to be useful to decrease ischaemia reperfusion injury, such trials should include a group of patients who do not receive any active intervention whenever possible to determine their absolute effect on ischaemia reperfusion injury in liver resections.
This evidence is current to 15 March 2019. The men studied were ages 64 years and over and had prostate cancer limited to the pelvis. We studied the use of fewer, but larger doses of radiation to treat 8278 men with prostate cancer. We found 10 studies.
We found that using hypofractionation may result in similar risk of dying from prostate cancer (low-certainty evidence) but are uncertain how it affects late bowel side effects (very low-certainty evidence). It probably results in similar rates of late bladder side effects (moderate-certainty evidence).
Using hypofractionation results in similar overall survival (high-certainty evidence) and may be similar for metastasis-free survival (low-certainty evidence). Acute bladder side effects may be similar (moderate-certainty evidence).
We looked at randomised controlled trials that compared ambulatory oxygen versus a placebo (normal air). We found four studies on 331 people with a mean age of 71 years. Two of the included studies were from Australia, one from New Zealand and one from Canada. The method of oxygen delivery and the dose of oxygen varied, although equipment in all instances consisted of light-weight or portable cylinders with flow ranging from 3 L/min to 6 L/min. Final follow-up was reported as 12 weeks for three studies and two weeks for the Nonoyama study. We found that ambulatory oxygen therapy reduced breathlessness and decreased the number of patients who felt tired. However, the distance that people could walk in five to six minutes and survival (death rate) did not change. The overall quality of evidence from the studies in this review was moderate. The way the studies were conducted (methods) was not fully reported in all cases. Most studies were lacking the pre-published study plan (protocol). From this review, it is not possible to know whether ambulatory oxygen therapy should be provided during exercise or for day-to-day activities for patients with COPD who are not severely hypoxaemic at rest.
This Cochrane plain language summary is up-to-date as of November 2012.
In total, 2431 participants were enrolled in 29 trials. The study sample sizes ranged from 20 to 323 participants, and most of them were middle-aged people recruited from primary or tertiary care. The duration of the treatment programmes ranged from 20 days to 12 weeks, and the number of treatment sessions ranged from one to five sessions per week. Sixteen trials compared MCE with other types of exercises, seven trials compared MCE with minimal intervention, five trials compared MCE with manual therapy, three trials compared MCE with a combination of exercise and electrophysical agents, and one trial compared MCE with telerehabilitation based on home exercises. MCE probably provides better improvements in pain, function and global impression of recovery than minimal intervention at all follow-up periods. MCE may provide slightly better improvements than exercise and electrophysical agents for pain, disability, global impression of recovery and the physical component of quality of life in the short and intermediate term. There is probably little or no difference between MCE and manual therapy for all outcomes and follow-up periods. Little or no difference is observed between MCE and other forms of exercise. Given the minimal evidence that MCE is superior to other forms of exercise, the choice of exercise for chronic LBP should probably depend on patient or therapist preferences, therapist training, costs and safety.
The pooled analysis of the four trials comparing OSR with EVAR showed that the death rates within 30 days of operation or during admission for surgery were significantly lower in individuals undergoing EVAR than in those undergoing OSR (1.4% versus 4.2%). However, there was no difference in death rates between the groups up to four years after the operation (intermediate follow up) or beyond four years (long-term follow up). Participants undergoing EVAR had a significantly higher incidence of a need for an additional intervention to deal with any complications of the procedure undertaken compared with those receiving OSR. Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between the two procedures. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of lung complications in the OSR group than in the EVAR group. The results of the one RCT comparing EVAR with no intervention in individuals considered unfit for OSR showed no difference in overall death rates and complication rates between the groups.
This review included four RCTs involving 438 patients that investigated the benefits and harms of routine abdominal drainage post-gastrectomy for gastric cancer. There was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in deaths, post-operative complications, and initiation of a soft diet. The results showed that drains increased harms by prolonging operation time and post-operative hospital stay, and led to drain-related complications without providing any additional benefit for patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy. There was no convincing evidence to support the routine use of drains after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The overall quality of the evidence according to the GRADE approach was 'very low' for deaths and re-operations, and 'low' for post-operative complications, operation time, and post-operative length of stay. This review included only four RCTs, and not all of the included studies reported all outcomes that we were assessing. Therefore, the quality was mainly limited by insufficient data.
Five trials including 292 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review. After exclusion of 23 participants due to various reasons, 269 participants (with symptomatic chronic pancreatitis involving the head of pancreas and undergoing surgery) received duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (DPPHR) (head of pancreas is removed without removing the duodenum) (135 participants) or pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) (head of pancreas is removed along with the duodenum encircling it) (134 participants) in these trials. The trials did not report anaesthetic risk (likelihood of complications due to anaesthesia) of the participants. All the trials were single-centre (occurred in only one clinical or medical centre). The participants were observed (followed up) for various periods of time ranging from one to 15 years. All the trials were at high risk of bias. The differences in short-term (up to 90 days after surgery) or long-term (maximal follow-up) mortality, medium-term (three months to five years) or long-term (more than five years) quality of life, percentage and number of people with side effects, percentage of people employed (maximal follow-up), percentage of people who developed diabetes (maximum follow-up), and percentage of people with pancreatic digestive enzyme deficiency (maximum follow-up) were imprecise. The length of hospital stay appeared to be lower with DPPHR compared to PD and ranged between a reduction of one and five days in the trials. None of the trials reported short-term quality of life (four weeks to three months), clinically significant pancreatic fistulas (abnormal drainage of pancreatic juice internally or externally), serious side effects, time to return to normal activity, time to return to work, and pain scores using a visual analogue scale (a measurement tool to compare subjective measures such as pain that cannot be directly measured; pain levels between 0 and 10 or 0 and 100). The quality of evidence was low or very low. As a result, further studies are required on this topic. Such studies should report the severity of postoperative complications and their impact on patient recovery and should include all the trial participants in the results. In addition to the short-term benefits and harms such as mortality, surgery-related complications, quality of life, length of hospital stay, return to normal activity, and return to work, future trials should consider linkage of trial participants to health databases, social databases, and mortality registers to obtain the long-term benefits and harms of the different treatments.
We found 24 studies, which contained information about five different rapid tests. A total of 4271 people participated in these studies. One of the rapid tests (called the rK39 immunochromatographic test) gave correct, positive results in 92% of the people with visceral leishmaniasis and it gave correct, negative results in 92% of the people who did not have the disease. This test worked better in India and Nepal than in east Africa. In India and Nepal, it gave correct, positive results in 97% of the people with the disease. In east Africa, it gave correct, positive results in only 85% of the people with the disease.
A second rapid test (called latex agglutination test) gave correct, positive results in 64% of the people with the disease and it gave correct, negative results in 93% of the people without the disease. For the other rapid tests evaluated, there are too few studies to know how accurate they are.
We searched medical databases for randomised (where two groups of children were randomly assigned to treatment or no treatment) clinical trials of children treated for blunt trauma to the pancreas by an operation or no operation. The children were aged 17 years or younger. The search was current to June 2013. We found no randomised clinical trials investigating operative treatment compared with non-operative treatment of severe pancreatic injury in children, hence we have no firm evidence to support either operative treatment or non-operative treatment of severe pancreatic lesions in children. Although difficult because of the rarity and the acute nature of these lesions, we recommend that multicentre randomised clinical trials of good quality are conducted.
The review looked at trials that compared preterm babies who received steroids by inhalation to those who received steroids systemically (through a vein or orally) while they were receiving mechanical ventilation. We included two trials that involved 294 infants. One study included 278 infants and the other study included 16 infants. No new studies were included for the 2017 update.
Both studies received grant support and the industry provided aero chambers and metered dose inhalers of budesonide and placebo for the larger study. No conflict of interest was identified. There was no evidence that inhaling steroids compared to systemic steroids prevented the primary outcome of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The number of days the baby needed mechanical ventilation support or additional oxygen were increased in infants who received inhaled steroids versus infants who received systemic steroids. These outcomes were reported in both the trials. The rate of patent ductus arteriosus (failure for the ductus arteriosus, an arterial shunt in fetal life, to close after birth) was increased in the group receiving inhaled steroids. There was a lower incidence of high blood sugars in the inhaled steroid group compared with the systemic steroid group. These secondary outcomes were reported in only one trial (the larger trial). In a sub-sample of 52 children at age 7 years there were no differences in long-term follow-up outcomes between the inhaled and the systemic steroid groups. in an even smaller sample of 48 infants the outcome of 'ever diagnosed as asthmatic by seven years of age' was significantly lower in the inhaled steroid group compared with the systemic steroid group. According to GRADE the quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
This methodology review identified five studies which investigated the effect of including trials found in the grey literature in systematic reviews of health care interventions. They showed that trials found in the published literature tend to be larger and show larger effects of a health care intervention than those trials found in the grey literature. There was limited evidence to show whether grey trials are of poorer methodological quality than published trials. This means that those carrying out systematic reviews need to search for trials in both the published and grey literature in order to help minimise the effects of publication bias in their review.
This Cochrane review investigated whether interventions for healthcare professionals are effective for improving at their reporting of adverse drug events. Adverse drug events include any adverse drug reaction (ADR) and any medication error (ME). We looked at evidence from a range of different types of studies to find out if interventions aimed at healthcare professionals could increase the number of adverse drug event reports they make. We compared the total number of adverse drug event reports (which included both ADR and ME reports) submitted by healthcare professionals. We were also interested in the number of false adverse drug event reports they made. As well as the total number of reports, we looked separately at the number of reports submitted for adverse drug events that were categorised as serious, high-causality (i.e. very likely to be caused by the drug), unexpected (i.e. previously unknown) or related to recent drugs (i.e. only used in the last five years). This review included 15 studies (62,389 participants) that compared the effect of various interventions aimed at healthcare professionals to increase the number of adverse drug event reports they make. All the studies were carried out in high-income countries. None of the studies looked at whether these interventions led to more false adverse drug event reports.
Compared to usual practice (spontaneous reporting and some training from regional units that monitor the safety of medicines), an education session about why and how to report adverse events, plus reminder of the session content and provision of an ADR report form, may increase the number of ADR reports made by healthcare professionals.
Compared to usual practice (spontaneous reporting), using a standardised discharge form with additional ADR items about when the ADR occurred and how it developed may also slightly improve the number of ADR reports made. The standardised form tested was based on the ‘Diagnosis Related Groups’ system for recording patient diagnoses and the medical and surgical procedures patients receive during their hospital stay.
We are very uncertain about the effectiveness of other interventions that were tested in the studies, including:
- sending informational letters or emails to GPs and nurses;
- interventions with multiple aspects, including financial and non-financial incentives, fines, education and reminder cards;
- implementing government regulations together with financial incentives;
- including ADR report forms in quarterly bulletins and prescription pads;
- providing a hyperlink to the reporting form in hospitals' electronic patient records;
- improving the reporting method by re-engineering the web-based electronic error reporting system;
- the presence of a clinical pharmacist in hospital who actively identifies adverse drug events and encourages the identification and reporting of adverse drug events. The evidence in this review is based on searches up to October 2022.
This review included 15 trials, of a moderate risk of bias, that involved over 4600 women and their babies. In this review, TRH, given with corticosteroids to women at risk of early birth, was not shown to further reduce the breathing difficulties for the babies. Babies born to mothers who had received TRH with corticosteroids, were more likely to require support for breathing than babies born to mothers who received only corticosteroids. Women receiving TRH were more likely to experience adverse side effects, such as nausea, vomiting and flushing than women who only received corticosteroids.
Therefore, based on the current available evidence, TRH is not recommended to be given to women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory disease.
We did not find any trials which have been completed on this topic with available results. The only trial which met our criteria for inclusion had been terminated due to encountering difficulties with recruiting participants. Therefore we cannot be sure whether controlling blood glucose intensively when people have diabetic foot ulcers is beneficial or harmful. The lack of evidence however should not deter efforts to achieve optimal glycaemic control in people with diabetic foot ulcers to encourage healing as is current practice. We believe there are currently two trials underway which may provide some evidence on this topic once completed.
This Plain Language Summary is up to date as of 7 December 2015.
This review of trials found that there was insufficient evidence that inhaling corticosteroids as well as taking the drugs orally is better than oral use alone, after emergency department treatment for an asthma attack. There is also insufficient evidence that taking ICS alone is as good as taking them orally, although there is some evidence to support using ICS alone for mild asthma attacks after emergency department discharge. More research is needed.
We assessed the effect of cutting down the amount of saturated fat we eat for at least two years on health outcomes including dying, heart disease and stroke. We only looked at studies of adults (18 years or older). They included men and women with and without cardiovascular disease. We did not include studies of acutely ill people or pregnant or breastfeeding women. We found 15 studies with over 56,000 participants. The evidence is current to October 2019. The review found that cutting down on saturated fat led to a 17% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease (including heart disease and strokes), but had little effect on the risk of dying. The review found that health benefits arose from replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fat or starchy foods. The greater the decrease in saturated fat, and the more serum total cholesterol is reduced, the greater the protection from cardiovascular events. People who are currently healthy appear to benefit as much as those at increased risk of heart disease or stroke (people with high blood pressure, high serum cholesterol or diabetes, for example), and people who have already had heart disease or stroke. There was no difference in effect between men and women.
This means that, if 56 people without cardiovascular disease, or 53 people who already have cardiovascular disease, reduce their saturated fat for around 4 years, then one person will avoid a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) they would otherwise have experienced. There is a large body of evidence assessing effects of reducing saturated fat for at least two years. These studies provide moderate-quality evidence that reducing saturated fat reduces our risk of cardiovascular disease.
This is an updated version of a review that was first published in 2009. Since undertaking this review, we have searched the literature three times (2008, 2012 and 2016), and have identified seven completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and four ongoing trials. The completed trials compared three different treatment methotrexate regimens with two different actinomycin D regimens that differed by drug dose and dosing frequency. We assessed these trials as being at low to moderate risk of bias. We extracted and pooled data where possible, grouping the studies according to the treatments compared in the studies.
What did we find?
Overall, and for each treatment regimen compared, the review evidence shows that actinomycin D is probably more likely to achieve a cure in the first instance than methotrexate, and less likely to fail. Side-effects were reported to be relatively mild with either treatment and the most commonly experienced side-effects among women in the studies were nausea, fatigue and anaemia. However, the evidence on side-effects and serious adverse events is uncertain. Low-certainty evidence suggests that severe adverse events may be more common with actinomycin D, particularly with the five-day regimen.
Conclusions
Actinomycin D is probably a more effective treatment than methotrexate but the evidence on side-effects and severe adverse effects is uncertain and more evidence is needed. More evidence is also needed on the effects of these treatments on future fertility. Four RCTs comparing methotrexate and actinomycin D regimen are currently underway and these will make an important contribution to this field.
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing different blood thinners in people with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of clots in the limbs or in the lungs. We included trials of adults and children with either solid tumours or blood cancer, irrespective of the type of cancer treatment. The trials looked at death, recurrent blood clots, and bleeding. The evidence is current to August 2021. We identified 15 studies in total. Data from five studies suggested that the LMWH may reduce death at three months compared to UFH, and may reduce recurrent clots slightly. We found no data to compare the effect of these two medications on bleeding outcomes. Also, we found that fondaparinux may increase death at three months, may result in little to no difference in recurrent clots and major bleeding, and probably increases minor bleeding. Also, the current evidence found that dalteparin, a type of LMWH, may reduce death slightly, may reduce recurrent clots, may increase major bleeding slightly, and may reduce minor bleeding slightly. We judged the certainty of evidence for low molecular weight heparin versus unfractionated heparin to be low for all assessed outcomes; for fondaparinux versus heparin to be low certainty, except for minor bleeding which was moderate certainty; and for tinzaparin versus dalteparin, to be low certainty.
We identified 21 randomized controlled trials (3042 infants) for inclusion in this review by searching medical databases in June 2016. Compared with conventional neonatal care, KMC was found to reduce mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks' postmenstrual age and at latest follow-up, severe infection/sepsis, nosocomial infection/sepsis, hypothermia, severe illness, and lower respiratory tract disease. Moreover, KMC increased weight, length, and head circumference gain, breastfeeding at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks' postmenstrual age and at one to three months' follow-up, mother satisfaction with method of infant care, some measures of maternal-infant attachment, and home environment. Researchers noted no differences in neurodevelopmental and neurosensory outcomes at 12 months' corrected age. Most critical and important outcomes had moderate-quality evidence. KMC is an effective and safe alternative to conventional neonatal care for LBW infants, mainly in resource-limited countries.
We identified 27 relevant studies that had included 10,565 participants. The studies varied in design; and whether treatments were delivered according to standardized procedures (i.e. manualized); and whether AA/TSF was compared to a treatment that had a different theoretical basis (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)), or to a different type of TSF (i.e. one that varied in style or intensity from the AA TSF). The Included studies were funded through one or more grants from the United States National Institutes of Health (18 studies), the USA Department of Veterans Affairs (8 studies), and other organizations (e.g. private foundations or academic institutions; 8 studies). Two studies did not report their source of funding. Manualized AA/TSF interventions usually produced higher rates of continuous abstinence than the other established treatments investigated. Non-manualized AA/TSF performed as well as other established treatments.
AA/TSF may be superior to other treatments for increasing the percentage of days of abstinence, particularly in the longer-term. AA/TSF probably performs as well as other treatments for reducing the intensity of drinking (of alcohol). AA/TSF probably performs as well as other treatments for alcohol-related consequences and addiction severity. Four of the five economics studies found substantial cost-saving benefits for AA/TSF, which indicate that AA/TSF interventions probably reduce healthcare costs substantially.
In conclusion, clinically-delivered TSF interventions designed to increase AA participation usually lead to better outcomes over the subsequent months to years in terms of producing higher rates of continuous abstinence. This effect is achieved largely by fostering increased AA participation beyond the end of the TSF intervention. AA/TSF will probably produce substantial healthcare cost savings while simultaneously improving alcohol abstinence. Our certainty in the evidence ranged from very low to high for the different outcomes. Most of the high-certainty evidence was based on the results from studies with reliable study designs (randomized controlled trials) and good measurement methods. We considered some evidence to be of low certainty, partly because of inadequate methods for deciding which treatment each person in the study was to receive, which can allow factors other than the treatments to affect the results.There was some inconsistency in the evidence across studies that could be due to variation in the clinical characteristics of the participants, times of follow-up, error in participant recall of certain outcomes, and differences in intervention durations, or therapist effects. Some studies had small sample sizes, which led to less precise estimates of the longest periods of abstinence, and high variability around estimates of drinks per drinking day.
This review found three small trials in adult haemodialysis patients (n = 117). The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre-ESRD patients and none in children. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide strong evidence.
This systematic review was undertaken to help inform the 2013 WHO guidelines which aimed to revise the recommendations of when to start therapy in 2 to 5 years old children. The authors identified two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared immediate with deferred initiation of cART in HIV-positive children aged 1 to 12 years in Thailand or Cambodia. Additional analyses of 122 children enrolled in the two studies at ages 2 to 5 years were made available for this review. A cohort study from South Africa in HIV-positive children (median age 3.5 years) starting tuberculosis treatment and ART was also included. Results showed that we still lack enough evidence to determine whether early or late initiation of cART is best in children aged 2 to 5 years. The authors recognized the lack of evidence but highlighted the potential value of simplifying WHO recommendations to start cART in all children below five years with the goal of providing programmatic advantage to treatment programmes in resource-limited settings.
We identified all randomized controlled trials in ALS/MND and wrote to the authors to request the data needed to complete this review. Although many more studies were eligible for inclusion, only five authors were willing and able to share the data from their individual randomized controlled trials. Based on the analyses of these data, we find no evidence to support a statistically significant difference in the response to treatment between people with the familial and sporadic forms of ALS/MND.
Authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 17 June 2015. It includes 14 studies published from 1991 to 2015 in which 1316 participants were randomised (1280 of whom were included in the analyses) to receive oral cryotherapy versus standard care (usually saline mouthrinses) or no treatment or a different treatment or a different method of oral cryotherapy, and the number of people developing oral mucositis of different severities was compared. Nearly all the evidence was on adults receiving oral cryotherapy versus standard care or no treatment. This evidence fell into two main groups: 1) adults receiving fluorouracil-based (5FU) treatment for solid cancers; or 2) adults receiving high-dose melphalan-based cancer treatment before haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT is given to help the body to produce all types of blood cells, which are destroyed during cancer treatment. There is evidence showing that oral cryotherapy can lead to large reductions in the numbers of adults who get oral mucositis of all severities after receiving 5FU-based treatment for solid cancers. There is less certain evidence to suggest that oral cryotherapy may reduce the numbers of adults who get oral mucositis after receiving high-dose melphalan-based cancer treatment prior to HSCT. The evidence suggests that it does reduce oral mucositis in these adults, but the size of the reduction is much less certain. However, there is more certain evidence that there is a large reduction in severe oral mucositis in these adults.
Oral cryotherapy did not cause any serious side effects in any of the participants of these studies, and most people seemed able to carry it out properly and complete it. The evidence presented, on the main outcome of whether or not people developed oral mucositis of all severities, is of moderate (because the nature of the oral cryotherapy treatment meant that the studies could not be 'blinded' which is a desirable characteristic of these studies) to low quality (because in addition to the above problem, the results of the individual studies were too different to give a precise result when they were combined).
Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration examined the evidence available up to August 5, 2013. Fourteen studies tested six herbal medications and included 2050 adults with non-specific acute or chronic LBP. Two oral herbal medications,Harpagophytum procumbens(devil's claw) andSalix alba(white willow bark), were compared to placebo (fake or sham pills) or to rofecoxib (Vioxx®). Three topical creams, plasters, or gels,Capsicum frutescens(cayenne),Symphytum officinaleL. (comfrey), andSolidago chilensis(Brazilian arnica), were compared to placebo creams or plasters and a homeopathic gel. One essential oil, lavender, was compared to no treatment. The average age of people included in the trials was 52 years and studies usually lasted three weeks. Devil's claw, in a standardized daily dose of 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may reduce pain more than placebo; a standardized daily dose of 60 mg reduced pain about the same as a daily dose of 12.5 mg of Vioxx®. While willow bark, in a standardized daily dose of 120 mg and 240 mg of salicin reduced pain more than placebo; a standardized daily dose of 240 mg reduced pain about the same as a daily dose of 12.5 mg of Vioxx® (a non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug). Cayenne was tested in several forms: in plaster form, it reduced pain more than placebo and about the same as the homeopathic gel Spiroflor SLR. Two other ointment-based medications,S. officinaleandS. chilensisappeared to reduce perception of pain more than placebo creams. Lavender essential oil applied by acupressure appeared effective in reducing pain and improving flexibility compared to conventional treatment. Adverse effects were reported, but appeared to be primarily confined to mild, transient gastrointestinal complaints or skin irritations. Most included trials were at low risk of bias and the quality of the evidence was mainly very low to moderate. A moderate grade of evidence was only found forC. frutescens. Trials only tested the effects of short term use (up to six weeks). Authors of eight of the included trials had a potential conflict of interest and four other authors did not disclose conflicts of interest. Vioxx® has been withdrawn from the market because of adverse effects, so all three substances should be compared to readily-available pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, for relative effectiveness and safety. Low to moderate quality evidence shows that four herbal medicines may reduce pain in acute and chronic LBP in the short-term and have few side effects. There is no evidence yet that any of these substances are safe or efficacious for long-term use. Large, well-designed trials are needed to further test the efficacy of these interventions.
The aim of this review is to find out whether the use of NPWT is effective in the treatment of pressure ulcers in any care setting. We wanted to assess the benefits (complete wound healing; healing time) and risks (adverse events) of NPWT with alternative treatments or different types of NPWT in the treatment of pressure ulcers. We also cared about several other outcomes including quality of life, wound infection, change in ulcer size and severity, pain, cost, resource use, and wound recurrence. We searched the medical literature for published and unpublished robust medical studies (randomised controlled studies) that assessed NPWT for treating pressure ulcers, with no restrictions on language, date of publication, or study setting. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence according to research methods, scale, and other factors. We found eight studies published between 2002 and 2022 involving a total of 327 participants with pressure ulcers at Category/Stage III or above. Five studies compared NPWT with dressings. Only one study with a total of 12 participants reported usable primary outcome data (complete wound healing; adverse events) and found that there was no evidence of a difference in the number of participants with complete wound healing and adverse events in the NPWT group and the dressing group.  Three studies reported that NPWT may reduce the size of pressure ulcers compared with dressing, but the results were not reported clearly and the certainty of evidence was very low. One study with a total of 60 participants compared NPWT combined with Internet-plus home care compared with standard care. This study reports that NPWT combined with Internet-plus home care may reduce the surface area of ulcers, pain, and dressing change times compared with standard care, but due to the risk of bias in the study, we downgraded the certainty of evidence to a very low level. One study compared NPWT with a series of topical treatments and one study compared it with what was described only as 'moist wound healing', but no useful data were obtained. The current evidence on the efficacy of NPWT in the treatment of pressure ulcers is limited, and most studies were small (median 37 participants), poorly reported, of fairly short or unclear duration, and contained little in the way of useful data. We were not able to draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of NPWT in treating pressure ulcers based on existing evidence. High-quality research is still needed to help decision-makers judge the value of NPWT in the treatment of pressure ulcers. This evidence is current to January 2022.
In this review, we evaluated 16 studies (involving 4759 participants) of healthcare workers or volunteers (a 'stroke liaison worker') providing education and social support (including counselling) and liaison with services. Overall, there do not appear to be any significant benefits for patients in terms of their perceived health, mood, activities or participation. Patients appeared to be more satisfied that someone had really listened to them, and carers appeared to be more satisfied with aspects of the care provided. It also appears that patients with mild to moderate disability may benefit from a reduction in disability and death as a result of the input from the stroke liaison worker. The reason for this is not yet clear and further research is required.
We found 30 randomised trials of iron supplementation in blood donors with a total of 4704 participants. We found that some of the studies did not report details of their design very well and people in some of the studies left the study early and did not contribute data. Combining the results from four studies, we have shown that around 3% of donors who were given iron supplements were unable to give blood when they next came to donate because the levels of iron in their blood were too low, compared with 10% of donors who did not take iron. More than this, 4% of iron-supplemented donors were unable to give blood at any future donation due to low iron levels, compared with around 20% of donors not given iron supplementation.
However, 29% of donors who took iron tablets experienced side effects compared with 17% of donors who were given dummy tablets. Combined data from two studies showed that the iron-supplemented donors had nearly five times the chance of stomach upsets and changes in their taste compared to donors who did not take these tablets.
Due to the issues around how reliable the studies were, the quality of evidence is moderate and these results could change with more research.
Donors can benefit from iron tablets but the rate of side effects is high, which means in practice that giving all donors iron tablets is unlikely to be acceptable and we do not know whether giving iron causes extra problems over a long period of time. Blood services may target iron supplementation at groups or individuals who are at risk of iron deficiency or may try to reduce deferral by adjusting donation intervals to suit the donor's ability to give blood without becoming iron deficient or to give specific dietary advice to donors.
We identified seven trials involving 1558 participants where the aneurysm diameters of patients randomised to receive medical treatment were compared to those participants given a control medication or surveillance imaging alone. Four trials studied the effects of antibiotics on slowing aneurysm growth, and showed a small protective effect. Three trials studied the effects of beta-blockers, and demonstrated a very small protective effect. Notably, the beta-blocker drugs were associated with a large number of adverse effects. It was unclear whether either drug type delayed referral to aneurysm surgery.
The accuracy of the results was limited by the low number of participants (especially important when trying to detect small changes in aneurysm growth rates) and some potentially damaging biases.
The review looked to see whether the use of antibiotics in women with bacterial vaginosis reduced the symptoms for women and reduced the incidence of babies being born too early.  We identified  21 trials, involving 7847 women.  We found that antibiotics given to pregnant women reduced this overgrowth of bacteria, but did not reduce the numbers of babies who were born too early. There were adverse effects sufficient to stop treatment or have the treatment changed when antibiotics were used and this needs further investigation. The effect of screening and treating women with abnormal flora needs to be studied in further trials and the effects of screening and treating proven vaginal infections is the subject of another Cochrane review.
Since there are several reviews describing the effects of different types of financial incentives, it is important to bring this together in an overview to examine which are best at changing healthcare professionals' behaviours and what happens to patients. We therefore conducted an overview of systematic reviews that evaluated the impact of financial incentives on healthcare professional behaviour and patient outcomes. We searched a wide range of electronic databases from when they started up to December 2008. We included systematic reviews of studies evaluating the effectiveness of any type of financial incentive. We grouped financial incentives into five groups: payment for working for a specified time period; payment for each service, episode or visit; payment for providing care for a patient or specific population; payment for providing a pre-specified level or providing a change in activity or quality of care; and mixed or other systems. We summarised data using vote counting. We identified four reviews reporting on 32 studies. Two reviews were of moderate quality and two were of high quality. The studies that the reviews reported on were of low to moderate quality. Payment for working for a specified time period was generally ineffective. Payment for each service, episode or visit was generally effective, as were payment for providing care for a patient or specific population and payment for providing a pre-specified level or providing a change in activity or quality of care; mixed and other systems were of mixed effectiveness. When looking at the effect of financial incentives overall across different outcomes, they were of mixed effectiveness on consultation or visit rates; generally effective in improving processes of care, referrals and admissions, and prescribing costs; and generally ineffective in improving compliance with guidelines outcomes. On the basis of these findings, we concluded that financial incentives may be effective in changing healthcare professional practice. The evidence has serious methodological limitations and is also very limited in its completeness and generalisability. We found no evidence that financial incentives can improve patient outcomes.
Sixteen studies involving 3,005 people are included in this review. We did not find strong evidence that either mechanical or pharmacological interventions reduce death or clots travelling to the lungs, but we found some evidence that they can prevent clots from forming in the legs.
A review of the current literature suggests that reduction in the amount of dietary sodium consumed has no significant effect on the symptoms of asthma but may be associated with improvements in some lung function measurements in exercise-induced asthma.
In June 2015 and June 2016, we explored the medical literature and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study-based register using appropriate keywords to find any studies which evaluated a method that guided or helped health professionals with how to deliver the news about the diagnosis of schizophrenia. We specifically searched for randomised controlled trials as these are considered the best way (gold standard) to evaluate the effects of treatments. We identified 44 publications and inspected these. From these, we obtained seven full reports of trials and that we thought could be relevant; however, none of these studies could be included in the review. Currently health professionals can use good quality, evidence based information to guide them in the sharing of news about diagnosis of a serious physical illnesses; however, there is no such evidence available concerning the sharing of news about the diagnosis of schizophrenia. This is a serious gap in knowledge which needs attention and studies are needed in this area.
Several strategies have been used to decrease akathisia, and this review is one in a series over viewing the effects of drug treatments. Evidence for the use of benzodiazepines is so limited that no firm treatment recommendations are possible, although there may be some effects that are worthy of further investigation.
We found six studies focused on young children aged one to four years; two of these studies were included in the original review and four were new studies. The two studies included in the original review used a low concentration of sucrose, just 12%, which is not considered sweet enough for the pain reducing effects. Three of the four new studies were small pilot studies, conducted to inform full trials, and only one study of sweet solutions in young children included large numbers of children. When we compared results of all six studies, only two showed that sugar water (sucrose) reduced pain during injections. However, the four studies that showed no effect all included small numbers of children, therefore they were not considered large enough to detect significant differences in pain. Further well conducted trials with large enough numbers of young children are needed to work out if sweet taste effectively reduces their pain and distress during needles.
For older school-aged children, there were two studies published by the same author, both of which were included in the original review. Neither study showed that sweet taste helped to reduce pain. As other studies show that strategies such as distraction and topical anaesthetics can effectively reduce needle pain in school-aged children, further studies of sweet taste for pain management in school-aged children are not warranted. 
Of the six studies including young children, two did not acknowledge receipt of research funding. For the remaining four: a state-wide nursing fund supported two of the pilot studies, an internal research institute provided support for the remaining pilot study and another study was supported in part by a Maternal and Child Health grant.
The two studies including school-aged children, conducted by the same author, were supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
We found 10 studies involving 10,894 participants comparing the long-term effectiveness and side effects of combining tiotropium with a LABA. The combination of tiotropium plus LABA resulted, on average, in a slightly better quality of life and lung function for the participants compared to using only either tiotropium or a LABA alone, but did not show a difference in hospital admissions or death. The combination treatment also reduced the risk of episodes of acutely worse symptoms ('exacerbations'), compared to a LABA alone but not tiotropium. There were not enough data to determine the risks and benefits of the different types of LABA.
Some studies have evaluated the therapeutic effects of repetitive TMS in controlled studies on patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder observing some changes in their behaviour in terms of compulsive urges or improvements in mood. This review has evaluated the current evidence for TMS as a therapeutic treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). There is a lack of evidence for the effect of TMS in the treatment of OCD.
We found 21 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared the effects of OCPs with either placebo (fake pill), other OCPs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines that reduce pain and inflammation. The studies included 3723 women. Most women had painful menstrual cramps of at least moderate severity. Manufacturers of OCPs funded 11 studies. We searched the databases in March 2023.  OCPs reduce pain by 0.7 to 1.3 points more on the total dysmenorrhoea scale (range 0 to 6) than placebo in women with menstrual cramps (6 studies with 588 women; high-quality evidence). The six studies that measured improvement as a yes/no category showed that OCPs may reduce pain. Women with a 28% chance of improving on placebo may have a 37% to 60% chance of improving on OCPs (low-quality evidence).
OCPs increase the risk of side effects (59% in placebo group compared to 71% to 86% in OCP group; moderate-quality evidence), and may lead to more serious side effects (1.1% in placebo group compared to 0.5% to 6.8% in OCP group; low-quality evidence).
Irregular bleeding increases among women using OCPs. Women with an 18% risk of irregular bleeding on placebo have a 39% to 60% risk of irregular bleeding on OCPs (high-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence found that OCPs probably increase the risk of headaches (17% in placebo group compared to 19% to 35% in OCP group), and nausea (feeling sick; 10% in placebo group compared to 11% to 22% in OCP group).
We are uncertain of the effect of OCP on weight gain.
Low-quality evidence found that OCPs may slightly reduce the need for extra medicine (38% in placebo group compared to 15% to 37% in OCP group), and absence from work (36% in placebo group compared to 11% to 35% in OCP group). There may be little or no difference between OCPs that contain low or high doses of oestrogen, or between newer and older formulations of OCPs (moderate-quality evidence).
Using continuous OCP (no inactive pills taken as a break between active pills, to postpone bleeding) might reduce pain more than the traditional regimen (low-quality evidence). The traditional regimen is to take active tablets for 21 days and pausing for 7 days (or taking inactive tables for 7 days) where a breakthrough bleeding will usually occur.
There might be little or no difference in the risk of any side effects between the continuous and traditional regimens (65% in traditional group compared to 66% to 80% in continuous group; low-quality evidence).
Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain if there is a difference in the risk of serious side effects (0.9% in traditional group compared to 0.3% to 7.7% in continuous group), headaches (8% in traditional group compared to 4% to 15% in continuous group), nausea (6% in traditional group compared to 3% to 13% in continuous group) or absence from work (9% in traditional group compared to 6% to 18% in continuous group). Continuous use of OCP probably increases irregular bleeding (33% in traditional group compared to 38% to 56% in continuous group; moderate-quality evidence).
These studies did not report on weight gain or the need for extra medicine. Due to low-quality evidence, we were unable to determine whether OCPs were more effective than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines. Side effects were not reported. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high. The most important problems were a lack of data and variations in data between studies.
No trials were included in this review. The review authors concluded that there is inadequate evidence to draw any conclusions about the efficacy or safety of acupuncture for ADHD in children and adolescents. There is an urgent need for further large scale, multicenter, randomised, controlled, double-blinded studies of acupuncture with standardized evaluation of outcomes for ADHD in children and adolescents.
We searched for studies comparing UF to usual care in people with AHF. We searched for all relevant studies up to June 2021 and found 14 studies with about 1200 people. People who were very sick and frail, such as those who have had heart attacks and infections, were often not studied. We used a validated tool (GRADE) to assess how certain we were of our results. Overall, there was low-certainty evidence from these studies because of variability in the study settings, conflicting results between studies and limitations in how the studies were designed. We are uncertain whether UF has an impact on death rates at a short-term follow-up, as there are not enough data. At the longest time of follow-up, UF may have little effect on death rates.
UF may reduce readmission to hospital rates within the short and long term. In particular, readmission rates from heart failure are probably reduced by 31% when followed up over a longer time frame (up to one year). The benefit of reducing heart failure-related rehospitalisation is seen in 1 of 10 people treated with UF.
UF may increase the risk of needing long-term dialysis. It is not clear whether UF affects kidney function at 30 days since hospital discharge, or if the risk of central line complications are greater with UF. No studies researched the effect of UF on needing mechanical breathing support, or its effect on cost and health economics.
More robust studies looking at UF in conjunction with current therapy are needed. These should focus on outcomes that are important to patients, such as heart failure-related hospital readmission rates, cardiac death rates and kidney damage at medium to long term.
We included 67 studies involving a total of 1729 adult participants with acute, postacute or chronic ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. The mean age in the experimental groups ranged from 43 years up to 70 years, and from 45 years up to 75 years in the control groups. The level of participants' impairment ranged from severe to moderate. The majority of studies were conducted in an inpatient setting. Several different stimulation types with different stimulation durations and dosages were administered and compared with sham tDCS or an active control intervention. Sham tDCS means that the stimulation is switched off covertly in the first minute of the intervention. This review found that tDCS might enhance ADL, but does not improve arm and leg function, muscle strength and cognitive abilities. Proportions of adverse events and people discontinuing the treatment were comparable between groups. Included studies differed in terms of type, location and duration of stimulation, the amount of current delivered, electrode size and positioning,as well as type and location of stroke. Future research is needed in this area to foster the evidence base of these findings, especially regarding arm and leg function, muscle strength and cognitive abilities (including spatial neglect). The quality of evidence for tDCS for improving ADL ranged from very low to high. It was low to moderate for upper extremity function, and moderate for adverse events and people discontinuing the treatment.
We wanted to know which of these techniques is the best for improving the quality of donated livers. We performed a rigorous search for clinical trials which compared perfusion machines. We planned to include trials which compared perfusions machines with each other, or compared with standard ice-box preservation. Our primary outcomes were death, quality of life, and serious side effects (serious adverse events). We also investigated secondary outcomes of how long the transplanted liver survived, bile duct (thin tubes that go from the liver to the small intestine) damage, and what proportion of the donated livers could be transplanted. We found six trials with 854 transplant recipients from 1124 donated livers. No machine was shown to reduce death, and no trials looked at quality of life. Compared with the standard ice-box technique, cold machine perfusion improved the survival of the liver, reduced the number of serious adverse events, and reduced damage to the bile ducts. Warm machine perfusion with oxygen did not have these benefits. Warm machine perfusion appeared to increase the proportion of donated livers which could be transplanted, but more research is needed to understand why. We found a limited number of trials and some were of mixed quality. The reported data were also insufficient for all planned analyses. None of the trials looked at a machine perfusion technique which is applied in the donor before the organs are removed (termed normothermic regional perfusion). The review includes studies published to 10 January 2023.
We found 21 randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing various drugs plus a behaviour changing intervention such as diet, exercise or both (= intervention groups) usually with placebo (a pretend drug) plus a behaviour changing intervention (= control groups). We also identified eight ongoing studies (studies which are currently running but not completed yet). A total of 2484 children and adolescents took part in the included studies. The length of the intervention period ranged from 12 weeks to 48 weeks, and the length of follow-up ranged from six months to 100 weeks. The included studies investigated metformin (10 studies), sibutramine (six studies), orlistat (four studies) and one study group evaluated the combination of metformin and fluoxetine. The ongoing studies are investigating metformin (four studies), topiramate (two studies) and exenatide (two studies).
Most studies reported on body mass index (BMI) and bodyweight: BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated from weight and height measurements (kg/m2). In children, BMI is often measured in a way that takes into account sex, weight and height as children grow older (BMI z score). The average change in BMI across control groups was between a 1.8 kg/m2 reduction to a 0.9 kg/m2 increase, while across all intervention groups the average reduction was more pronounced (1.3 kg/m2 reduction). The same effect was observed for weight change: on average, children and adolescents in the intervention groups lost 3.9 kg more weight than the children and adolescents in the control groups. Study authors reported an average of serious side effects in 24 per 1000 participants in the intervention groups compared with an average of 17 per 1000 participants in the control groups. The numbers of participants dropping out of the study because of side effects were 40 per 1000 in the intervention groups and 27 per 1000 in the control groups. The most common side effects in the orlistat and metformin studies were gut (such as diarrhoea and mild tummy pain). Common side effects in the sibutramine trials included increased heart rate (tachycardia), constipation and high blood pressure. The fluoxetine study reported dry mouth and loose stools. One study reported health-related quality of life (a measure of physical, mental, emotional and social functioning) and found no marked differences between intervention and control. No study reported the participants' views of the intervention or socioeconomic effects. Only one study reported on morbidity (how often a disease occurs in a specific area) associated with the intervention, where there were more gallstones after the orlistat treatment. Study authors reported one suicide in the orlistat intervention group. However, studies were not long enough to reliably investigate death from any cause. No study investigated drug treatment for children who were only overweight (obese children have a much higher weight, BMI or BMI z score than children being overweight).
This evidence is up to date to March 2016. The overall certainty of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because there were only a few studies per outcome measurement, the number of included children or adolescents was small, and due to variation in the results of the studies. In addition, many children or adolescents left the studies before the study had finished.
In November 2020, we updated our searches for randomised controlled studies of hydromorphone compared with placebo, an alternative opioid or another active control. Randomised controlled studies are studies where people are randomly placed into different treatment groups. We found four studies that compared hydromorphone with oxycodone, three studies that compared hydromorphone with morphine and one study that compared hydromorphone with fentanyl. This review includes eight studies (four new studies included in this updated version) with 1283 participants comparing hydromorphone with oxycodone, morphine or fentanyl in adults (aged 18 years and above) with moderate to severe cancer pain. None of the studies compared hydromorphone and placebo. None of the studies included children.
We found no differences in pain intensity scores between the different treatment groups and on average patients reported low levels of pain after opioid administration. Hydromorphone seemed to work as well as morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl. There were some side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness and constipation, but generally there was no clear difference between people taking hydromorphone and people taking morphine, oxycodone or fentanyl. We rated the certainty of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate or high. Very low-certainty evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-certainty evidence means that we are very confident in the results. No results were rated as high certainty; we only identified very low-certainty evidence for pain intensity, pain relief and side effects. These outcomes were rated as very low certainty because there were either few trials included with few participants, or due to other sources of bias, such as potential competing interests with the pharmaceutical industry. The studies did not provide enough high-certainty evidence to draw firm conclusions; the evidence of the benefits and harms of hydromorphone compared with other medicines is very uncertain.
Other Cochrane reviews provide clear evidence that giving anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D) within 72 hours of the birth to a Rh-negative mother of a Rh-positive baby and during the third trimester reduces Rh antibody formation in future pregnancies. The chances of developing Rh antibodies may also be reduced if anti-D is given to Rh-negative women following a spontaneous miscarriage or a dilatation & curettage (D&C) for incomplete miscarriage after 12 weeks. However, our review only identified one poor quality randomised controlled trial (involving 48 women) that considered anti-D administration after therapeutic D&C or spontaneous miscarriage for preventing Rh alloimmunisation (development of antibodies in response to antigens from a non-self protein). The included study did not report any data on the review's primary or secondary outcomes. More high-quality research is needed in this field.
We included one study of 70 participants aged 12 to 50 years old with Marfan syndrome, who were assigned to either a beta-blocker called propranolol or no treatment for an average duration of 9.3 years in the control (no treatment) group and 10.7 years in the treatment group. This study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Health, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the National Marfan Foundation. Propranolol compared to no treatment did not reduce mortality or morbidity, including aortic dissection, aortic regurgitation (leaking of the aortic valve causing reverse blood flow into the heart), heart failure (inability to pump enough blood around the body), and heart surgery. However, it reduced the rate of enlargement of the aortic diameter. Harms have not been fully reported in this study. We judged this trial to have high risk of bias and low-quality evidence. This study provides inadequate evidence to inform people with Marfan syndrome, their families and care-providers.
We included 27 studies in our analysis. Studies were conducted in Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia, Europe, and the Western Pacific, and included urban and rural settings, as well as high-, middle-, and low-income settings.
Many complex factors were found to influence parents’ vaccination views and practices, which we divided into four themes.
Firstly, parents’ vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by their broader ideas and practices surrounding health and illness generally, and specifically with regards to their children, and their perceptions of the role of vaccination within this context. Secondly, many parents’ vaccination ideas and practices were influenced by the vaccination ideas and practices of the people they mix with socially. At the same time, shared vaccination ideas and practices helped some parents establish social relationships, which in turned strengthened their views and practices around vaccination. Thirdly, parent’s vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by wider political issues and concerns, and particularly their trust (or distrust) in those associated with vaccination programmes. Finally, parent’s vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by their access to and experiences of vaccination services and their frontline healthcare workers.
We developed two concepts for understanding possible pathways to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination.
The first concept, ‘neoliberal logic’, suggests that many parents, particularly from high-income countries, understood health and healthcare decisions as matters of individual risk, choice, and responsibility. Some parents experienced this understanding as in conflict with vaccination programmes, which emphasise generalised risk and population health. This perceived conflict led some parents to be less accepting of vaccination for their children.
The second concept, ‘social exclusion’, suggests that some parents, particularly from low- and middle-income countries, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their experiences of social exclusion. Social exclusion may damage trustful relationships between government and the public, generate feelings of isolation and resentment, and give rise to demotivation in the face of public services that are poor quality and difficult to access. These factors in turn led some parents who were socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a way to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, costs, and distress it creates. We searched for studies published before 3 June 2020.
We included 9 randomised controlled trials, with a total of 363 participants. No studies examined surgical methods.
Photodynamic therapy appears to be an effective treatment and has the benefit of minimal scarring compared with cryotherapy or 5-fluorouracil. Cryotherapy is convenient and less expensive, but does not appear to be as effective as photodynamic therapy and results in more scarring; 5-aminolevulinic acid with photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) appears to be more effective than 5-fluorouracil, whereas methyl aminolevulinate with photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) does not appear to be as good as 5-fluorouracil. One study demonstrated benefit with imiquimod cream.
Specific recommendations cannot be made from these data, so this review cannot give firm conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of treatments. There is a clear need for future research to focus on a range of different studies comparing various therapies with each other, and in particular to surgical treatments to provide high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice. The age group, number and size of lesions, sites affected, and immunological status may all influence therapeutic choices. Longer-term follow up (up to 10 years) is needed to determine the effect of treatments on risk of progression of lesions of Bowen's disease to squamous cell carcinoma.
Standard diagnosis of malaria in the past has depended on blood microscopy, but this requires a technician and a laboratory, and is often not feasible for basic health services in many areas. Sometimes in research studies, another technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used, but again this requires equipment and trained staff, and cannot be used routinely. Technological advances have led to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria. These detect parasite-specific antigens in the blood, are simple to use, and can give results as a simple positive or negative result, within 15 minutes.
This review evaluates the accuracy of RDTs compared with microscopy and PCR for detecting Plasmodium falciparum parasites in the blood. It includes 74 studies, giving a total of 111 RDT evaluations (of which 104 compared RDTs with microscopy), reporting a total of 60,396 RDT results. Results are presented by type of test, classified by the malaria antigen that they are designed to detect (either histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2), or plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)).
The results indicate that RDTs can be very accurate compared to microscopy and PCR. The performance of RDT types varied but the differences were not large. HRP-2-based tests tended to be more sensitive (ie they identified more true cases of malaria) and less specific (ie they wrongly identified more malaria that was not present) than pLDH-based tests. Choice will depend on prevalence of malaria, and we provide data in this review to assist these decisions, although policy makers will also take into account other factors relating to cost and test stability.
The review of trials found that intravenous immunoglobulin given within the first 10 days of the disease reduces the risk of damage to the coronary arteries of the heart in children, without serious adverse effects.
This review considered the effectiveness of a programme of physical exercise involving brisk walking and moderate resistance training tailored for the needs of the older adult. These reviewers report that evidence from one small trial is encouraging, and further research is needed.
We searched for all trials that compared continuous monitoring with intermittent monitoring in people with acute stroke. We identified three studies including a total of 354 participants. Stroke unit care with continuous monitoring was associated with a significant reduction in the chance of being dead or disabled after the stroke. Unfortunately this evidence is not entirely reliable because of the small number of participants, differences in the definitions of abnormal results, and the less reliable methods used in the largest trial. Further research is required to answer many remaining questions, such as when to start continuous monitoring, when to interrupt it, which people should be given priority, and which treatments are most appropriate after the identification of abnormalities in physiological variables.
We searched for randomised controlled trials in patients of any age with nosebleed requiring intervention. Patients were treated with tranexamic acid (in addition to usual care) compared to placebo, no treatment or any other agent used to stop bleeding. We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 692 participants. Two studies used oral administration of tranexamic acid and four used topical administration. All participants in the studies were adults. Three of the six studies were conducted over 20 years ago. Three studies measured re-bleeding within 10 days. When we combined the results we found that fewer patients who were given either oral or topical tranexamic acid had further episodes of re-bleeding following an initial nosebleed compared to those treated with usual care.
The time to stop initial bleeding (control of bleeding within 30 minutes) was measured in four studies. In three studies the proportion of patients whose bleeding stopped within 10 minutes was significantly higher in the group receiving topical tranexamic acid compared to the group receiving a different drug (topical epinephrine and lidocaine or phenylephrine). In the other study there was no significant difference at 30 minutes when topical tranexamic acid was compared with placebo.
No studies reported the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention (e.g. repacking, surgery).
Only one study of oral tranexamic acid reported the proportion of patients requiring a blood transfusion and there was no evidence of a difference between the groups.
Length of hospital stay was reported in two studies. One study reported a significantly shorter stay in the oral tranexamic acid group, while the other found no evidence of a difference.
Five studies mention recording "adverse effects". None found any difference between the groups in the occurrence of minor adverse effects (e.g. mild nausea and diarrhoea, 'bad taste' of gel). In one study a patient did develop a superficial thrombophlebitis (inflammation and a blood clot in a vein near the surface of the skin) of both legs following discharge, but the study did not report in which treatment group this happened. No serious adverse event was seen in any of the studies. Overall, the risk of bias in the six studies was low. We graded the quality of the evidence for the main outcome (control of epistaxis: re-bleeding within 10 days) as moderate, which means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect and is likely to change the estimate. In light of this and the fact that 'usual care' has changed, with the development of more modern nasal cauterisation and packing techniques, since three of the included studies were carried out, there remains uncertainty about the role of tranexamic acid in the treatment of patients with epistaxis. Newer research into the effect of tranexamic acid as a treatment for nosebleeds would inform future management decisions for this condition.
The evidence in this review is up to date to October 2018.
We included 18 trials that compared HS to IS in people undergoing surgery. The trials included 1087 participants. Five hundred and forty-five (545) participants received HS and 542 received IS during their operations. The participants were randomly assigned to their groups. The studies took place in 11 countries. Study participants were over the age of 18. All studies excluded people with serious health risks from participating. All studies monitored fluid levels during the operation and up to three days after. There were seven deaths in total, three (less than 1%) from the IS group and four (less than 1%) from the HS group. The risk of death was very low in these studies. The studies did not report the occurrence of serious adverse events.
Thirteen studies reported the amount of fluid given. The IS group received a mean of 2.4 L and the HS group received 0.91 L less (1.49 L). The highest amount of sodium in the blood over the course of the study was reported by 16 studies. The IS group had a median of 139 meq/L and the HS group was 7.73 meq/L higher. The normal acceptable range is 136 to 146 meq/L. For deaths and adverse events the trials lacked sufficient size and duration to adequately assess differences. We assessed the quality of evidence for deaths to be very low, and future studies are likely to change the result reported here.
The reporting of the highest amount of sodium is of moderate quality. The measuring of blood sodium during an operation is a common measurement that is unlikely to be misrepresented.
In this review, we searched medical literature databases to identify studies which evaluated how well the Mini-Cog is able to distinguish between individuals who have dementia and those who do not have dementia when compared to in-depth evaluation by dementia specialists. Our review focussed on those studies that were conducted in community based settings. We identified three unique randomised controlled studies that evaluated the Mini-Cog. In these studies the accuracy of the Mini-Cog varied and importantly there were some potential limitations within the studies which may have led to an overestimation of the accuracy of the Mini-Cog. Based on the information that we obtained from our review, we felt that further research into the accuracy of the Mini-Cog was required before it could be recommended for routine use for identifying dementia in community settings.
We found no randomized controlled trials. We found 49 relevant studies, however they were not clinical trials but prospective or retrospective reviews of case series. The quality of evidence was very low because no clinical trial was available. This is an updated review, and an updated search was undertaken in which no new studies were found. No randomized controlled clinical trials are available to evaluate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery in patients with DMD. Randomized controlled clinical trials are needed in this group of patients to evaluate the benefits and risks of different surgical treatments.
The evidence is current to 5 January 2015.
We included six trials in this review, with a total number of 3847 participants. In all the trials, one group received IPT and the control group received placebo. Three trials were done in low malaria endemicity areas and the other three in high endemicity areas. In some trials, iron supplements were also given to children, which is also a treatment for anaemia, and we took this into consideration when analysing the data.
Our results did not find that the number of children who died or were admitted to hospital was lower in the group receiving IPT, irrespective of whether they received iron (moderate quality evidence ); and there was no difference in the number of children with anaemia at the end of follow-up (moderate quality evidence ). Average haemoglobin levels were higher in the IPT group compared to the placebo group, but the effect was modest (low quality evidence).
Although our results show that there are small benefits in haemoglobin levels when treating anaemic children with IPT, we did not detect an effect on death or hospital admissions. However, three of the six included trials were conducted in low endemicity areas where malaria transmission is low and thus any protective effect is likely to be modest.
This review compared the clinical effects of clozapine with the other atypical antipsychotics. Twenty-seven studies fulfilled the review's criteria and provided data to compare clozapine with antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and zotepine. Clozapine was somewhat more efficacious than zotepine. Also, inefficacy of treatment led more frequently to leaving the studies early in the risperidone group suggesting a certain higher efficacy of clozapine. The principal drawback of clozapine were its adverse effects which lead to significantly higher numbers of participants leaving the studies early compared to olanzapine and risperidone. Clozapine was associated with more sedation and hypersalivation than olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone and with more seizures than olanzapine and risperidone. There was a higher incidence of white blood cell decrease in clozapine groups than olanzapine and more weight gain than in risperidone groups. On the other hand clozapine produced fewer movement disorder than risperidone and less prolactin increase than olanzapine, quetiapine and zotepine.
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials in June 2018. This updated review now includes eight studies involving 4464 women and their babies. One of the new studies was very well conducted and accounted for three-quarters of all women in the review. Five trials were conducted in the UK, one in France and two in Spain. They compared various upright positions with lying-down (recumbent) positions.
Overall, there may be little or no difference between upright and lying-down positions for caesarean section or instrumental vaginal (operative) births (8 trials, 4316 women; low-quality evidence). The studies showed considerable variations in findings. However, when we looked only at the high-quality studies we found a clear harm from upright positions (3 trials, 3609 women). There was evidence of an increased risk of operative birth (instrumental or caesarean birth combined) and an increase in caesarean births.
There was no difference in the number of women who had tears requiring stitches (3 trials, 3266 women; low-quality evidence) or suffering excessive bleeding (1 trial; 3093 women; moderate-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether the upright position has any impact on instrumental vaginal birth or the length of the second stage of labour, because we found the quality of the evidence to be very low for these outcomes.
Mothers were slightly more satisfied with lying-down positions (1 trial, 2373 women). Although more babies had high acid levels in the cord at birth with lying-down positions (2 trials, 3159 infants; moderate-quality evidence), there was no other evidence of baby harm. Suitable lying-down positions were on the left or right side, but not flat on their back nor with the legs raised in stirrups. The overall evidence did not show a clear difference in operative births for women with an epidural during the second stage of labour. Differences in how well the studies were designed and conducted and differing positions adopted may account for this. However, the high-quality evidence showed better outcomes for women moving between lying-down on the side positions that avoided lying flat on the back. These positions result in more normal births, a better experience and no harm to mother or baby when compared with an upright position.
High-flow oxygen therapy may lead to a reduced need for invasive respiratory support (e.g. intubation) and may have a clinical advantage over other treatments by preventing drying of the upper airway. This review assessed the effects of high-flow nasal cannula therapy, compared with other respiratory support, in the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis. Sixteen studies (2813 participants) met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared either high-flow to conventional oxygen therapy (low-flow) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). These studies were based in paediatric wards and intensive care units around the world. We identified 11 trials comparing high-flow to low-flow, involving a total of 2322 infants, and five studies involving a total of 491 infants comparing high-flow to CPAP. In each study we focussed on comparing length of hospital stay, changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, and clinical scoring criteria, as well as numbers of adverse events and need for treatment to be escalated. We analysed these data to determine whether either intervention was superior and any differences were statistically significant. We divided our review into studies comparing high-flow to low-flow, and studies comparing high-flow to CPAP.
When comparing high-flow to low-flow, we found a difference, favouring high-flow, with a reduction in the length of hospital stay and the duration of oxygen therapy.
The reduction in the length of hospital stay was found to be 0.65 days (15.6 hours), and the reduction in the duration of oxygen therapy was 0.59 days (14.2 hours). These reductions are modest and may not have significant clinical impact when applied in the real world.
We also found a difference, favouring high-flow, in a greater reduction in respiratory and heart rates, as well as fewer incidences of need to escalate treatment.
We did not find a difference between the high-flow and low-flow groups in the incidence of adverse events (including medical events such as bleeding and lung collapse, as well as equipment issues).
In all studies, high-flow was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events recorded when compared to low-flow and CPAP.
We did not have enough studies comparing high-flow to CPAP to be able to compare or combine results (meta-analysis). High-flow nasal cannula oxygen is more effective than low-flow in terms of reduction in respiratory and heart rates, length of hospital stay, and duration of oxygen therapy, as well as the need for treatment escalation. Due to considerable differences between studies (heterogeneity), as well as risk of biases, we are only moderately confident in the evidence found for many of these outcomes.
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of high-flow nasal cannula therapy when compared to CPAP for the treatment of bronchiolitis in infants and further studies are required to determine its role. This evidence is current to 8 December 2022.
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature that compared interventions to reduce aerosol production during dental procedures against other interventions or no intervention. We then compared the results, and summarized the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorized the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. We found 16 studies that involved a total of 425 people. Studies involved between one and 80 participants, who were aged between 5 and 69 years. Six studies were conducted in the USA, five in India, two in the UK and one each in Egypt, the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates.
The studies evaluated one or more of the following devices:
- high-volume evacuator (7 studies);
- hands-free suction device (2 studies);
- saliva ejector (1 study);
- rubber dam (3 studies);
- rubber dam with a high-volume evacuator (1 study); or
- air cleaning system (1 study).
None of the studies evaluated the risk infectious disease transmission. Nor did they evaluate cost, acceptability or ease of implementation.
All 16 studies measured changes in the levels of bacterial contamination in aerosols, but we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. This means that we have very little confidence in the evidence, and that we expect further research to change the findings of our review. We therefore cannot deduce from this evidence whether there is an effect on levels of bacterial contamination. No studies investigated viral or fungal contamination. We do not know whether interventions that aim to reduce aerosol production during dental procedures prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. This review highlights the need for more and better-quality studies in this area. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to September 2020.
We searched and reviewed all randomised controlled trials that had been undertaken to evaluate the benefit of CPAP in adult patients with sleep apnoea. Some of the trials had methodological flaws, although more recent studies have begun to use appropriate forms of control. The overall results demonstrate that in people with moderate to severe sleep apnoea CPAP can improve measures of sleepiness, quality of life and associated daytime sleepiness. CPAP leads to lower blood pressure compared with control, although the degree to which this is achieved may depend upon whether people start treatment with raised blood pressures. Oral appliances are also used to treat sleep apnoea but, whilst some people find them more convenient to use than CPAP, they do not appear to be as effective at keeping the airway open at night. Further good quality trials are needed to define who benefits, by how much and at what cost. Further trials are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP in comparison to other interventions, particularly those targeted at obesity.
This review searched the available evidence that was up to date at 22 February 2017. We found 15 relevant studies including 3760 participants with an average age of 25 years (range 3 to 101) where 48% were male. The follow-up period in the trials ranged from 6 to 36 months. Two of the 15 studies declared financial support from companies that made tooth-filling material. In addition, we found four ongoing studies. There is low-quality evidence to suggest that primary teeth treated with the ART approach using high viscosity glass ionomer cement may be more likely than those receiving conventional treatment with the same material to result in restoration failure. In the treatment of primary teeth, ART may reduce pain experience compared with conventional treatment. The evidence available for evaluating the differences between ART and conventional treatments using other restorative materials or in permanent teeth is very low quality so we cannot draw any conclusions. None of the included studies reported on negative side effects or costs. The available evidence is low- to very low-quality. It is likely that further high-quality research may change our findings. There are four ongoing studies that may provide more information in the future.
We found no trials for inclusion in the review. We found no eligible trials for inclusion in the review. Multicentre, randomised controlled trials (compared to placebo or other available treatment, i.e. blood transfusion and iron chelation) are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of hydroxyurea for reducing the need for blood transfusion, for maintaining or improving average levels of haemoglobin, as well as for assessing whether treatment is cost-effective.
We wanted to find out if ultrasound or shockwave therapy help recently broken bones to heal more quickly. We also wanted to find out if it improved people's quality of life, and function of the injured bone (for example, whether people are able to perform the same day-to-day activities, like walking or brushing their hair, as before their injury), reduced pain and helped people get back to normal activities (such as work) more quickly. We searched for studies in people who had a recent broken bone. Studies compared:
- low or high intensity ultrasound with no treatment or a sham therapy. Sham therapy used a device that looked like ultrasound or shockwave but was not real.
- shockwave therapy with no treatment or sham therapy.
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 21 studies, including 1517 people with recently broken bones. Twenty studies evaluated low-intensity ultrasound treatment and one study evaluated shockwave therapy. No studies evaluated high-intensity ultrasound. The biggest study was in 501 people, with the smallest study in 20 people. Studies were conducted in ten different countries around the world. For ultrasound treatment, we are unsure if there is an effect on people's quality of life, time for the broken bone to heal, pain or whether this treatment had any side effects. This treatment probably makes no difference to the number of bones that heal much later than we expect or do not heal at all, and it may not make a difference to the time it takes for people to return to work. We found no ultrasound studies that reported findings for function.
We found that shockwave treatment may very slightly reduce pain in people who had broken bones in their thigh or shin, but not to a meaningful amount. We are unsure if shockwave treatment reduces the number of bones that heal much later than we expect or that do not heal at all. No shockwave studies reported findings for quality of life, function, time to return to work, or time for the broken bone to heal. Most of the studies were small, and did not report all the findings we were interested in. Many people did not complete the study, and we do not know the results for these missing people. It was possible that some people were aware what treatment they were receiving when a sham device was not used.  We also found that there were a lot of differences in findings between different studies. Overall, this meant that we are not confident in most of our findings. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.
There were few studies found (searches conducted on 30th April 2013) with few antiepileptic drugs compared. One of the four studies included showed evidence that the antiepileptic drug, sulthiame, may have a positive effect in reducing seizure frequency in BECTS in the short term. There were no significant differences in the number of patients with adverse events apart from a higher risk of rash when carbamazepine was compared to topiramate. The number of patients who discontinued treatment as a result of adverse events was also not significant in the studies reviewed. There is insufficient evidence about whether or not treating with antiepileptic drugs has any effect on seizure freedom in the longer term or on a child’s cognition. The optimum treatment has yet to be identified. More research is needed to look into the effectiveness of treatment versus no treatment on seizure control and intellect, and compare the existing treatments.
In September 2016 we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topical phenytoin against other treatments for treating pressure ulcers. We found three small RCTs that included a total of 148 people with pressure ulcers. The average age of participants in two studies was 45 years and 75 years in one study. Twenty-one per cent of participants had grade I ulcers (the least severe type, with swollen but unbroken skin) and 79% had grade II ulcers (slightly more severe). No one had grade III or IV ulcers (the most severe types). The trials compared topical phenytoin with three other treatments for pressure ulcers: hydrocolloid dressings, triple antibiotic ointment, and simple dressings. The results of one study suggested that hydrocolloid dressings may slightly improve ulcer healing compared to topical phenytoin. However, we are uncertain whether topical phenytoin improves ulcer healing compared to simple dressings. The study which compared topical phenytoin with triple antibiotic ointment did not report any outcomes of interest to this review. It is uncertain whether topical phenytoin improves ulcer healing for patients with grade I and II pressure ulcers. No adverse events were reported from three small trials and minimal pain was reported in one trial. The trials did not report on some other measurements that we were interested in, such as cost of treatment and quality of life. Two RCTs had a high risk of bias overall, which might have affected the results, and another RCT did not report sufficient details about how it was conducted. Further rigorous, adequately powered RCTs are needed to find whether topical phenytoin is a helpful medication for treating pressure ulcers.
This plain language summary is up to date as of September 2016.
Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 22 February 2018. A total of 50 randomised controlled trials were included with a total of 3704 participants. Within these studies 34 different sedatives were used, often with inhalational nitrous oxide as well. Dosages and delivery of these drugs varied widely. We grouped studies into those where drugs were compared to a placebo, where drugs were compared to other drugs or where different dosages of drugs were compared. Because all the studies were so different we could only carry out a meta-analysis for studies comparing oral midazolam to a placebo. The review showed that use of oral midazolam made patients more co-operative for dental treatment than a placebo drug. Where reported, adverse effects were few and minor. Oral midazolam probably improves behaviour of children during dental treatment. We evaluated other sedatives but there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions. There is some moderate-certainty evidence that midazolam administered in a drink of juice is effective.
Risk of death or heart attack following either treatment appeared the same, but this may be because too few trial participants were collected together in the review and variation between trials (heterogeneity) may be masking true differences. Further trials of new techniques in a greater variety of patients with subsequent systematic review are needed.
We found three randomized trials (where people were randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that enrolled 274 participants (276 eyes) from Ireland, the US, and Italy. All trials evaluated whether PR or SB was a better treatment for RRD. The study in the US (1989) had 196 participants with six months to two years of follow-up. The study in Ireland (1996) had 20 participants with five to 27 months of follow-up. The study in Italy (2021) enrolled 58 participants with 12 months of follow-up. The evidence is current to 10 March 2021. Studies were funded by the authors' institutions or unknown resources. Results from the three studies suggested that SB may perform better or as well as PR in terms of reattachment rates and for reducing the risk of recurrence of detachment. Few ocular adverse events (eye-related side effects) occurred during either procedure, and differences in some adverse events occurring after the surgeries were very uncertain. More eyes in the SB group experienced cataract and a shift of refraction toward myopia (change to nearsightedness that may be a sign of developing cataract) than eyes in the PR group. The quality of the evidence was mostly low due to poor reporting of how the studies were done. Each study reported visual acuity (clarity or sharpness of vision) differently. None of the studies analyzed important outcomes such as quality of life or costs related to the treatments themselves.
The evidence is current to January 2018.
We found 33 cohort studies examining liver adverse effects after treatment for childhood cancer. There were 7876 cancer patients included that were treated for different types of childhood cancer, especially with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and bone marrow transplantation. The average follow-up duration in the studies that reported this varied from two years after the end of treatment to 25 years since primary cancer diagnosis. We found that 1% to 53% of the childhood cancer survivors developed adverse effects on the liver after cancer treatment, measured by liver enzymes in the blood. Radiotherapy to the liver increases the risk of liver late adverse effects. In addition, busulfan, thioguanine, or liver surgery may increase the risk as well. Also, survivors with chronic viral hepatitis, metabolic syndrome, higher body mass index, higher alcohol intake, statin use, non-Hispanic white ethnicity, longer time since cancer diagnosis, and older age at cancer diagnosis seemed to have an increased risk of liver adverse effects. All studies had problems related to the quality of the evidence.
We found two studies involving 880 participants that compared the benefits and harms of once-daily inhaled ICS/LABA combined in one inhaler versus inhaled LAMA for treatment of adults with COPD. These studies lasted 12 weeks. Participants were men and women aged 40 or older who had COPD with various degrees of severity. No consistent differences were found between the two different types of inhalers included in this review. Researchers reported no major differences in death rate, numbers of COPD exacerbations, lung inflammation, or other serious unwanted events. 
People receiving both inhalers showed similar improvements in quality of life, symptoms, and lung function tests. Overall, we assessed the evidence presented in this review to be of very low quality, which means we have very little confidence in the findings. The main reasons for such judgement include the small number of identified studies and the fact that these studies were not focused on the outcomes of interest for this review. Also, both studies had a short observation time, which means that most of the undesired events may have occurred after the observation period was over. From this review, we did not find evidence strong enough to demonstrate major differences between inhalers or to establish that these inhalers have the same effect.
The trials reviewed compared duloxetine against dummy placebo tablets and also pelvic floor muscle training in women with predominantly stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine reduced the frequency of episodes of incontinence and improved quality of life scores. However, it had little impact on the numbers cured and commonly had side effects, especially nausea. More studies comparing a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor with placebo and surgery are required, especially if conducted independently of pharmaceutical companies.
This review aims to compare CMHTs with inpatient care, hospital-based out-patient care or day hospital (standard care) for people living in the community with a serious mental health problem. Three randomised control trials were found that fulfilled these criteria.  They included a total of 587 people, took place in urban areas of the UK and lasted from three months to one year. In the two studies that recorded it, a total of 52 people from 253 left the study early, though there was no significant difference in numbers between CMHT and control. Deaths in each study were recorded (suicide, suspicious circumstances and physical ill-health), and although there were no significant differences between the two groups, those in the CMHT group were consistently lower than in standard care.  People in CMHTs were also significantly less likely to be admitted to hospital during the period of the study, and were less likely to use social services. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in the use of accident and emergency services, general hospital services and primary care (family doctors). One study looked at satisfaction with care and found those in CMHTs were more satisfied with their care than the standard care group.
In the UK and other Western world countries, the move to CMHT has happened despite the limited evidence given above, therefore improving the evidence base is difficult.  This should be borne in mind when comparing CMHTs with more specialised services such as early intervention or crisis resolution.

We found 30 randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to either an intervention or a control group by a procedure similar to tossing a coin). The studies evaluated a range of resilience interventions in participants aged on average between 19 and 38 years.
Healthcare students were the focus of 22 studies, with a total of 1315 participants (not specified for two studies). Eight studies included mixed samples (1365 participants) of healthcare students and non-healthcare students.
Eight of the included studies compared a mindfulness-based resilience intervention (i.e. an intervention fostering attention on the present moment, without judgements) versus unspecific comparators (e.g. wait-list control receiving the training after a waiting period). Most interventions were performed in groups (17/30), with high training intensity of more than 12 hours or sessions (11/30), and were delivered face-to-face (i.e. with direct contact and face-to-face meetings between the intervention provider and the participants; 17/30).
The included studies were funded by different sources (e.g. universities, foundations), or a combination of various sources (four studies). Seven studies did not specify a potential funder, and three studies received no funding support. A number of things reduce the certainty about whether resilience interventions are effective. These include limitations in the methods of the studies, different results across studies, the small number of participants in most studies, and the fact that the findings are limited to certain participants, interventions and comparators. Resilience training for healthcare students may improve resilience, and may reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress immediately after the end of treatment. Resilience interventions do not appear to reduce depressive symptoms or to improve well-being. However, the evidence from this review is limited and very uncertain. This means that we currently have very little confidence that resilience interventions make a difference to these outcomes and that further research is very likely to change the findings.
Very few studies reported on the short- and medium-term impact of resilience interventions. Long-term follow-up assessments were not available for any outcome. Studies used a variety of different outcome measures and intervention designs, making it difficult to draw general conclusions from the findings. Potential adverse events were only examined in four studies, with three of them showing no undesired effects and one reporting no results. More research is needed, of high methodological quality and with improved study designs.
We identified 20 studies (2832 participants). The studies were conducted in different countries with the majority from the USA. The studies examined three main types of interventions:
1. education and counselling of participants about topics such as epilepsy and medication used to control epilepsy (4 studies);
2. behavioural interventions, such as asking people with epilepsy to link the intention of taking their medication with a particular time, place and other routine activity (13 studies); and
3. mixed interventions, which is the use of more than one intervention (4 studies).
One study is counted twice because it compared a behavioural intervention with a mixed intervention.
Studies measured adherence to medication in various ways, for example, with questionnaires, blood samples or electronic bottle tops. Studies also measured reduction in frequency or severity of seizures to see if taking medication as prescribed made a difference. The studies were all very different from each other, so we could not combine their results. Education and counselling interventions may improve medication adherence. Two studies showed improvement, one study showed a small improvement and one no improvement.
Behavioural and mixed interventions probably improve adherence to medication. People in the intervention groups showed improved adherence compared to the control groups.
Four studies showed that when adherence improved in the intervention groups, seizure frequency or seizure severity was decreased.
We were unable to draw firm conclusions about the results because the studies were very different from each other and did not always use the best methods. This means we are not certain about their evidence. We need carefully-designed randomised controlled studies involving more people with longer follow-up periods to identify the best intervention to improve adherence to antiepileptic medication.
Four trials enrolled approximately 1700 participants and lasted between nine months and two years. Study participants were aged from one month to 15 years. There were different results on the occurrence of nutritional rickets in different settings. Adverse effects were investigated in one study only. 
Considering the partial high frequency of nutritional rickets, the obvious way of action of supplementation of vitamin D or calcium and the favourable risk-benefit ratio, preventive measures are reasonable in high risk groups like infants and toddlers. New studies investigating main and side effects of preventive measures against nutritional rickets in different age groups and in different countries are indicated.
We included seven randomised controlled trials (type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to the treatment groups), published before 10 September 2020, with a total of 843 adult participants who had undergone PD with either standard or extended lymph node removal. There were differences in sample size, treatments, and quality of the research between the studies. We found little or no difference in overall survival between the two groups. It was likely that the operating time was longer, there was more blood loss, and more lymph nodes were removed in the group that underwent extended lymph node resection. However, there was little or no difference in the rate of negative resection margins (i.e. no detectable tumour cells at the cutting surface of the specimen) between the two groups.
We conclude that at present, a more extensive removal of lymph nodes does not improve survival in people with pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinomas. Overall, we found low-quality evidence. The studies used different treatment regimens and different definitions of standard and extended lymph node resection; lack of blinding of the surgeons and other caregivers introduced a risk of performance bias for all outcomes; the use of chemotherapy and other co-interventions was different between studies, and between groups in individual studies. Therefore, we have limited confidence in the estimate of the effect, and the true effect may be substantially different from what we found.
We searched for evidence in September 2017 and included eight trials involving 4009 women receiving ergometrine by mouth (orally), into the muscle (intramuscularly (IM)) or into the vein (intravenously (IV)). Of eight trials, seven included studies were analysed in this updated review.
The evidence from the trials analysed suggests that ergot alkaloids may decrease mean blood loss, increase maternal haemoglobin levels in the blood, and may decrease both blood loss of at least 500 mL (PPH) and the use of therapeutic uterotonics. It is uncertain whether ergot alkaloids have any effect on numbers of women experiencing high blood loss of at least 1000 mL (severe PPH). The evidence also suggested that they may increase adverse effects such as increased blood pressure and pain after birth. They may make little or no difference between groups in terms of other adverse effects (vomiting, nausea, headache or eclamptic fit) and results were inconsistent on the risk of retained or manual removal of placenta. Most of the evidence came from trials that administered ergot alkaloids using the IM or IV route. There was only one small trial that looked at the use of oral ergot alkaloids and results were inconclusive. There were limited numbers of included studies and results between studies were not always consistent or precise. Overall quality of evidence across critical and important outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. The IV or IM route, although it may reduce blood loss and PPH, was associated with the adverse effects of raised blood pressure and pain due to contractions of the uterus. There was not enough evidence on the oral route of administering ergot alkaloids. There are other medications, namely oxytocin, syntometrine and prostaglandins (which are assessed in other Cochrane Reviews), that can be used and may be preferable.
We included four trials, with 177 participants, in the review, 176 of whom were included in the analyses. The treatments compared in the four trials included endoscopic drainage (without EUS guidance), EUS-guided drainage, EUS-guided drainage with nasocystic drainage, and open surgical drainage. The participants were mostly people with pancreatic pseudocysts resulting from sudden onset or long-term inflammation of the pancreas, from different causes. One death occurred in the endoscopic drainage group, due to bleeding. The differences in the serious complications were imprecise. Short-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL; four weeks to three months) was worse, and the costs were higher in the open surgical drainage group than in the EUS-guided drainage group. There were fewer complications of any severity (such as bleeding) that required additional treatment in the EUS-guided drainage with nasocystic drainage group than in the EUS-guided drainage alone or endoscopic drainage groups. Those who received EUS-guided drainage with nasocystic drainage also had a shorter hospital stay compared to those who received EUS-guided drainage alone, endoscopic drainage, or open surgical drainage. Those who received EUS-guided drainage alone had shorter hospital stays than those with open surgical drainage. There was a higher need for additional invasive treatments to completely drain the pseudocyst with endoscopic drainage than EUS-guided drainage alone. The differences for the other comparisons were imprecise. None of the trials reported long-term deaths, medium-term or long-term HRQoL, time-to-return to normal activities, or time-to-return to work. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all the outcomes, because the trials were small and at high risk of bias (for example, prejudice of people who conduct the trial, and trial participants who prefer one treatment over another). As a result, further studies are required on this topic. Such studies should compare EUS-guided drainage with or without nasocystic drainage in people who have symptoms from their pancreatic pseudocysts and need treatment. Such trials should measure patient-oriented outcomes for a minimum follow-up period of two to three years.
We searched the medical literature in September 2016 and included 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1272 women with GDM and their babies. Three trials were supported by commercial partners.
We included five different comparisons:
1) telemedicine (transmission of glucose concentrations from home to healthcare professionals for review) versus standard care (face-to-face review in a clinic/hospital) (five RCTs);
2) self-monitoring of glucose (at home) versus periodic monitoring of glucose (less frequently at face-to-face visits) (two RCTs);
3) use of a continuous glucose monitoring system (CCMS) versus less frequent self-monitoring of glucose (two RCTs);
4) modem technology (transmitting glucose concentrations directly from glucose meters to healthcare professionals) versus telephone transmission of glucose concentrations (one RCT);
5) postprandial (after meal) versus preprandial (before meal) monitoring of glucose (one RCT). there were no clear differences between women in the telemedicine and standard care groups for pre-eclampsia or hypertension, caesarean section or induction of labour; or for their babies being born large-for-gestational age, developing a serious morbidity, or having hypoglycaemia. There were no deaths in the two RCTs that reported on deaths of babies. there were no clear differences between women in the self-monitoring and periodic glucose monitoring groups for pre-eclampsia or caesarean section; or for their babies dying, being born large-for-gestational age, or developing hypoglycaemia. there was no clear difference between women in the CGMS and self-monitoring groups for caesarean section; or for babies being born large-for-gestational age, or developing hypoglycaemia. There were no deaths of babies in the two RCTs. this RCT reported none of the outcomes we considered most important. there were no clear differences between women in the postprandial and preprandial glucose monitoring groups for pre-eclampsia, caesarean section or perineal trauma; or for babies developing hypoglycaemia. Babies born to women in the postprandial glucose monitoring group were less likely to be born large-for-gestational age than babies in the preprandial group.
The quality of the evidence for the above findings was low or very low. None of the 11 RCTs reported on postnatal depression, postnatal weight retention, return to pre-pregnancy weight, or development of type 2 diabetes for the women; or disability, adiposity or development of type 2 diabetes for the babies as children or adults. Blood glucose monitoring is an important strategy for managing GDM, however it remains unclear what methods are best. Conclusive evidence from RCTs is not yet available to guide practice, although a range of methods has been investigated. Few RCTs have compared the same or similar interventions, RCTs have been small and have reported limited findings. Further large, well-designed, RCTs are required to assess the effects of different methods and settings for blood glucose monitoring for women with GDM in order to improve outcomes for women and their babies in the short and long term.
This review looked at the effectiveness of treatments for ELP and included 15 studies, with 473 participants with ELP. All involved oral, but not genital, disease. Many studies were excluded either because they were not randomised controlled trials (where participants are divided into two groups at random) or because they recruited participants with all types of lichen planus, rather than just the erosive subtypes. All of these studies recruited small numbers of participants (12 to 94) and used a variety of different assessment methods and timings; hence, it was not possible to combine or compare results between studies directly.
We found only weak evidence for the effectiveness of any of the treatments for oral ELP. None of the studies involved genital or oesophageal disease; hence, no evidence was found for the treatment of these conditions. One small study found that 0.025% clobetasol propionate (a very potent topical steroid) administered as a spray significantly reduced pain when compared to ointment. In another study, a significant difference in pain was seen in the small subgroup of 11 ELP participants, favouring ciclosporin solution over 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide in orabase (a potent topical steroid). In a study involving 45 ELP participants, aloe vera gel was 6 times more likely to result in at least a 50% improvement in pain symptoms compared to placebo. In a study involving a small subgroup of 8 ELP participants, a significant difference was seen for an improvement in the severity of the disease in favour of the ciclosporin group when compared to the vehicle.
Several side-effects were reported, but none were serious. With topical corticosteroids, the main side-effects were oral candida (yeast) infection and pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen. Temporary burning was a common side-effect reported with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment and pimecrolimus 0.1% cream.
Overall, there was no overwhelming evidence for the effectiveness of any single treatment, including topical steroids, which are the widely accepted first-line therapy for ELP. This was mainly due to the lack of good-quality, well-conducted trials and small participant numbers. Another Cochrane review has already assessed interventions for lichen planus affecting the mouth.
This review identified three randomized controlled trials involving 104 patients. Two studies compared progressive resistance training with standard care (usual treatment process). When we combined their results we found that progressive resistance training improved shoulder pain, shoulder disability, active range of motion for external rotation, passive range of motion for abduction, forward flexion, external rotation and horizontal abduction. The size of this improvement was small. The studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in quality of life. Two non-serious adverse events were reported in the progressive resistance training group and none in the standard care group.
Another study compared a broad spectrum of techniques, including free active exercises, stretching, postural care, re-education of scapulothoracic postural muscles, and strength of shoulder muscles, with routine postoperative physiotherapy care for three months following surgery. This study did not demonstrate a difference between the exercise group and the routine physiotherapy care group in shoulder function or quality of life. No adverse effects were reported.
Further studies which apply other exercise interventions in head and neck cancer patients in the early postoperative period and after radiotherapy are needed, with long-term follow-up.
We found 29 studies involving 2210 people with asthma. Studies lasted between 2 and 26 weeks. Studies reported inhaler technique on a range of different checklists.
We grouped studies into three types: studies testing enhanced face-to-face training session(s), studies using multi-media to deliver inhaler training (e.g. a video, computer app or game) and studies testing devices that give people visual or audio feedback about technique.
Studies tested different types of training and used different measures to gauge success, meaning that we could not bring data together. This was particularly true when we tried to assess effects on asthma attacks, adverse events, visits to a healthcare provider and absences from work or school. Both face-to-face and multi-media inhaler training improved inhaler technique in most studies, although results varied depending on how and when each technique was assessed.
Some studies reported the number of people who had correct or 'good enough' technique. More people had correct or 'good enough' technique after face-to-face training and with feedback devices. But the benefit of multi-media training for adults was uncertain.
Interventions that provide inhaler training may bring some benefit for quality of life and asthma control among adults and children, but results were varied and studies were small.
Children may receive some benefit but results tended to be less clear for children because fewer and smaller studies have included children as participants. For studies like these, it is not possible to blind people to their assigned group. This may bias how people behave or respond to questionnaires, which reduced our confidence in the findings. We were uncertain about other results because studies did not provide enough data to show clear benefit. We cannot say for sure what is the best way to help people learn how to use their inhaler properly. It is important that patients understand how their inhaler works, so they should ask their doctor or nurse for help.
We also use Cochrane Reviews to make suggestions for future research. We suggest that trials should last longer than six months and should report adherence information. The most useful information reported was the number of people who had 'good enough' inhaler technique, so we urge future trials to report this as well.
Guidelines for the treatment of asthma recommend that patients be educated about their condition, obtain regular medical review, monitor their condition at home with either peak flow or symptoms and use a written action plan. The results of trials comparing asthma self-management education to usual care were combined. These results showed that asthma sufferers who were educated about their asthma, visited the doctor regularly and who used a written action plan had fewer visits to the emergency room; less hospital admissions; better lung function; improvement in peak expiratory flow; fewer symptoms; and used less rescue medication.
We included nine studies in this review which involved 134 participants with TBI. Only five studies, including 105 people provided usable results. These studies tested the effects of a range of treatments, including medicines (baclofen or botulinum toxin A), casting, physiotherapy, splints, a table that moves people from the lying position to standing and electrical stimulation (where electrical impulses are delivered to the muscles). Studies inadequately reporting results had tested the effect of medicines (baclofen or tizanidine). Of the five studies with results, three were funded by governments, charities or health services and two were funded by a drug manufacturer and medical technology company. The other four studies without useable results were funded by drug manufacturer or medical technology companies. This evidence is current to June 2017.
Interpreting the results of the studies was difficult because of a lack of information and concerns about the quality of the evidence. For spasticity, some studies concluded that the treatment they tested made an improvement, and others found no difference between treatments. The most common side effect was minor skin damage in people who received casting. We believe it would be misleading to provide any further description of study results given the quality of the evidence was very low for all measurements. The quality of this evidence was very low; we only had five studies with results and none of the studies were large or comparable with one another. We also had concerns about how they were conducted or analysed. Because of this, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the benefits and harms of different treatments for spasticity in people with TBI.
Eight trials were found, which included around 1100 people, although information was only available for 1036 women. There was not enough evidence to determine whether the urodynamic tests led to better outcomes. There was some evidence that urodynamic testing increased the number of people given drugs but not the number of people undergoing surgery. This did not result in any difference in the number of people who leaked urine, and it was not known whether they had a better quality of life.
More research is needed in which people are randomised to having treatment decisions based on either their symptoms and examination alone or after taking into account the extra information provided by urodynamic tests.
The review found that there was not enough evidence to reach clear conclusions about the effects on any of these outcomes and it is therefore not clear to what extent the application of mistletoe extracts translates into improved symptom control, enhanced tumour response or prolonged survival. Adverse effects of mistletoe extracts were reported, but appeared to be dose-dependent and primarily confined to reactions at injection site and mild, transient flu-like symptoms. In the absence of good quality, independent trials, decisions about whether mistletoe extracts are likely to be beneficial for a particular problem should rely on expert judgement and practical considerations.
For this update of a previous Cochrane review, we reviewed the available evidence up to January 2015 for or against feverfew in the prevention of migraine and found six studies including 561 participants. Generally the studies were heterogeneous and their results were mixed. The previous version of this review showed no clear benefit of feverfew compared with placebo. We added a new study, which is larger and was carried out to high standards, to this review. It showed that feverfew reduced migraine frequency by a little more than half a migraine (0.6) per month compared to placebo. There was no difference in how severe the pain was, or how long it lasted. These results come from a single study of moderate size, therefore they must be viewed with caution until they are confirmed in other rigorous studies. No major adverse effects were associated with feverfew in the included studies.
Evidence in this review is current to July 2019. We included two randomised controlled trials (where participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either treatment) including 1674 adult participants who had one or more risk factors for developing CVD, which compared NP-guided treatment with standard care. We excluded patients with symptoms of heart failure. The mean age of participants varied between 64.1 and 67.8 years. Patients were followed-up for between 2 years and a mean of 4.2 years. Effects of NP-guided treatment on death due to CVD or for any other reason remain uncertain as our results were imprecise. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that NP-guided treatment probably reduces the number of hospitalisations due to cardiovascular events and due to all causes in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. We would expect that of 1000 patients who received standard care, 163 would be admitted to hospital as the result of a cardiovascular event, compared to between 65 and 111 patients who received NP-guided treatment. Out of 1000 patients with cardiovascular risk factors who received standard care, 601 would be admitted to hospital for any reason, compared to between 457 and 553 patients who received NP-guided treatment.
High-quality evidence indicates that NP-guided treatment reduces the risk of ventricular dysfunction (a condition that often leads to heart failure) compared to standard care. Our results suggest that of 1000 patients with cardiovascular risk factors who received standard care, 87 would develop ventricular dysfunction, compared to between 36 and 79 patients who received NP-guided treatment. No evidence suggests that NP-guided treatment affected NP level at completion of the studies. The quality of evidence ranged from low to high across outcomes. Key reasons for concern about the quality of the evidence included risk of bias, as patients and medical staff caring for patients knew whether they were in the control or intervention group and this may have affected the care they received; some results obtained were imprecise, and it is unclear if the intervention was beneficial or harmful. As we identified only two studies that were suitable for inclusion in this review, the generalisability of the review is limited.
We searched for as many relevant studies as we could find that had a reliable design (randomised controlled trials) and had compared memantine with placebo for each type of dementia. We found 44 studies involving about 10,000 people. Most studies (29 in 7885 people) were in people with AD. Most studies were well conducted, but some were not well reported and we got extra information from the drug companies. We analysed the results separately for people with mild dementia and those with moderate-to-severe dementia. Memantine has a small beneficial effect in people with moderate-to-severe AD. This benefit affects thinking, the ability to carry on normal daily activities, and the severity of behaviour and mood problems. Overall, it is well tolerated in those with moderate--to-severe AD, but it may cause dizziness in a few of the people taking it.
An important result is that adding memantine to established ChEI treatment also results in less deterioration than placebo.
However, in people with mild AD, memantine is probably no better than placebo. This is mainly moderate-quality evidence.
In vascular dementia, two studies in about 750 people indicated there is probably a small benefit for thinking difficulties, behaviour and mood, and there may be less agitation for memantine compared with placebo. This is moderate- or low-quality evidence. Overall, the evidence on memantine for AD is high quality, and comes from many trials in thousands of people. We can be confident in the findings for AD, but less so in people with other types of dementia.
This plain language summary is up to date as of March 2018.
This review of the evidence from one randomised controlled trial suggests there might be less short-term lung injury from high frequency oscillatory ventilation. However, more babies in this group developed haemorrhage in and around the fluid spaces in the brain (cerebral ventricles) and this harm might outweigh any benefit. More information is needed to clarify the balance between benefits and harms of high frequency oscillatory ventilation instead of conventional positive pressure ventilation for preterm infants with severe lung disease.
There are two techniques for gaining access to the bile duct during ERCP. The traditional technique (contrast) involves inserting a catheter into the papilla and injecting contrast dye to confirm access to the bile duct. However, contrast dye may be unintentionally injected into the pancreatic duct. A second technique (guidewire) involves using a guidewire to probe the papilla to gain access to the bile duct. Once an x-ray confirms the guidewire is in the bile duct, contrast dye is injected into the bile duct.
We wanted to find out:
• which technique for gaining access to the bile duct during ERCP works best to reduce the risk of PEP;
• which technique achieves better success in gaining access to the bile duct; and
• which technique causes fewer unwanted effects (for example, the need to use advanced techniques involving blind incision into the papilla to gain access to the bile duct, inadvertent entry of the pancreatic duct, bleeding, hole in the bowel wall, and death). We searched for studies that compared the guidewire to the contrast technique in people undergoing ERCP for biliary or pancreatic diseases. We compared and summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 15 studies that involved 4426 people undergoing ERCP. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world. The biggest study was in 513 people, and the smallest study was in 88 people, with ages ranging from 18 to 96 years and roughly equal numbers of men and women. Nine studies declared no funding sources and conflicts of interest, while the other six studies did not report this information. Compared to the contrast technique, using the guidewire technique probably reduces the risk of PEP and may increase the success rate of gaining access to the bile duct, and probably reduces the need to use advanced techniques to gain access to the bile duct. The guidewire technique may result in little to no difference in the risks of bleeding and hole in the bowel wall. There were no cases of procedure-related death. We are moderately confident that the guidewire technique reduces the risk of PEP and reduces the need to use advanced techniques to gain access to the bile duct, but it is possible that physicians who performed the ERCP and assessed the outcomes may be biased, as they were aware of which technique(s) they used during the procedures. We are less confident in the results for the success rate of gaining access to the bile duct, and the results of further research could differ from ours. We are also less confident in our results for the risks of bleeding and hole in the bowel wall because of the low number of reported events. We are moderately confident in our results for mortality due to no events reported in a large number of people. This review updates our previous review published in 2012. The evidence is up-to-date to February 2021.
There was evidence of a beneficial effect that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) improve PTSD symptoms compared to placebo, based on moderate-certainty evidence. There was also evidence of a benefit for the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) mirtazapine and the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) amitriptyline, in improving PTSD symptoms, based on low-certainty evidence. We also found no evidence of benefit for the number of participants who improved following treatment with the antipsychotic group compared to placebo, based on very low-certainty evidence. For the remaining medication classes, we did not observe evidence of a benefit for improving PTSD symptoms.
There was evidence of a harm that more people taking individual SSRI agents dropped out due to side effects than did those taking placebo, but absolute withdrawal rates were low for the SSRI groups. Most evidence for pharmacotherapy efficacy is related to SSRIs for acute treatment. There is an ongoing need to develop new pharmacotherapeutic treatments of PTSD.
We searched the literature on 6 July 2020, and we found four trials that included 232 participants with AAA who were on a waiting list for AAA surgery. The trials randomly assigned participants into two groups, one with exercise before surgery and another with usual care (no exercise before surgery, participants maintained normal physical activity). The types of exercise included circuit training, moderate-intensity continuous exercise and high-intensity interval training. In three of the four trials, the participants in the exercise group were supervised by healthcare professionals in hospital when they did their exercise sessions. In the other trial, the first exercise session was supervised in hospital, and the following sessions were completed by the participants on their own in their own homes. The number and length of the exercise sessions was different in the trials. Some exercise sessions took place three times a week and some took place six times a week. In some trials participants exercised for one week and some trials' participants exercised for six weeks before their surgery.
Limited information from a small number of trials showed that exercise before AAA surgery might slightly reduce heart and kidney complications after surgery, compared to no exercise (usual care) before AAA surgery. We are uncertain whether exercise before AAA surgery reduces death within 30 days of AAA surgery, lung complications, the need for further treatment or bleeding after surgery, compared to no exercise before AAA surgery. There was little or no difference between the exercise and usual care groups in length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay and quality of life. None of the studies reported information for the number of days participants were on a ventilator and change in AAA size before and after exercise. The certainty of the evidence is low or very low because of the way the studies were designed (risk of bias), and small number of people in the trials. Larger, well-designed trials are needed in order to increase our confidence in any benefits of exercising before AAA surgery for reducing complications.
In this review we looked at the effectiveness of injections of small amounts of sterile water given into four spots on the woman’s lower back in labour. The review included seven studies with 766 participants; four used intracutaneous injections, two subcutaneous, and one both. All studies compared the injections of sterile water with injections of saline, whilst none compared the injection of sterile water with women using their own skills to manage pain in labour. Nor did the studies compare with other forms of pain management in labour, as this information is in other Cochrane reviews.
We found no good quality evidence that these simple water injections could provide a significant level of pain relief compared with simple saline injection for any type of pain experienced during labour. Women did report transient pain at the injection site. More research is needed on this possible form of pain management in labour.
This review of the research on the effect of an antidepressant drug called paroxetine was conducted to shed light on the field of drug treatment for depression. In September 2012 we searched, in a wide ranging way, for all the useful studies (randomised controlled trials) which had been completed which compared paroxetine with any other antidepressant in treating people with depression. One hundred and fifteen studies were included in this review, with a total of 26,134 people. We grouped the studies according to the types of drug they compared paroxetine against; we then analysed the combined findings of these groups of studies.
For the primary outcome (number of people who responded to treatment) paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine, but less effective than mirtazapine (in the early phase: one to four weeks follow-up) and probably citalopram (at endpoint: six weeks follow-up). There was some evidence that paroxetine is less well tolerated than agomelatine and St John's Wort, as more patients allocated to paroxetine experienced at least some side effects (though this finding for St John's Wort was only based on one study).
In conclusion, some possibly meaningful differences between paroxetine and other antidepressants exist, but no definitive concluions can be drawn due to the limited number of studies per comparison. In addition, most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry, which means they might potentially have overestimated the effect of paroxetine. Therefore, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.
We searched electronic databases and identified randomized controlled trials (in which participants are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) consisting of participants who received high-pressure oxygen therapy or room air or no treatment as a control.
The evidence is current up to December 2015. We found a single, small study of 60 children that evaluated high-pressure oxygen therapy for ASD.
There was no evidence that high-pressure oxygen therapy improved social interaction, behavioral problems, speech or language communication, or mental function in children with ASD. However, children who received high-pressure (hyperbaric) oxygen therapy showed an increased occurrence of ear barotrauma events when compared with those in the control group. The quality of the evidence is low. Evidence is insufficient to confirm that high-pressure oxygen is an effective treatment for individuals with ASD.
The evidence is current to 19 January 2015. We included 34 randomised studies in this updated review, with 5121 pregnant women, aged 16 to 45 years. Women were from 12 to 38 weeks’ pregnant. Studies looked at different treatments for pregnant women with low-back pain, pelvic pain or both types of pain. All treatments were added to usual prenatal care, and were compared with usual prenatal care alone in 23 studies. Studies measured women's symptoms in different ways, ranging from self-reported pain and sick leave to the results of specific tests.  When we combined the results from seven studies (645 women) that compared any land-based exercise with usual prenatal care, exercise interventions (lasting from five to 20 weeks) improved women's levels of low-back pain and disability. There is less evidence available on treatments for pelvic pain. Two studies found that women who participated in group exercise and received information about managing their pain reported no difference in their pelvic pain than women who received usual prenatal care. The results of four studies combined (1176 women) showed that an eight- to 12-week exercise program reduced the number of women who reported low-back and pelvic pain. Land-based exercise, in a variety of formats, also reduced low-back and pelvic pain-related sick leave in two studies (1062 women).
However, two other studies (374 women) found that group exercise plus information was no better at preventing either pelvic or low-back pain than usual prenatal care.
There were a number of single studies that tested a variety of treatments. Findings suggested that craniosacral therapy, osteomanipulative therapy or a multi-modal intervention (manual therapy, exercise and education) may be of benefit.
When reported, there were no lasting side effects in any of the studies. There is low-quality evidence suggesting that exercise improves pain and disability for women with low-back pain, and moderate-quality evidence that exercise results in less sick leave and fewer women reporting pain in those with both low-back and pelvic pain together. The quality of evidence is due to problems with the design of studies, small numbers of women and varied results. As a result, we believe that future studies are very likely to change our conclusions. There is simply not enough good quality evidence to make confident decisions about treatments for these complaints.
We identified three trials that compared the efficacy of laparoscopic surgery and open surgery. These studies included 392 participants (195 in the laparoscopic group vs 197 in the open surgery group). The method used to allocate participants based on randomisation, that is, the choice of treatment that participants received, was determined by a method similar to coin tossing, so the two groups were as similar as possible. We found that laparoscopic surgical resection may lead to little or no difference in mean hospital stay when compared with open surgical resection. Operating time was longer in the laparoscopic group by an average of 49 minutes. No important differences were observed in terms of 30-day postoperative mortality, early overall morbidity, major and minor complications, surgical complications, postoperative times to liquid and solid diets, and reoperations due to anastomotic leak. To assess quality of life, researchers used different scales at different periods of time. Although one trial reported that patients who received laparoscopic surgery had better quality of life, the other two trials showed no benefit favouring either laparoscopic surgery or open surgery. The quality of the evidence varied from low to very low owing to risk of bias (i.e. conclusions may overestimate benefits or underestimate harms because of biased study design and conduct) and limitations in the patient population sample. Well-designed trials are necessary to obtain a more accurate estimate of the benefits and safety of laparoscopic surgery over open surgery.
We included 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) because they provide the most reliable evidence, with 1917 participants in total, from all around the world that investigated the use of oral olanzapine in treating or preventing nausea and vomiting.
All the included studies used olanzapine in combination with other medications, usually antiemetics (antisickness medications). Nine studies compared olanzapine to placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect) or no treatment. Other studies compared olanzapine to other antiemetics. Thirteen RCTs included participants receiving chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is graded according to how likely it is to provoke nausea and vomiting (i.e. how emetogenic it is). In six RCTs participants received highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). In six RCTs participants only received HEC. One RCT did not state whether participants received HEC or MEC.
No RCTs included participants receiving radiotherapy alone. One trial included participants who were receiving both chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment for their cancer. One trial included participants who were not receiving either chemotherapy or radiotherapy. No included RCTs reported receiving funds from pharmaceutical companies. Five studies stated that they had received funding from cancer foundations, endowments, or universities. Nine studies made no declaration regarding funding. Fifty percent of people who received olanzapine as well as standard treatment probably would not be nauseous or vomit during chemotherapy compared to just 25% of those who received standard treatment. Olanzapine probably makes unwanted sleepiness more likely. We are uncertain if using 5 mg olanzapine a day instead of 10 mg olanzapine a day reduces the likelihood of being sleepy without reducing the antisickness benefit. We are not certain about the risk of experiencing other side effects or serious side effects, so it is important to be aware that these might happen. There was some suggestion that people who take olanzapine with standard treatment might have an improved quality of life compared to those who used standard treatment alone, but we were very uncertain of this because we were unable to analyse the data. There was not enough evidence to say whether people prefer to use olanzapine compared to not taking it.
There is not enough evidence to say whether olanzapine is as good as, worse or better than other antisickness medications currently in use. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. 'Very low-quality evidence' means that we are very uncertain about the results. 'High-quality evidence' means that we are very confident in the results. We found moderate-quality evidence that olanzapine reduces overall nausea and vomiting but that it also increases unwanted sleepiness when compared to placebo or no treatment. There was moderate-quality evidence for patient preference and low-quality evidence for adverse events. The remaining evidence was of low- or very-low quality. Olanzapine is probably an effective antisickness medication. We are unsure which dose is best to use, 5 mg or 10 mg, or if 2.5 mg might work just as well. However, this review only found information about giving olanzapine by mouth and did not find any about injecting it. More research is needed to inform practice.
The researchers searched the medical literature up to March 2014, and identified 33 medical studies that investigated the use of tissue adhesives for closure of wounds. They compared tissue adhesive with another method of closure such as sutures, staples, tape, or another type of tissue adhesive. The main outcomes of interest were whether wounds stayed closed - and did not break down - and whether they became infected. The results of the review showed clearly that fewer wounds broke down when sutures were used. Studies also reported that some types of tissue adhesives might be slightly quicker to use than other types. There was no clear difference between tissue adhesives and the alternative closure methods for cosmetic results or costs. Results regarding surgeons' and patients' preferred skin closure method were mixed.
There were seven studies included in the review (793 participants). Three of these compared UAE with hysterectomy, two studies compared UAE with myomectomy, and another two with hysterectomy or myomectomy. The studies differed in their outcomes and length of follow-up. With regard to patient satisfaction rates, our findings were consistent with satisfaction rates being up to 41% lower or up to 48% higher with UAE compared to surgery within 24 months of having the procedure. Findings on satisfaction rates were also inconclusive at five years of follow-up.
There was very low quality evidence to suggest that fertility outcomes (live birth and pregnancy) may be better after myomectomy than after UAE, but this evidence was based on a small selected subgroup and should be regarded with extreme caution. The UAE group had a shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to daily activities. With regards to safety, the evidence on major complications was inconclusive and consistent with benefit or harm, or no difference, from either intervention. However, the risk of minor complications was higher after UAE. Moreover, there was a higher likelihood of needing another surgical intervention after UAE, at two year and at five year follow-up. If we assumed that 7% of women will require further surgery within two years of hysterectomy or myomectomy, between 15% and 32% will require further surgery within two years of UAE. Therefore, it appears that while UAE is a safe option with an earlier initial recovery, it does carry a higher risk of minor complications and the need for further surgery later on. The quality of the evidence varied from very low for live birth, to moderate for satisfaction ratings and for most safety outcomes. The main limitations in the evidence were serious imprecision, failure to clearly report methods, and lack of blinding for subjective outcomes.
This review included 11 studies with a total of 250 randomized participants with neuromuscular disease. Six studies included 112 young males (including children) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is an inherited muscle disease. One trial involved 23 adults with other muscle diseases (Becker muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy). Three trials involved 88 people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive condition that affects the nerves controlling movement. One trial involved 27 people with myasthenia gravis, a condition that affects the signals between nerves and muscles. The studies showed that respiratory muscle training may result in some improvements in lung function for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, this finding was not consistent between studies. Physical function and quality of life were only assessed in one amyotrophic lateral sclerosis trial, which indicated that RMT may have no clear effect. One trial reported on adverse events, but the certainty of evidence was too low for conclusions to be drawn. The studies did not report the number of unscheduled hospitalisations for sudden infection or worsening of chronic respiratory failure. The certainty of the evidence examined as part of this review was low or very low. Low-certainty evidence means that our confidence in the effect of respiratory muscle training is limited, and the true effect may be substantially different. When the evidence is of very low-certainty, the true effect is likely to be substantially different. Given the low or very low-certainty of the evidence presented in the studies, we believe that there is a need for more well-conducted studies in order to assess the efficacy of respiratory muscle training in people with NMD.
The evidence is current to November 2018.
Eight randomised controlled trials (702 women) were identified that compared withholding gonadotrophins (coasting) with another intervention to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The other interventions included no coasting, early unilateral follicular aspiration (taking follicles from one ovary 10 to 12 hours after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)), gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist (drugs that block the release of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and FSH co-trigger (extra dose of FSH given at the same time as the hCG). There was low-quality evidence to suggest that coasting reduced rates of moderate or severe OHSS more than no coasting. There was no evidence to suggest that coasting was more beneficial than other interventions, except that there was very low-quality evidence from a single small study to suggest that using FSH co-trigger at the time of HCG administration may be better at reducing the risk of OHSS than coasting. There were too few data to determine clearly whether there was a difference between the groups for any other outcomes. The quality of evidence was low or very low. The main limitations were failure to report live birth, risk of bias due to lack of information about study methods, and imprecision due to low event rates and lack of data. Four of the studies were published only as abstracts, and provided limited data.
We included three new trials (15,993 participants) for this update; the review now includes a total of 61 trials with 1,055,337 participants. All participants were aged 60 years or older, living in the community. Government health organisations funded 33 studies; foundations funded 9 studies; organisations that provided healthcare services in the studies funded 3 studies; and a pharmaceutical company offering free vaccines funded 1 study. Fifteen studies did not report any funding source. Increasing community demand for vaccination (12 strategies, 41 trials, 767,460 participants)
Effective interventions consisted of reminders/recalls using letters and leaflets, and nurses or pharmacists educating and nurses vaccinating patients. Individual effective studies consisted of client outreach by retired teachers, receptionists, nurses, and medical students.
It was not possible to combine some interventions for analysis as they were too varied: 17 studies of simple reminders (11 with significant results); 16 studies of personalised reminders (12 with significant results); two studies of customised letters versus form letters (both with significant results); and four studies of health risk appraisals plus vaccination recommendations (all with significant results).
Improving vaccination access (6 strategies, 8 trials, 9353 participants)
Effective interventions consisted of home visits, client group clinic visits, and free vaccine offers.
Improving provision by providers or the healthcare system (11 strategies, 15 trials, 278,524 participants)
Effective interventions that could be combined for analysis included physician payment, physician reminders, clinic posters encouraging physician competition, and chart reviews plus benchmarking to rates of the top 10% of physicians. We could not analyse some groups of interventions: physician reminders (four studies, two of which were effective) and facilitator vaccination encouragement (three studies, two of which were effective).
Individual studies that were not effective consisted of posters plus postcards versus posters alone, educational reminders to physicians compared to mailed educational materials, educational outreach plus feedback to teams versus written feedback, and increasing staff vaccination rates.
No studies measured if interventions reduced illness or hospital admissions or reported societal-level interventions. Overall, we assessed the included studies as at moderate risk of bias. The overall GRADE assessment of the evidence was high to moderate quality.
We searched for all research published up to 1 April 2014, finding 32 relevant studies. There were 19 studies on five anti-TNF biologics (adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab) and 12 studies on five non-anti-TNF biologics (abatacept, canakinumab, rituximab, tocilizumab and an anti-interferon gamma monoclonal antibody). Altogether 9,946 participants received biologics and 4,682 participants received standard therapy. All but two of the studies were randomised placebo-controlled trials, the gold standard in terms of study quality. We compared the effects of biologics versus placebo. In some studies, participants may have been taking standard therapy for rheumatoid arthritis at the start of the trial. In these studies, investigators added either biologics or placebo treatment to standard therapy. Overall, treatment by biologics led to small to moderate reductions (9 units reduction on a 0-52 scale) in patient-reported fatigue compared with 3 units in participants treated by placebo. It is unclear whether this improvement is due to a reduction in overall disease activity, a direct effect of the biologics or some other mechanism. There may have been some potential bias in the way investigators analysed data, and some studies did not include all randomised individuals, so we judged the quality of the evidence to be only moderate rather than high.
Carbamazepine was developed to treat epilepsy, but it is now used to treat various forms of chronic pain. We performed searches (up to February 2014) to look for clinical trials where carbamazepine was used to treat neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. We found 10 studies involving 418 people involved in testing carbamazepine. Studies were not generally of very good quality. Most were very small, as well as of short duration. Studies lasting only one or two weeks are unhelpful when pain can last for years.
There was not enough good quality evidence to say how well carbamazepine worked in any neuropathic pain condition. Pooling four small studies showed that it was better than placebo, but the result cannot be relied upon. There was not enough information from these studies to make any reliable comment on adverse events or harm.
Carbamazepine is probably helpful for some people with chronic neuropathic pain. It is not possible to know beforehand who will benefit and who will not.
The review of studies assessed the use of amniotomy in all labours that started spontaneously. There were 15 studies identified, involving 5583 women, none of which assessed whether amniotomy increased women's pain in labour. The evidence showed no shortening of the length of first stage of labour and a possible increase in caesarean section. Routine amniotomy is not recommended as part of standard labour management and care.
This review is based on five studies involving 1065 women undergoing CS. The studies were of moderate quality. The included studies did not use this review's criteria for diagnosis for UTI, so there are no data for this primary outcome. When considering UTI, as defined by the trial authors, there were no clear differences between groups. There were no data relating to bladder injury during the CS (the review's other primary outcome).
Our analysis showed that the use of urinary catheter was associated with less retention of urine after CS. On the other hand, pain/discomfort due to catheterisation or at first voiding after CS, time to ambulate and hospital stay favoured non-use of urinary catheter. There was no difference in the incidence of uterine bleeding due to uterine atony (relaxation of the uterus) after the delivery.
The limited evidence in this review is based five trials of moderate quality and results should be considered in this context. There is not enough evidence to assess the routine use of indwelling bladder catheters in women undergoing CS. There is a need for more rigorous research on this topic and future trials should use a standardised criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and other common outcomes.
We wanted to find out if breastfeeding support interventions targeting depression were better than standard postpartum care for preventing postpartum depression and reducing symptoms of postpartum depression. We also wanted to find out if breastfeeding support interventions had any harmful side effects. In June 2024, we performed a literature review of randomised controlled trials (studies where participants were allocated into either an intervention or control group by chance) to see if breastfeeding support interventions could prevent postpartum depression. Our review includes 10 studies, of which nine evaluated mothers receiving psychosocial support (a mix of education, psychological help and social support) and one evaluated an intervention to reduce stress and promote relaxation. In total, the 10 studies included 1573 participants and were conducted in six different countries: two in the US, two in Canada, three in China, one in Iran, one in Spain and one in South Africa.
We were interested to find out whether breastfeeding interventions could prevent depression from developing or reduce symptoms of depression, and whether there were any harmful side effects. We were also interested to find out whether breastfeeding interventions could impact anxiety and stress in the mother, how long mothers breastfed for and how satisfied they were with breastfeeding, as well as how many babies were fed only with breast milk. We included 10 studies involving 1573 mothers in this review. Nine of the studies tested psychosocial breastfeeding interventions and one tested an alterative breastfeeding intervention.
Psychosocial breastfeeding support interventions may prevent some cases of postpartum depression when measured shortly after the support is provided. However, it is very uncertain whether psychosocial breastfeeding interventions have any effect on reducing depressive symptoms.
Psychosocial breastfeeding support interventions may reduce symptoms of anxiety, though the evidence is very uncertain. We found no difference between mothers who did and did not receive breastfeeding support interventions in terms of whether they fed their babies breast milk exclusively (as is recommended up to six months). The evidence for this outcome is also very uncertain. We found low-certainty evidence that psychosocial breastfeeding interventions may increase the duration of breastfeeding in the long term. The studies of psychosocial breastfeeding interventions did not measure stress.
It is very uncertain whether alternative breastfeeding support interventions, specifically mindfulness, have any effect on preventing depression or reducing anxiety or stress. Breastfeeding exclusivity and duration were not measured.
No harmful effects connected to any of the interventions were reported. For most studies, we do not know if this is because there were none or because they were not measured or reported. The evidence for breastfeeding support interventions to prevent postpartum depression is limited. The finding that psychosocial breastfeeding support interventions may prevent some cases of postpartum depression shortly after the support is provided is from one small study. We considered this finding to be 'low certainty'. The evidence that breastfeeding support interventions may increase the duration of breastfeeding is also from one study and of 'low certainty'. For all other outcomes, the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is based on searches for studies carried out in June 2024.
We included empirical studies of collections of systematic reviews that assessed methods for measuring effects on health inequalities. We define health inequalities as unfair and avoidable differences across socially stratifying factors that limit opportunities for health. We evaluated differences in health across any component of the PROGRESS-Plus acronym, which stands for Place of residence, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Occupation, Gender or sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital. "Plus" stands for other factors associated with discrimination, exclusion, marginalisation or vulnerability such as personal characteristics (e.g. age, disability), relationships that limit opportunities for health (e.g. children in a household with smoking parents) or environmental situations which provide limited control of opportunities for health (e.g. school, food, environment). This updated review includes 158 collections of systematic reviews: 108 focused on evidence relevant to populations experiencing inequity, 26 assessed subgroup analysis across PROGRESS-Plus, two assessed analysis of a gradient in effect across PROGRESS-Plus and 20 used a combination of subgroup analysis and focused approaches. The most common PROGRESS-Plus factors assessed were age (43 studies), socioeconomic status (35 studies), low- and middle-income countries (24 studies). Four studies assessed multiple factors across which health inequity may exist.
We identified five methodological approaches to consider health equity in systematic reviews of effectiveness: 1) descriptive assessment in the reviews, 2) descriptive assessment of the studies included in the reviews, 3) analytic approaches, 4) applicability assessment, and 5) stakeholder engagement. However, the most appropriate way to address any of these approaches is unclear. Analysis of effects for specific populations need to be justified and reported appropriately to allow assessment of their credibility. Transparency of judgments about applicability and relevance to disadvantaged populations needs to be improved. Guidance on equity and specific populations is available in the Cochrane Handbook. The evidence is up to date to February 2021.

We performed this systematic review to investigate the beneficial and harmful effects of weight reduction with different measures for NAFLD patients, but we could not find firm evidence. Five trials on lifestyle programme and two trials on orlistat were obtained, and all but one had high risk of bias. There seemed to be some beneficial effects of lifestyle programme involving restricted diet and physical exercise for NAFLD patients. However, the data were sparse, and meta-analyses could not be performed. Well-designed randomised clinical trials are needed to establish the true effect of the weight reduction measures identified for our review. The long-term prognosis of development of fibrosis, mortality, and quality of life modified by weight reduction should be studied. Special attention should be paid to the amount of weight loss.
This review is up-to-date to May 2014. We included 26 trials involving 17,011 participants: 24 trials assessed lowering blood pressure, one trial tested raising blood pressure, and two trials assessed what to do with drugs taken before stroke. All studies took place in hospitals that were used to treating people with stroke. Not all trials contributed information to all outcomes, and we have used data that were available in publications. There is insufficient evidence to say that lowering blood pressure saves lives or reduces disability in people with acute stroke. Immediately restarting blood pressure-lowering drugs taken before the stroke may increase disability. More research is needed to identify those people who are most likely to benefit from altering blood pressure in acute stroke, the time window in which the treatment is likely to be of benefit, what types of stroke are likely to respond favourably, and the environment in which such treatment may be best given in routine practice.
This systematic review was conducted to assess how street lighting affects the occurrence of road traffic crashes and associated injuries. The authors searched for all controlled trials comparing the effects of new street lighting with unlit roads, or improved street lighting with the pre-existing lighting level. They found 17 controlled before-after studies, all of which were conducted in high-income countries. Twelve studies investigated the effects of newly installed street lighting, four the effects of improved lighting and one investigated both new and improved lighting. Five of the studies compared the effects of street lighting with a separate area control, while the remaining 12 used data from a day-time control. The authors were able to pool crash or injury data from 15 of the studies. The risk of bias in these studies was judged to be high.
The results indicate that street lighting can prevent road traffic crashes, injuries and fatalities. This finding might be of particular interest to low and middle-income countries where the policy on street lighting is less developed and the installation of suitable lighting systems is less common than in high-income countries. However, further well designed studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of street lighting in middle and low-income countries.
This review included 11 trials of cognitive training and a single trial of cognitive rehabilitation. We found no evidence for the efficacy of cognitive training in improving cognitive functioning, mood or activities of daily living in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia; however the quality of the studies was generally not high. The single trial of cognitive rehabilitation provided preliminary indications of the potential benefits of individual cognitive rehabilitation in improving activities of daily living in people with mild Alzheimer's disease. More high-quality trials of both cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are needed to establish their efficacy for people with early-stage dementia.
We wanted to know which surgical treatments are most likely to result in people with mouth and throat cancers living longer (overall survival), living longer without symptoms (disease-free survival), and not having the cancer come back at the same site (locoregional recurrence) or spread to other sites (recurrence). We also wanted to know if the different treatments have unwanted effects. We searched for studies that randomly allocated people with mouth or throat cancer to different types of surgical treatment. We summarised the characteristics and findings of relevant studies and assessed our confidence in the results. We included 15 studies (four new studies in this update) that evaluated nine comparisons of different treatments. No studies compared different approaches to cutting out the original (primary) tumour. The studies involved 2820 participants. Five studies evaluated removal of the primary tumour, comparing elective neck dissection with the 'watch and wait approach' in people with mouth cancer. The results show that elective neck dissection probably leads to longer overall and disease-free survival and less locoregional recurrence, but more unwanted effects.
Two studies compared radical neck dissection versus selective neck dissection in people with mouth cancer. It is unclear which treatment provides better outcomes.
Two trials evaluated a more limited neck dissection (superselective) versus selective neck dissection; we were unable to use the data reported.
One study compared a more selective neck dissection (supraomohyoid) and a modified radical neck dissection. We were unable to use the data reported. The modified radical neck dissection group had more complications, more pain, and poorer shoulder function, but we are very uncertain about the results.
In one study, all the people in one group had a lymph node biopsy and only had neck lymph nodes removed if the biopsy was positive, while all people in the other group had neck lymph nodes removed without a biopsy. There may be no difference between these two approaches in terms of overall survival, disease-free survival, and locoregional recurrence. No unwanted effects were reported.
One study evaluated using a special scan (positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT)) after combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy to guide decisions about neck dissection, versus a planned neck dissection before or after chemoradiotherapy. There is probably no difference between these approaches in terms of overall survival or locoregional recurrence. There may be no difference in unwanted effects, but we are very uncertain about the results.
One trial suggested that surgery plus radiotherapy may result in better overall survival than radiotherapy alone, but we are very uncertain about the results. Surgery may result in more thickened scar tissue. There may be no difference with regard to other unwanted effects.
One study compared surgery versus radiotherapy in people with throat cancer. There may be no difference in overall survival, disease-free survival, or unwanted effects, but we are very uncertain about the results.
One study compared surgery followed by radiotherapy versus chemotherapy. People receiving surgery and radiotherapy may live longer without symptoms, but we are very uncertain about the results. We are moderately confident that elective neck dissection at the same time as removal of the main tumour improves survival and reduces recurrence. Not all studies provided information about everything that we were interested in.
We are moderately confident that PET-CT does not improve survival or reduce recurrence. There are too few studies to be certain about the results.
We have little confidence in results from other comparisons due to too few studies and limited information within them. The evidence is current to 9 February 2022.
We reviewed the trials that compared giving MAO-B inhibitors with other types of medication in people with early Parkinson's to see if there was good evidence that MAO-B inhibitors were the best treatment to offer. However, unfortunately we only identified two trials (593 patients) so there was only limited evidence. The results showed that MAO-B inhibitors were less good at improving the symptoms of Parkinson's than either levodopa or dopamine agonists but that they may reduce motor fluctuations compared with levodopa, though not compared with dopamine agonists. MAO-B inhibitors did, however, have fewer major side effects than some dopamine agonists.
Our review included two randomised controlled trials (involving 154 women) comparing surgical repair of first-degree (involving only the perineal or vaginal skin) or second-degree tears (also involving muscle) with leaving the wound to heal spontaneously. These trials showed no clear differences in clinical outcomes between the groups. The studies did not find any differences in pain immediately and up to eight weeks postpartum. One of the trials reported no difference in wounds complications, but the other showed differences in wound closure and poor wound approximation in the non-sutured group. There was no information about the effect on long-term outcomes such as sexual discomfort or incontinence. More research is needed to provide a strong evidence-based recommendation for clinical practice.
We included four studies with a total of 209 patients, ranging in age from 23 to 85 and with more men than women. All the studies allowed the use of hearing aids for a total period of at least eight weeks before questions were asked about their preference for one or two aids. In all the studies the patients had bilateral hearing loss but there was considerable variation in what type of hearing loss they suffered from and how bad their hearing was.
Three of the studies were published before the mid-1990s and the fourth study was published in 2011. Therefore, only the most recent study used 'modern' hearing aids similar to those that are widely available in high-income countries. Of the four studies, two were conducted in the UK in National Health Service (NHS – public sector) patients. One of these looked at patients from primary care whose hearing loss had been picked up by a screening programme. The other looked at patients whose primary care practitioner thought they might benefit from hearing aids so had referred them to the local ENT department to get them. The other two studies were conducted in the United States: one study recruited only people on active military duty, or who had served in the military and had hearing loss due to being exposed to loud noises. About half of the people in the other study were ex-military. Only one of the outcomes we thought was most important - patient preference - was reported in all studies. The percentage of patients who preferred two hearing aids to one varied between studies: this was 54% (51 out of 94), 39% (22 out of 56), 55% (16 out of 29) and 77% (23 out of 30), respectively. We did not combine the numbers from these four studies because it would not have been right to do so. We graded the quality of evidence for this outcome as very low on a scale that goes high – medium – low – very low. There was no information in the four studies on the other outcomes we were interested in. This review identified only four studies comparing the use of one hearing aid with two. The studies were small and included people of widely varying ages. There was also considerable variation in the types of their deafness and in how deaf they were.
For the most part, the types of hearing aid evaluated would now be regarded, in high-income countries, as 'old technology', with only one study looking at 'modern' digital aids. However, we do not know if this is relevant or not. This review did not look at the differences between other 'old' and 'new' types of hearing aid.
We could not combine the numbers from the four studies. Overall, this fact and the very low quality of the evidence leads us to conclude that we do not know if patients have a preference for one aid or two. Similarly, we do not know if a patient's quality of life is better with one or two aids.
The review authors identified two controlled studies in which a total of 104 participants (68 male and 36 female) with intermittent claudication were randomised to receive the same type of endovascular stent (Palmaz) or balloon angioplasty alone. This review found that there is not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effects of using stents with angioplasty over angioplasty alone to treat intermittent claudication.
We were moderately certain regarding the data in adults, but less certain about the effects of adding formoterol to ICS in children. Given the low number of deaths that occurred in the studies, we do not yet have enough information to be able to measure accurately the risk of adding formoterol to ICS on number of deaths.
Almost all trials were sponsored by drug manufacturers.
Other concerns were that the cause of serious adverse events (i.e. whether they were judged by the trialists to be asthma-related or not) were not independently assessed, and it may have been possible to guess which treatment group the person experiencing the adverse event was from. Although the people in the trial did not know whether they had been given a dummy drug or the active treatment, formoterol has quite a large effect on symptoms. This meant that they might have been able to guess who was taking formoterol. It was not possible for us to tell whether this occurred or not, which is why we primarily look at the all-cause events, which do not require assessment of cause. We are not able to state confidently that adding formoterol to ICS carries no risk of increasing the number of deaths in comparison with ICS alone. On the other hand, we found no conclusive evidence of an increase in serious harm. Three asthma-related deaths occurred in a total of 12,777 adults treated with formoterol in combination with ICS. We found no conclusive evidence of risk of non-fatal serious harms attributed to asthma when formoterol was combined with ICS in adults.
This Plain language summary is current as of February 2019.
Several systematic reviews compared recombinant FSH with urinary gonadotrophins (HMG, purified FSH, highly purified FSH) for ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF and ICSI cycles and these reported conflicting results. We included 42 trials with in total 9606 couples. Comparing rFSH with urinary gonadotrophins overall did not result in any difference in live birth rate, OHSS or any of the other outcomes. Comparing rFSH with HMG/HP-HMG resulted in a significantly lower live birth rate in the rFSH group though differences were small. There was no proof of a difference in live birth when comparing rFSH with FSH-P or with FSH-HP. We may conclude that all these gonadotrophins are equally effective and safe, and that further trials are unwarranted.
However, randomized controlled trials showed different results in terms of prolongation of survival, reduction of infections and side effects of treatments. We conducted a systematic review assessing the role of administration of immunoglobulins from healthy donors as prophylaxis in patients with hematological malignancies. Our review showed that in the context of bone marrow transplantation the administration of immunoglobulins did not have an effect on survival or other outcomes. On the other hand, in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders like chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma, it reduced substantially the rate of infections. Despite their high cost, prophylactic immunoglobulins might prove cost-effective in this population.
For this update, databases of registered clinical trials and published trial reports were searched up until 10 November 2015 for any studies that tested the effects of coenzyme Q10 on patients' blood pressure. One new trial was found and one trial in the initial review was excluded. These studies measured the effects of coenzyme Q10 on blood pressure in non-hospitalized men and women who took the drugs for 8 to 12 weeks. One of the three trials was judged to have an unacceptably high risk of bias and was not included in the pooled analysis. The total number of patients studied in the two pooled trials was 50. Pooled data from two trials showed that coenzyme Q10 did not affect blood pressure compared to placebo. The number of patients stopping the drug due to adverse effects was also an outcome of interest. In one of the three included trials, coenzyme Q10 was well-tolerated and no adverse effects were reported. This review provides moderate-quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 does not lower blood pressure. However, more well-conducted studies are needed to be sure.
This review included 39 randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing abstinence-plus programs to various control groups (eg "usual care," no intervention). Although we conducted an extensive international search for trials, all included studies were conducted among youth in the US, Canada, and the Bahamas (total baseline enrolment=37724 participants). The included programs took place in schools, community centers, and healthcare facilities. We did not conduct a meta-analysis because of missing data and variation in program designs.
Using various control groups, 24 of 39 evaluations showed a significantly protective intervention effect on at least one biological or behavioral outcome at short-term, medium-term, or long-term follow-up. Eight trials found no evidence that abstinence-plus programs affect self-reported sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence and limited evidence that programs have a protective effect on self-reported pregnancy incidence. Results for behavioral outcomes were inconsistent across studies. Findings in almost every trial assessing HIV-related knowledge favored the intervention group over controls. No harms were observed for any outcome, including incidence and frequency of sexual activity.
Limitations for this review include underreporting of relevant outcomes, reliance on program participants to report their behaviors accurately, and methodological weaknesses in the trials.
We investigated whether IVF treatment leads to more live births than other treatments for unexplained subfertility. We included nine randomised controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) in the review. Some trials involved several comparisons. Two trials compared IVF with expectant management; two with IUI alone; and six with IUI plus stimulation of the ovaries. Scanty evidence meant that we were unable to draw any firm conclusions as to whether IVF may be associated with higher live birth rate (LBR) than trying naturally (expectant management). If we assume 4% LBR with expectant management, LBR with IVF would be between 8.8% and 9%.
IVF may lead to improved LBR compared to unstimulated IUI. If we assume LBR 16% with unstimulated IUI, LBR with IVF would be between 18.5% and 49%.
In women pretreated with IUI plus CC, IVF may lead to improved LBR compared with IUI plus gonadotropins. In women pretreated with IUI plus CC, if we assume 22% LBR with IUI plus gonadotropins, LBR with IVF would be between 39% and 65%.
In women never previously treated with IUI plus CC, LBR may be no better after one IVF cycle compared to two to three cycles of IUI plus gonadotropins; one IVF cycle compared to one IUI cycle plus gonadotropins; or IVF compared to IUI plus CC. If we assume 42% LBR with IUI plus gonadotropins (in one IVF to two to three IUI cycles), LBR would be between 39% and 54% with IVF; assuming 26% LBR with IUI plus gonadotropins (in one IVF to one IUI cycle), LBR would be between 24% and 51% with IVF. Assuming 15% LBR with IUI plus CC, LBR would be between 15% and 54% with IVF.
We were unable to examine complications associated with these treatments owing to lack of evidence. We have low confidence in the evidence because there were relatively few studies, with low numbers of participants. The evidence is current to November 2021.
We identified 14 studies that were suitable for analysis with a total of 511 participants; 92 were treated by wide resection compared to 419 by intralesional treatment. Age of the participants varied from 13 to 82 years with a mean age of 48 years. Women outnumbered men in the studies by just over one and a half times, which reflects that LGCS are more common in women. People were followed-up for between 24 to 300 months after surgery. In addition, there were four studies including 270 participants, from which we could not extract the exact data, but were used to confirm the statistical analysis. We found that there was little or no difference in rates of local recurrence between treatment types. In 94% to 96% of the cases, the tumour was successfully removed after a single operation. In the few cases where disease recurred, a second operation was needed. People with LGCS probably have better functionality after less aggressive intralesional treatment, and complication rates were probably lower compare to wide surgical resection. Less than 0.3% of all people with LGCS died due to their disease, irrespective of the surgical technique. Overall certainty of the studies was very low, as all studies only described the results of the treatment in hindsight and none of the studies randomly selected patients between treatment groups.
The review assessed whether antiviral drugs given to pregnant women with herpes before a recurrence might be effective in reducing transmission to the baby. Seven studies were identified involving 1249 women. Giving antiviral drugs reduces viral shedding and recurrences at labor and birth. They also reduced the use of cesarean, but there is no evidence of reduction in neonatal herpes. Women should also be informed that the risk of the baby getting herpes during birth is low.
We found four studies with 1644 participants. Two studies compared extensive cancer tests with tests carried out at the physician's discretion and two studies compared cancer tests plus scanning with cancer tests alone. Combining the results of the two studies showed that extensive testing had no effect on the number of cancer-related deaths. Additionally, extensive testing did not identify more people with cancer. However, extensive testing did identify cancers at an earlier stage (approximately 10 months earlier) and cancers were less advanced in people in the extensive testing group than in people in the group with tests carried out at the physician's discretion. Neither study looked at the number of deaths due to any cause, deaths and illness associated with VTE, side effects of cancer tests, side effects of VTE treatment or participant satisfaction. Two studies that compared tests plus scanning with tests alone showed that adding computed tomography scanning had little or no effect on the number of deaths, cancer-related deaths, illness associated with VTE; nor did it identify more people with cancer, or show a clear difference in time to diagnosis or stages of cancer diagnosed. Neither study looked at deaths associated with VTE, side effects of cancer tests, side effects of VTE treatment, participant satisfaction or quality of life. When comparing extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion, the certainty of the evidence was low due to bias caused by two of the studies stopping early. When comparing tests plus PET/CT scanning with tests alone, the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate due to issues with how the studies were designed, imprecision caused by a low number of events and bias due to lack of blinding of people assessing the effects. This Cochrane review updates our previous evidence. The evidence is current to May 2021.
This review included data from 17 trials with 1369 participants. Brushes with a rotation oscillation action reduced plaque and gingivitis more than those with a side to side action in the short term. However, the difference was small and it's clinical importance unclear. Due to the low numbers of trials using other types of powered brushes, no other definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the superiority of one type of powered toothbrush over another. Only minor and transient side effects were reported. Cost and reliability of the brushes were not reported in the trials.
Further trials of good quality are required to establish if other types of powered brush are better at reducing plaque and gingivitis.
In a search updated to January 2017, review authors identified 20 studies for inclusion in the review. Sixteen studies (977 infants) compared two separate groups of infants treated with a volume-targeted mode of ventilation compared with a pressure-limited mode of ventilation. In four studies (84 infants), the infants were treated with both modes of ventilation in a cross-over design (where infants had ventilation with one method and were then swapped over to the second method). Most of the studies were of moderate to low quality and none of them were blinded to those who assessed therapy. The most important results from this review were based on data from eight to 12 studies including 584 to 771 infants. Babies ventilated using volume-targeted modes of ventilation were more likely to survive free of lung damage. They needed ventilator assistance for a shorter duration and were less likely to develop pneumothorax (a condition when air escapes from the lung into the chest). They had more stable carbon dioxide levels in the blood, and had fewer brain ultrasound abnormalities. There was no evidence that volume-targeted modes were more likely to harm the infant than traditional pressure-limited modes. More research is needed to understand whether volume-targeted modes also lead to improvements in the development of movement and intellect. More research is also needed comparing different volume-targeting techniques. Low to moderate quality as none of the studies were blinded and there were issues with study design in some of the studies.
For people with focal onset seizures, we judged the quality of the evidence to be high for the outcomes of seizure recurrence and remission of seizures and we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate for the outcome of treatment failure. The design of the trials (specifically, whether the people and treating clinicians knew which medication they were taking) may have influenced the rates of withdrawal from treatments. Up to 50% of people in the trials used in our results may have been wrongly classified as having generalised seizures; for people with generalised onset seizures, we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate for the outcomes of seizure recurrence and remission of seizures and low quality for the outcome of treatment failure. For people with focal onset seizures, lamotrigine and carbamazepine are effective treatments and a choice between these two treatments must be made carefully. More information is needed for people with generalised onset seizures. We recommend that all future trials comparing these medications, or any other antiepileptic medications, should be designed using high-quality methods. Seizure types of people included in trials should also be classified very carefully to ensure that the results are also of high quality.
The evidence on which this review is based was up to date as of 17 June 2013. Six trials were included with a total of 1162 participants.
All six of these trials compared the use of antibiotics to prevent infection (failures and complications) with no treatment or treatment with a placebo (a fake medicine with no active ingredient). The antibiotic used in all the trials was amoxicillin; doses and timing of doses varied, although most used a single dose taken just before the implant was placed. One of the trials, with 100 participants, also looked at different doses of amoxicillin taken at different times.
There were no trials that looked at alternative antibiotics.
Participants were people over 18 years of age who were able to give consent to taking part in a medical trial. Potential participants were excluded for a variety of reasons that included: if they were at risk of heart disease, had artificial joints, had problems with their immune system, were affected by diabetes, had received radiotherapy in the head and neck area, had need of additional procedures at the time of implant placement, were allergic to penicillin, had chronic/acute infections near the planned implant site, were already receiving antibiotic treatment for any other reasons (or had taken them up to six months previously), had been treated with or were receiving intravenous amino-bisphosphonates, were pregnant or breast feeding, were receiving long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, or had blood clotting problems. The follow-up period in all the trials was at least three months. It appears that the oral administration of two grams of amoxicillin one hour before placement of dental implants is effective in reducing implant failures. More specifically, giving antibiotics to 25 people will avoid one person experiencing early implant losses. It is still unclear whether postoperative antibiotics are beneficial, or which antibiotics work best. The evidence from the six trials (1162 participants) that compared the use of antibiotics with placebo or no treatment was considered to be of moderate quality. However, the one trial (100 participants) that investigated antibiotics given for different lengths of time was found to be at high risk of bias.
This is a systematic review of clinical research testing whether taking the antibiotic can prevent infection from a water-borne bacteria called Leptospira. Data from different trials had conflicting results, and these trials targeted different kinds of people - travellers and people who live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students. Taken together, the data does not support the practice in all cases, though short term travellers with a potential for high risk exposure may be helped. People who took doxycycline were more likely to have stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting but the medication had to be stopped in only a few participants.
There is a need for randomised studies to find out which drugs are the most effective treatments for nausea and vomiting in these patients. In the updated review we identified one ongoing study which aims to assess how well levomepromazine improves nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer.
The evidence is current up to March 2014. We identified 27 studies and included the outcomes of 1976 participants. Studies investigated the outcomes of patients undergoing planned surgical procedures on the abdomen (18), the bones or joints (4), the heart (4) or the thyroid gland (1).
Eighteen studies compared carbohydrate supplements versus an identical appearing placebo drink that did not contain carbohydrates; in six of these studies, an additional group of patients had nothing to eat or drink for at least six hours before surgery. In nine studies, taking carbohydrate supplements was compared with having nothing to eat or drink for six hours before surgery.
The primary outcomes of length of hospital stay and complication rate were reported by 19 and 14 studies, respectively. Patients given carbohydrates before planned surgical procedures went home between 0.04 and 0.56 days sooner than those receiving a placebo drink or having nothing to eat or drink before surgery. Carbohydrate supplements had little or no effect on complication rate or on how people feel in-hospital during recovery from surgery. The overall quality of the evidence varied from very low to high. The quality of evidence in support of carbohydrate supplements resulting in a shorter hospital stay was very low because the included studies had important flaws in their design, a very wide range of results was described and evidence revealed that studies showing no differences in length of hospital stay may not have been published. When we looked only at well-conducted studies, we found that carbohydrate supplements had little or no effect on length of hospital stay.
The quality of evidence to support the effects of carbohydrate supplements on complication rate was low because issues with study design were identified and results were not similar across studies.
This is an update of our 2012 review. We added one new trial (565 participants) for a total nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children, 950 adults). The included trials were conducted in emergency department (7 trials) and primary care (2 trials) settings in the USA (5 trials), and one trial each in Canada, Israel, Turkey, and the UK. Participants received either a single dose of steroids or a single dose of a dummy drug (placebo) (7 trials). More than one consecutive daily dose of steroid or placebo was given to one group of participants, whilst the other group received a single dose (2 trials). In eight trials all participants also received antibiotics immediately on entry to the study. All trials were published in English. Two studies described funding sources (government and a university foundation). Participants who received corticosteroids were 2.4 times more likely to experience complete resolution of sore throat symptoms by 24 hours than those who received placebo. Corticosteroids improved times to both start symptom relief and to completely resolve symptoms, although trial evidence was not consistent for these outcomes, and effects were modest. Adverse events, recurrence/relapse rates, and days missed from work or school did not differ between corticosteroid and placebo group participants. Sore throats are very common in children, but only two trials reported results for children, and these results were inconsistent, making it difficult to draw conclusions. Further research is therefore needed to examine the benefits of corticosteroids for both reducing antibiotic use in people with severe sore throat, and the benefit for children specifically. Limitations were that only two trials included children and that most trials also gave antibiotics to all participants. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as high for complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours, and moderate for mean time to onset of pain relief, mean time to complete resolution of pain, absolute reduction in pain measured by visual analogue scales, adverse events, recurrence/relapse rates, and days missed from work or school.
Ten studies examined the effects of working wrist splints, resting hand and wrist splints, and wearing special shoes/ insoles in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Although there is no evidence that wearing resting wrist and hand splints changed pain, grip strength, or number of swollen joints, participants who wore these splints for two months preferred to wear them, and also preferred padded splints. One study provided evidence that wearing extra-depth shoes for two months resulted in significant benefits of less pain on walking and stair climbing. Extra-depth shoes with semi-rigid insoles provided better pain relief than extra-depth shoes alone.
We wanted to learn how single-incision slings compare to other surgeries for urinary incontinence. We were interested in their effects on:
- curing or improving urinary incontinence;
- risk of pain and painful sex;
- risk of mesh erosions (exposure of or protrusion of tape into the vagina);
- urinary retention;
- risk of injuries and infections;
- need for further surgery;
- quality of life. We searched for studies that compared single-incision slings to:
- other types of slings;
- other types of surgeries;
- conservative treatment (e.g. pelvic floor exercises) or no treatment.
We compared and summarised the studies’ results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 62 studies with 8051 women that compared single-incision slings to other sling surgeries. The women varied in age, weight and number of children born.
Ten studies received funding from industry or device manufacturers. Of these, 4 made a clear statement that industry sponsors were not involved in study design, conduct or writing. The remaining 6 studies provided few or unclear details. One study compared single-incision to autologous slings and found that there is little difference between the 2 operations for the complications of painful sex and mesh exposure/erosions. The study did not report on other outcomes.
Single-incision versus retropubic slings: 10 studies
- There is little to no difference between these procedures for patient-reported cure or improvement of urinary incontinence. 
- Single-incision slings may cause more mesh erosions compared to retropubic slings, but the evidence is uncertain. 
- We do not know whether single-incision slings have any effect on the risk of urinary retention, the need for further surgery or quality of life compared with retropubic slings. 
- There was no information on long-term pain or painful sex.
Single-incision versus transobturator slings: 51 studies
- Women who have single-incision slings are just as likely to have their incontinence cured or improved at 12 months as those with transobturator slings. 
- Women with single-incision slings may have: (a) a similar number of mesh erosions and (b) the same risk of urinary retention, but (c) report less pain. 
- We are uncertain whether single-incision slings affect the risk of painful sex. 
- Women may have a slightly poorer quality of life at 12 months compared to women with transobturator slings. 
- It is unclear whether the slings differ in the risk of needing further surgery later. Overall, we could not be certain of the results comparing single-incision slings to either autologous slings or retropubic slings because the studies were small and varied in important ways. We have more confidence in the substantial amount of evidence comparing single-incision to transobturator slings; this evidence is less likely to change with the publication of more trials. This review updates our previous version. The evidence is current to September 2022.
Only amantadine has been tested in randomised clinical trials including participants with chronic hepatitis C. The main goal of these trials was to investigate whether amantadine as a single therapy or amantadine in combination with other antiviral therapies, compared with placebo or no intervention (with or without antiviral therapy), could increase the proportion of patients with virus eradication from the blood. This review evaluates whether amantadine versus other antiviral drugs has any beneficial or harmful effect in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared amantadine with ribavirin, mycophenolate mofetil, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma. The primary outcomes were the composite of all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and adverse events. This review includes six randomised clinical trials with a total of 581 patients. All the included trials were with high risk of bias. This review did not demonstrate any benefits or harms of amantadine on all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and on adverse events, but data were sparse. Compared with ribavirin , amantadine seemed to lead to more participants who fail to achieve sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment). This may be real or due to bias (systematic errors), but it does not seem to be due to play of chance (random errors), as trial sequential analysis confirmed the result. Compared with mycophenolate mofetil , amantadine seemed less effective in achieving end-of-treatment virological response. Compared with interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma, amantadine did not seem to offer benefits. Accordingly, the evidence from this review does not support the routine clinical use of amantadine. Therefore, it is probably better to examine the effects of other direct acting antivirals in the hepatitis C field than to conduct more randomised clinical trials on amantadine. We found no randomised clinical trials assessing other aminoadamantanes, for example rimantadine.
We identified two trials with 156 participants for this review. The comparisons included in these two trials were 1) percutaneous cholecystostomy plus laparoscopic cholecystectomy (key hole removal of gallbladder) immediately after the general condition improves (percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy) versus planned delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed routinely (1 trial; 70 participants) and 2) percutaneous cholecystostomy versus conservative treatment (supportive treatment and antibiotic treatment) (1 trial; 86 participants). Both trials were at high risk of systematic error (prone to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trials were designed and data were analysed). There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who died or developed complications between any of the comparison groups. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy in the only comparison that reported this outcome (percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy). The mean total hospital stay and mean costs were significantly lower in the percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group compared with the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Because of the few trials included in this review and due to their low sample size, there is risk of random errors (play of chance). Based on the current available evidence, we are unable to determine the role of percutaneous cholecystostomy in the clinical management of high-risk surgical patients with acute cholecystitis. There is a need for well-designed clinical trials with low risk of systematic error and random errors on this issue.
We identified five studies. Two of these were concerned with diet advice given concerning general health (one was about alcohol and one was about fruit and vegetable consumption). In both these studies there was a change to healthier behaviour following the advice.
We also identified three studies which attempted to change sugar consumption habits in order to reduce dental decay. However, in two out of these three studies there were also other types and forms of advice given at the same time, for example about toothbrushing. It was therefore impossible to say whether changes in diet came about because of the diet advice given or because they were subtly influenced by the other messages. For example: advice on toothbrushing might make patients more aware of their oral health resulting in changes to their diet. Most of the studies concerning sugar consumption are of relatively weak quality. The evidence for dietary advice aiming to change sugar consumption is poor. Further studies in this area should be considered.
We decided to investigate whether there is enough evidence from medical trials to show whether sweet potato works as a treatment for diabetes. This review of randomised controlled trials found only three studies (with a total of 140 participants) that evaluated the effects of sweet potato for type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with a fake medicine (placebo). All these trials were of very low quality. Two studies with 122 participants showed improved long-term metabolic control of blood sugar levels as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) which was moderately lowered by 0.3% in participants who were given 4 g sweet potato tablets a day for three to five months. The duration of treatment ranged from six weeks to five months. No study investigated diabetic complications, death from any cause, health-related quality of life, well-being, functional outcomes or costs. Adverse effects were mostly mild, and included abdominal distension and pain. There are many varieties of sweet potatoes and sweet potato preparations. More trials are needed to assess the quality of the various sweet potato preparations as well as to evaluate further the use of different varieties of sweet potato in the diet of diabetic people.
We wanted to know if corticosteroids given acutely (within one week of the onset of the rash) during a herpes zoster infection would be effective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. We included studies that compared corticosteroids with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments. We also included trials that compared corticosteroids plus routine treatment with placebo plus routine treatment. We searched for all relevant randomised controlled trials that described the effects of corticosteroids on preventing postherpetic neuralgia after an acute herpes zoster infection. We also assessed how certain the evidence was, considering factors, such as study size and the way in which studies were conducted. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included five studies examining the effects of corticosteroids on a total of 787 participants in our analysis. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids, given by mouth during the acute phase of a zoster infection, in preventing postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash. Corticosteroids given orally or intramuscularly may result in little to no difference in the risk of adverse events in people with acute herpes zoster. Based on the available studies, very low-certainty evidence neither supports nor refutes the use of corticosteroids in acute herpes zoster infection for preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Our confidence is very limited because the results from the studies involved a limited number of people. Some studies did not clearly report the method of randomisation, allocation concealment, or whether the lack of compliance was due to inefficacy or side effects, which could have affected the study's results. Overall, we have very little confidence in the evidence, and further studies are needed to investigate the effects of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. The evidence is up-to-date to 25 June 2022.
We wanted to compare implant-based reconstruction with autologous-tissue-based reconstruction to find out which technique:
• results in better quality of life (mental, sexual, and physical well-being);
• results in higher satisfaction with the operation and with the breast;
• limits short-term and long-term unwanted effects and the need for more surgeries; and
• takes less time. We searched for studies that compared autologous tissue-based breast reconstruction with implant-based breast reconstruction in women who had undergone mastectomy for cancer treatment or risk reduction. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 35 studies involving 57,555 women. Most studies were conducted in the USA or Europe.
Compared with implants, autologous reconstruction might lead to better mental and sexual well-being and greater satisfaction with the operation overall. The rest of the evidence was very uncertain; it suggested autologous reconstruction compared with implants may improve women's satisfaction with the look and feel of the breast and lead to fewer long-term unwanted effects, but may have little or no effect on physical well-being, the risk of short-term unwanted effects, or the need for additional surgeries. Implant-based surgery may take less time, but the evidence is very uncertain. We have little or very little confidence in the evidence, because women in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between the women rather than between the treatments. Indeed, many factors influence the choice of reconstructive technique.
In addition, there was no information on the characteristics of women who could benefit from one breast reconstruction technique over another. The evidence is current to July 2022.
We collected the most recent evidence (to July 2016) and conducted a meta-analysis according to the most appropriate methods for diagnostic tests. We included 42 studies with 4220 participants in the review. The analyses measured sensitivity (how well a test identified people with endoleak correctly) and specificity (how well a test identified people without endoleak correctly). The summary accuracy estimates were sensitivity 82% (95% confidence interval 66% to 91%) and specificity 93% (95% confidence interval 87% to 96%) for ultrasonography without contrast; and sensitivity 94% (95% confidence interval 85% to 98%) and specificity 95% (95% confidence interval 90% to 98%) for ultrasonography with contrast. Use of contrast improved the sensitivity of ultrasound significantly. Based on these results, we would expect 94% of people with endoleaks will be correctly identified by contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Studies that evaluated contrast-enhanced ultrasound used better methods than the studies that evaluated ultrasound alone.
We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of education-based treatments compared with no education in people of all ages with CHD.
We included nine new trials which involved 8215 people with coronary heart disease that compared patient education with no education. We included a total of 22 trials that studied 76,864 people with heart disease, most of whom had survived heart attack, and had undergone heart bypass surgery or angioplasty (a procedure which opens blocked vessels that supply blood to heart muscle). Sixteen studies reported sources of funding; six did not report funding sources. One study was funded by an industrial sponsor, four by health insurance companies and 11 by government or public sources. Findings of this update are similar to the last review version (2011). Patient education, as part of a cardiac rehabilitation programme, does not contribute to fewer deaths, further heart attacks, heart by-pass or angioplasty, or admission to hospital for heart-related problems. There is some evidence of fewer other heart-related events and improvements in health-related quality of life with education-based interventions. Individual causes of death were not reported, so we were unable to determine how many people in the studies died from heart-related causes or other causes of death.
Although there is insufficient information at present to fully understand the benefits or harms of patient education for people with heart disease, our findings broadly support current guidelines that people with heart disease should receive comprehensive rehabilitation that includes education. Further research is needed to evaluate the most clinically and cost-effective ways of providing education for people with heart disease. Overall, evidence was assessed as very low to moderate quality.
We identified 26 randomised controlled trials, involving 21,704 participants, that examined the effect of adrenaline or vasopressin on survival after cardiac arrest that occurred in and out of hospital and in adults and children. Some studies compared adrenaline in standard doses with placebo (dummy medication); some examined standard-dose versus high-dose adrenaline; and others compared vasopressin alone or vasopressin plus adrenaline to standard doses of adrenaline. The source of funding was not stated in 11 of the 26 studies. The study drugs were provided by the manufacturer in four of the 26 studies, but neither drug represents a profitable commercial option. The other 11 studies were funded by organisations such as research foundations and government funding bodies. The studies found evidence that adrenaline was effective at restarting the heart and helping people recover enough to go home from hospital. However, there was no evidence that any of the drugs improved survival with a good neurological outcome. The overall quality of evidence ranged from low to moderate (for studies comparing adrenaline to placebo), but mainly low or very low for the other comparisons, due to risks of bias within the studies. Many of these studies were conducted more than 20 years ago. Treatment has changed in recent years, so the findings from older studies may not reflect current practice. The studies examined the drugs in many different situations (in and outside of hospitals, at different dosages, and in both adults and children), which may make combining findings misleading.
This review carefully examines all the available high-quality clinical trials on caffeine in asthma. This review was conducted to discover if people should avoid consuming caffeine before taking lung function tests.
This review found that even small amounts of caffeine can improve lung function for up to four hours. Therefore caffeine can affect the result of a lung function test (e.g. spirometry) and so caffeine should be avoided before taking a lung function test if possible, and previous caffeine consumption should be recorded.
It is not known if taking caffeine leads to improvements in symptoms. It may be that in order to improve the symptoms of asthma, caffeine is needed in such large amounts that the drug's adverse effects would become a problem, so more research is needed.
Another clinical trial looked at the effect of caffeine on exhaled nitric oxide levels and found that there is no significant effect, so it appears unlikely that patients would need to avoid caffeine before taking this type of test. However, this is the result of just a single study so more research is needed to clarify this.
Review authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 8 October 2014. The review includes six studies published from 1967 to 1997, which involved 252 children as participants (although data were supplied on only 246 of the children). Three of the studies were carried out in the USA, one in Canada, one in Sweden and one in Australia.
Not all of the studies gave the ages of children involved; in four of the studies children were aged from two and a half to 18 years old, in one study they were aged four years and over and in another nine years and over. Use of an orthodontic brace (such as a palatal crib or arch) or a psychological intervention (such as use of positive or negative reinforcement), or both, was more likely to lead to cessation of the habit than no treatment. Most of the trials that compared two different interventions were inconclusive but one study suggested that, of two different types of braces,a palatal crib is more effective than a palatal arch design. The evidence presented is of low quality due to the small number of participants in the few available studies and problems with the way in which the studies were conducted. There was a high risk of bias across the studies. Orthodontic braces or psychological intervention seems to be effective to help children stop sucking that does not have a feeding purpose but the evidence is low quality. Further high quality clinical trials are required to guide decision making for what is a common problem that can require lengthy and expensive dental treatment to correct.
Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 307 participants with IBS were included. Two RCTs (129 participants) compared a homeopathic remedy (asafoetida and asafoetida plus nux vomica) to a placebo remedy for the treatment of people with IBS-C. One study (23 participants) compared individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care in female patients diagnosed with IBS. One study (94 participants) was a three armed study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment plus usual care, supportive listening plus usual care and usual care.
The four trials tested the effects of homeopathic treatment on the severity of IBS symptoms. No conclusions can be drawn from the RCT comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care due to the small number of participants and the low quality of reporting in this trial. This study was carried out in 1990 and usual care for IBS may have changed since then making the results difficult to compare to current treatments.
No conclusions can be drawn from the three armed study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment plus usual care, supportive listening plus usual care and usual care due to the small number of participants in the homeopathic treatment arm (n=16).
The results of two small studies were combined (129 participants) and this suggested that there may be a possible benefit for clinical homeopathy, using the remedy asafoetida, over placebo for patients with IBS-C at a short-term follow-up of two weeks. However both of the studies were carried out in the 1970s when the reporting of trials was not as comprehensive as it is now and we are very uncertain about these results and cannot suggest a possible benefit for clinical homeopathy. The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of homeopathy for the treatment of IBS can be drawn. Further high quality RCTs enrolling larger numbers of patients are required to assess the effectiveness and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy for IBS.
The people included in the studies were adults over 18 years of age in outpatient settings, for whom lipid-lowering therapy was recommended. We now include 35 studies covering 925,171 participants in this review. Of the 35 included studies, 16 compared interventions categorised as 'intensified patient care' versus usual care. These interventions included electronic reminders, pharmacist-led interventions, and healthcare professional education to help people better remember to take their medications. These types of interventions when compared to standard care demonstrated significantly better adherence rates both over the short term (up to and including six months) as well as the long term (longer than six months). Additionally, cholesterol levels were better over both long- and short-term periods in those offered the intervention, compared to those receiving usual care. We considered only randomised controlled trials for this review. Given the nature of the interventions, it was not possible to keep participants unaware of which group they were in. However, analysis of other forms of bias indicated that generally the studies were at low risk of bias. We assessed the evidence for the outcomes using the GRADE system, and rated it as high quality for long-term adherence (more than six months) and for reduction in total cholesterol, and moderate quality for short-term medication adherence (up to six months) and for LDL-cholesterol levels. For the outcome total cholesterol levels at less than six months follow-up, we downgraded the evidence to low quality.
This study undertook a comprehensive search of the literature unrestricted by country of publication or language. Unfortunately small numbers of relevant trials were found and these were of variable quality. This review found that although anticholinergic drugs are well tolerated, in children over two years of age, there is not enough data to be sure if they are better than placebo in terms of effects on lung function or symptoms.
We found four studies in which antibiotics alone had been compared with antibiotics plus corticosteroids for the treatment of bacterial keratitis. These studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, India, and South Africa, and included a total of 612 eyes of 611 participants. The largest study included 500 participants followed for one year. The three smaller studies followed participants for two to three months. The evidence is current to July 2014. None of the four studies reported an important difference between topical corticosteroid therapy and placebo or control treatment for reduction in ulcer size, change in visual acuity, adverse events, or quality of life. One study reported that healing or cure time in the steroid group was slower than the placebo group (for every 100 people cured in the control group, only 47 were cured in the steroid group during the same time period), but the largest study did not report any difference (for every 100 people cured in the control group, 92 were cured in the steroid group during the same time interval). For adverse events, none of the studies found a difference between the two groups, except that one study reported that more eyes in the control group developed intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. We did not find any information on economic outcomes. Generally, the quality of the evidence based on the four studies we identified was moderate due to the proportions of participants who were not included in the final study analyses and the inconsistency of outcomes assessed across the four studies. In addition, three studies enrolled too few participants (30 to 42) to reach scientifically valid conclusions.
We found 20 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing diet, physical activity and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments (interventions) to a variety of control groups (who did not receive treatment) delivered to parents only of 3057 children aged 5 to 11 years. There were few similarities between the trials in the nature and types of interventions used. We grouped the trials by the type of comparisons. Our systematic review reported on the effects of the parent-only interventions compared with parent and child interventions, waiting list controls (where the intervention was delayed until the end of the trial), other interventions with only minimal information or contact and other types of parent-only interventions. The children in the included trials were monitored (called follow-up) for between six months and two years. This evidence is up to date as of March 2015. The most reported outcome was the body mass index (BMI). This is a measure of body fat and is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m2). The studies measured BMI in ways that took account of gender, weight and height as the children grew older (such as the BMI z score and the BMI percentile).
When compared with a waiting list control, there was limited evidence that parental interventions helped to reduce BMI. In looking at the longest follow-up periods of the included trials, we did not find firm evidence of an advantage or disadvantage of parent-only interventions when compared with either parent and child interventions, or when compared with limited information. Our review found very little information about how different types of parental interventions compared. No trial reported on death from any cause, illness or socioeconomic effects (such as whether parent-only interventions are lower in costs compared with parent and child interventions). Two trials reported no serious side effects and the rest of the trials did not report whether side effects occurred or not. Information on parent-child relationships and health-related quality of life was rarely reported. The overall quality of the evidence was low, mainly because there were just a few trials per measurement or the number of the included children was small. In addition, many children left the trials before they had finished.
Eight of the trials (91,122 participants) were included in the main outcome analysis of lung cancer-related mortality. In people over 40 years with significant smoking exposure, CT screening reduced deaths from lung cancer by 21%, with 226 people needing to undergo screening to prevent one death from lung cancer. We also found that deaths from any cause (including lung cancer) were less with CT screening. However, the effect was much lower (only 5% reduction in risk). Lung cancer was detected more frequently in the group of people who had CT screening compared with no screening. However, CT scans can induce false-positive scans (a test that is positive or indeterminate for lung cancer, when the person does not actually have lung cancer). We found that false-positive results were more common among people who were screened with CT than chest x-ray. Because of that, those that underwent CT screening had more tests to investigate both cancer and non-cancer-related diseases. Screening also implies a risk of detecting lung cancers that may have never progressed to cause harm to the person (this is referred to as overdiagnosis). The risk of lung cancer overdiagnosis with CT screening was estimated to be 18%.
The trials were too different or did not provide enough information to look at the impact of screening on stopping smoking or quality of life. There was some evidence to suggest there were no long-term psychological harms from screening, with some people in the CT screening group feeling less anxious compared to the control groups who were not offered screening. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate when it came to outcomes regarding death, with moderate- to low-certainty evidence for other outcomes. The certainty rating for outcomes reflects the authors' confidence and certainty in the outcome being correct.
This review aimed to provide an updated summary of all the evidence available on this topic. In particular, we wanted to find out:
– how effective antidepressants are compared to placebo in treating generalised anxiety disorder;
– how acceptable antidepressants are compared to placebo in treating generalised anxiety disorder; and
– how many unintended and harmful effects antidepressants have compared to placebo in people with generalised anxiety disorder. We searched for studies that compared antidepressants to placebo for treating adults with generalised anxiety disorder but no other serious co-occurring medical conditions. We found 37 studies that involved 12,226 adults with generalised anxiety disorder. The studies lasted between four and 28 weeks.
Antidepressants were more effective than placebo in reducing anxiety and there was no difference between antidepressants and placebo in the total number of people leaving the studies early.
Fewer people in the antidepressant group dropped out of the studies early due to the antidepressant being considered ineffective compared to placebo and more people in the antidepressant group dropped out of the studies early because of unwanted effects compared to placebo. We are confident in our findings as they apply to people with generalised anxiety disorder but without other co-occurring medical conditions. However, the evidence is not strong enough to create a clinical guideline for people with other co-occurring medical conditions as they were excluded from our analyses. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.
We grouped the 28 included trials according to the kind of supplement they used and how it might work.
Most of the trials were not originally designed to study cognition or dementia and used only simple measures of cognition. Very few studies investigated whether participants developed dementia. Long-term studies are probably needed to find effects on the risk of dementia or cognitive decline but only 10 studies had an average length of follow-up longer than five years. The studies were generally well-conducted although the longer trials had difficulty following up all of the participants and this could have biased some of the longer-term results.
There were 14 trials of B vitamins (folic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12) with nearly 28,000 participants, mainly in their 60s and 70s. Most of these trials were quite short (less than two years). We found no evidence that B vitamins had any effect on cognition.
There were 8 trials of antioxidant vitamins (beta-carotene/vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E) with approximately 47,000 participants. These trials tended to be longer than the B vitamin trials so may have had more chance of detecting effects on dementia and cognitive decline. The results were mixed. We found low-certainty evidence of better overall cognitive function after an average of 18 years taking beta-carotene and after five years to 10 years taking vitamin C, but no effects after shorter periods of treatment. There were also small benefits of beta-carotene, vitamin C, and antioxidant combinations on memory at some time points but not others. There was no evidence of any benefits from vitamin E alone. Two studies examined the risk of developing dementia. One found no effect of a combination of antioxidant vitamins and the other found no effect of vitamin E, either alone or combined with the mineral selenium. Most of the studies did not report any information about harmful effects. One included trial was designed to look for an effect on the risk of prostate cancer; it found a higher risk among the men taking vitamin E.
There was a small trial of vitamin D supplements which found they probably had no effect on cognition over six months. There were longer trials of vitamin D with calcium (one trial), zinc and copper (one trial), and complex multivitamins (three trials). All lasted between five and 10 years, but none of them found any evidence of beneficial effects on cognition. One trial found no effect of selenium taken for approximately five years on the risk of developing dementia. We found no good evidence to suggest that middle-aged or older people can preserve cognitive function or prevent dementia by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. There were a few positive results associated with long-term use of antioxidant vitamins, particularly beta-carotene and vitamin C, although the effects were small. Further research into the effects of these vitamins may be worthwhile.
We found two relevant studies to include in the review. Both studies were randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) in which participants had a diagnosis of UCC. Participants received either an intervention including SLT techniques or 'healthy lifestyle advice' as a control group. We chose to use health-related quality of life and serious adverse events to judge whether SLT is a useful intervention. Only one of the studies comparing SLT to usual care reported data about quality of life (using a questionnaire). After four weeks, participants in the study who were receiving the SLT treatment, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy intervention (PSALTI), had on average an improvement in their quality of life compared to people in the control group. However, this benefit compared to control was short-lived and disappeared after four weeks. This means that although the treatment appeared to work in the shorter term, it may not improve quality of life in the longer term compared to usual care.
We also looked for information about side effects or harms of the treatment. The same study reported that no one experienced serious side effects or harms during the study.
Other ways of measuring the impact of SLT were also considered, and in each case relevant data were only provided by one study. An improvement in objective cough counts (using a cough monitor), symptoms (using symptom scores), and clinical improvement was shown with SLT compared to controls. The included trials reported no difference for other secondary outcomes such as subjective measures of cough or cough reflex sensitivity (measured in the laboratory using airway irritants). The small number of high-quality, relevant studies found in this review means that we cannot be sure of the overall benefits of SLT in the management of UCC. Improvements in health-related quality of life were associated with the PSALTI intervention over a short period in one study, but further research is required to replicate this finding. Overall, more controlled trials are required to fully examine the potential of SLT for the management of UCC.
In the last few years, several randomised trials of high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) with autologous transplantation in patients with aggressive lymphoma have been reported. These studies have included incorporation of autotransplantation into the initial treatment, use of adjuvant autotransplantation in complete responders, and the use of this treatment approach in patients responding slowly or incompletely to their primary chemotherapy regimen. In this trials conflicting results of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous transplantation as part of first-line treatment have been reported. A few studies indicated a trend towards a better survival for patients with a poor prognosis according to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index score, whereas others failed to show an advantage for primary high-dose chemotherapy. Therefore we undertook this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of such treatment on overall survival in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
The main results from this analysis are: 
(i) In general, there was no evidence that HDT improves overall survival (OS) (HR 1.05; CI 0.92 to 1.19) or event free survival (EFS) (HR 0.92; CI 0.80 to 1.05). 
(ii) In patients with good risk aaIPI there was some evidence for worse OS (HR 1.46; CI 1.02 to 2.09) when treated with HDT. 
(iii) In contrast, there was suggestive but inconclusive evidence that poor risk patients may benefit from HDT.
Overall, with respect to the large population included in our analyses and the attempts made to minimise bias and confounding, we conclude that there is no evidence for a general benefit of the therapeutic principle of myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with aggressive NHL as first-line treatment based on the data presently available.
We have seen improvements for relapse free survival and complete remission rates but this was not translated into a benefit concerning the OS in the respective groups.
Most importantly, IPI low-risk patients appear to be harmed by high-dose chemotherapy in first-line treatment: patients. Furthermore with the availability of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab good risk patients will have a better overall outcome after a combined conventional immunochemotherapy. However, if HDT is employed for high risk patients, there may be a benefit, but physicians should not arbitrarily employ HDT during first-line treatment. There is a strong need to treat this group of high-risk patients in large trials with harmonized procedures and definitions, which would facilitate the comparability of results, and improve the assessment of therapeutic intervention. Further research should aim at either reproducing the studies showing positive trends or applying new approaches that do not solely rely on the principle of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous transplantation.
Up to August 2016, this review found 67 trials, including data from over 110,000 participants. Smoking cessation data after six months or more were available for 35,969 participants. We examined a range of Internet interventions, from a low intensity intervention, for example providing participants with a list of websites for smoking cessation, to intensive interventions consisting of Internet-, email- and mobile phone-delivered components. We classed interventions as tailored or interactive, or both. Tailored Internet interventions differed in the amount of tailoring, from multimedia components to personalised message sources. Some interventions also included Internet-based counselling or support from nurses, peer coaches or tobacco treatment specialists. Recent trials incorporated online social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, and other online forums. In combined results, Internet programmes that were interactive and tailored to individual responses led to higher quit rates than usual care or written self-help at six months or longer. There were not many trials conducted in younger people. More trials are needed to determine the effect on Internet-based methods to aid quitting in youth and young adults. Results should be interpreted with caution, as we rated some of the included studies at high risk of bias, and for most outcomes the quality of evidence was moderate or low.
This review shows that intravenous infusions of infliximab, a TNF-α blocking agent is effective in inducing clinical remission, promoting mucosal healing, and reducing the need for colectomy in patients with active ulcerative colitis whose disease has not responded to conventional treatment.
The evidence is current to February 2015. The review authors did not find any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for mumps. Although no trials were included, we reviewed the studies and found no reports of adverse events with Chinese medicinal herbs as a treatment for mumps. High-quality trials are needed to answer these questions.
In populations with a high risk of developing a new depressive episode in the next winter, results show that antidepressants can prevent winter depression in about one in four people. In populations with a lower risk of recurrence, antidepressants can prevent a new depressive episode in one of eight people. The other seven people suffer from winter depression despite treatment or would not have suffered from winter depression anyway. People using antidepressants are at slightly higher risk of experiencing headaches, nausea or insomnia when compared with people not taking antidepressants.
Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of antidepressants and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as light treatment, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, the decision for or against preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare antidepressants against other treatments, such as light therapy, psychological therapies or other drugs to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression.
We searched for well-designed trials to see the effect of TENS compared to 'sham' TENS in people with SCD for relieving pain, reducing the intensity of pain, reducing the frequency of pain episodes, making a difference to the use of painkillers, improving quality of life and for assessing any adverse effects.
We only found one trial (22 participants aged between 12 and 27 years). The participants were graded into four groups according to how severe their pain was. On the first visit, the participants from different groups were chosen randomly to receive either TENS or ‘sham’ TENS treatment. For a further crisis of the same severity participants were given the alternative intervention to the first one. For those experiencing a pain episode of a different severity, it is not clear which treatment they were given.
Neither the participant nor the researcher were aware of which treatment was received. 30 episodes (across 22 participants) of TENS treatment and 30 of 'sham' TENS treatment were analysed. Due to low-quality data and issues with the trial design, we can only report in a descriptive way without any formal analysis. Caution should be used in interpreting these results. In the included trial no difference was found in the rating of pain on a scale of 1 to 10 at the end of one hour and four hours between the TENS and 'sham' TENS treatment groups. There was no difference between groups as to how much pain medication was used. Given the very low quality of the evidence, we are also uncertain whether TENS improves overall satisfaction as compared to 'sham' TENS. A minor adverse effect of itching was reported by only one person receiving TENS, whereas two people receiving 'sham' TENS reported a worsening of pain with the intervention. Since there is only one included trial with very low-quality evidence, we cannot state whether TENS makes any difference to managing pain in people with SCD. The trial publication did not clearly report how the randomised list for allocating the participants to the two treatment groups was generated, therefore, we assessed this as having a high risk of bias. The reporting and analysis was based on only the total number pain events and not the number of people reporting pain episodes. It is unclear from this report how many participants were crossed over from TENS to 'sham' TENS treatment group. The first treatment may have an effect on the subsequent treatment and there is no clear data regarding the cross over process from one treatment group to the other. Hence we conclude that the trial has a high risk of bias and the results are hard to interpret.
The herb black cohosh was traditionally used by Native Americans to treat menstrual irregularity, with many experimental studies indicating a possible use for black cohosh in menopause. This review set out to evaluate the effectiveness of black cohosh for controlling the symptoms of menopause. The review of 16 studies (involving 2027 women) found insufficient evidence to support the use of black cohosh for menopausal symptoms. Given the uncertain quality of most studies included in the review, further research investigating the effectiveness of black cohosh for menopausal symptoms is warranted. Such trials need to give greater consideration to the use of other important outcomes (such as quality of life, bone health, night sweats and cost-effectiveness), stringent study design and the quality reporting of study methods.
The review of trials found that early treatment slows the progression of the disease. However, there is not enough evidence, due to too few studies conducted in patients with early stage myeloma to show that early treatment improves the survival of people with MM.
Studies have shown that these babies have higher energy expenditure and lower energy intake compared with babies without CLD/BPD. Increasing energy intake for these babies beyond standard levels may therefore seem beneficial. However, setting high targets for energy intake for these babies may not be achievable. Furthermore, methods of increasing energy intake such as increasing the milk volume or concentration or giving intravenous nutrition may lead to complications of their own. We planned to examine whether increasing energy intake for these babies improves their breathing status, their growth and development, and reduces their risk of death without producing significant complications. Having found no suitable study to date that answers these questions, we are currently unable to provide any evidence on whether increasing the energy intake for babies with (or developing) CLD/BPD is overall beneficial.
We analysed the findings of seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 359 CLI patients revealed by our literature search, which was current to 16 May 2018.
We evaluated two main sources of stem cell treatment, namely, 'bone marrow-mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs)' and 'mobilised peripheral blood stem cells (mPBSCs)'. Limited data suggest that BM-MNCs or mPBSCs resulted in similar rates of limb amputation and death. Also, the two cell sources appeared to yield similar numbers of patients with improved rest pain, ulcer healing, and lower limb blood flow parameters as measured via the ankle-brachial index (ABI). However, data from one RCT show that mPBSC implantation resulted in improved transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcO₂) readings when compared to BM-MNC. Data from one RCT show no clear difference in amputation rates between patients receiving high cell dose and low cell dose, and no difference in clinical outcomes whether patients received cell doses via intramuscular or intra-articular routes. Study authors reported no significant short-term adverse effects attributed to autologous cell implantation. The quality of evidence for all outcomes varied but was mostly low to very low owing to limitations in study design and lack of data for several important outcomes. Taken together, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to assess the effects of using a particular source or treatment regimen of cell-based therapy for CLI in clinical practice. Larger trials with longer follow-up are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits and safety of various cell-based products for patients with CLI.
We looked for studies lasting at least two months, in which it was decided at random whether a person received a mucolytic drug or a placebo. We did not include studies involving children or people with other breathing conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis.
We found 38 studies to include in our review. These studies included a total of 10,377 adults with COPD or chronic bronchitis. The studies used a variety of mucolytic drugs, including N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, and erdosteine and lasted from two months to three years. Mucolytics were taken by mouth between one and three times per day. These studies measured several different outcomes to find out if the drug was useful, including flare-ups, hospital admissions, quality of life, lung function, and side effects. We found that people taking mucolytic drugs were less likely to experience a flare-up compared to those taking placebo. Approximately eight people would need to take the drug for nine months for one extra person to avoid having a flare-up. This result was based on 28 studies involving 6723 people. However, the studies carried out a longer time ago (1970s to 1990s) show greater benefit than those carried out more recently. Shorter studies also seemed to show more benefit than longer studies. This could be because the newer trials were larger and may be showing that mucolytics are less beneficial than the earlier studies showed. Or it could be that only studies that showed mucolytics as beneficial were published before the 2000s, when there was a push to report all trial results regardless of whether or not they showed benefit.
People taking mucolytics had fewer days of disability (i.e. days when they could not do their normal activities) every month, but this was quite a small difference - less than half a day per person per month. They were also approximately one-third less likely to be admitted to hospital, although this result is based on only five studies that provided this information.
Study results suggest that mucolytics do not have an important impact on quality of life or lung function. People taking mucolytics did not experience more unwanted side effects than those taking placebo. But we could not be sure about their impact on death during the study period because only 37 deaths occurred amongst the 3527 participants in studies where deaths were measured and reported. We are moderately confident about the results we have presented. Our confidence is reduced by the results from individual studies looking quite different from one another and the mix of older and newer studies that we found. Also, in some cases there were not enough data to be sure whether mucolytics were better or worse than, or the same as, placebo. Mucolytics appear to be useful for reducing flare-ups, days of disability, and hospital admissions in people with COPD or chronic bronchitis, and they do not appear to cause more side effects. However, they do not appear to have much impact on quality of life or lung function, and we could not be sure about their impact on death.
This plain language summary is current to April 2019.
We identified 34 studies that used this approach and enrolled a total of 3643 infants born before term. Studies of variable quality have been conducted in many different countries. Early EPO treatment reduced the numbers of red blood cell transfusions and donor exposures following its use. However, the overall benefit of EPO may not be clinically important, as many of these infants had been exposed to red blood cell transfusions before trial entry. Early treatment with EPO does not alter the risk of death or retinopathy of prematurity and may decrease the risk of neurological damage and damage to the gut. It may also improve long-term outcomes. According to GRADE, the quality of the main outcomes ranged from high to low. On the basis of our findings, we do not currently recommend routine early use of erythropoietin in preterm infants. Ongoing studies might shed light on the possibility that erythropoietin may reduce risks of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes and necrotising enterocolitis.
We searched for studies up to May 2017. We included 34 trials in the review, with 2848 participants from 12 countries. The majority of trials (27) were set in an intensive care unit with one in a neonatal intensive care unit. The remaining seven studies were done in an operating department. Participants were infants in three studies with adults (average age of 40 to 69 years) in the remainder. There was no overall difference in the rates of airway blockage, pneumonia or death in adults who were ventilated through heat and moisture exchangers compared to adults ventilated through a heated humidifier. There was some evidence that the occurrence of pneumonia may be lowered by using heat and moisture exchangers that capture less moisture. There was not enough information to make any conclusions about either of these methods in children or infants. The overall low quality of this evidence was low, making it difficult to be confident about these findings.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any combination inhaler versus the same LABA component inhaler used by people with COPD. The studies were well-designed with low risk of bias for randomisation and blinding but there were high numbers of people who dropped out of the trials, which affected our confidence in the results for the outcomes.
Overall, we found 14 trials involving 11,794 people with COPD.
The results of the studies showed that combined inhalers reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared with their LABA component alone, from, for example, an average of one exacerbation per year on a long-acting beta2-agonist to an average of 0.76 exacerbations per year on a combined inhaler. The risk of mortality was similar between the treatments, although the overall result was not precise enough to rule out an effect in favour of either treatment. There was evidence of an overall increased risk of pneumonia with combined inhalers, from around three per 100 people per year on LABA to four per 100 per year on combined inhalers.
There was no significant difference between treatments in terms of hospitalisations although the results of the three studies were inconsistent so we cannot be certain what this means. Combined treatment was more effective than LABA in improving health-related quality of life, symptoms such as breathlessness and cough, some measures of lung function, and also reduced rescue medication use, but it is difficult to tell whether these differences would be meaningful for individual people with COPD. Fluticasone/salmeterol led to more candidiasis and chest infections compared with salmeterol.
Future research is required to show whether combined therapy reduces hospitalisations, and to better estimate the increased risks of pneumonia. This will need more trials with different doses of inhaled corticosteroids and including direct comparisons of different combination inhalers. The conclusions of the review are current to November 2011.
Malaria burden was compared in people receiving MDA and those who did not receive MDA, at different time points. The findings differed by malaria transmission setting. In areas with malaria prevalence of 10% or higher (moderate- to high-transmission areas), based on one trial, MDA did not reduce malaria in the population (low-certainty evidence). In areas with malaria prevalence under 10% (very low- to low-endemicity areas), evidence from seven trials indicates that MDA reduced malaria in the population immediately after MDA has stopped (low-certainty evidence), but we are uncertain if the decline continues long-term because the number of malaria cases in both intervention and control groups were low (very low-certainty evidence).
In all settings of malaria transmission, the type of antimalarial drug used for MDA, co-interventions such as mosquito control, coverage of MDA, and risk of re-introduction may have an impact on the effect of MDA compared to no MDA. However, we were unable to explore these factors due to the limited number of studies. We included studies available up to 11 February 2021.
The certainty of the evidence supporting the use of lymphaticovenular anastomosis in the prevention of lymphoedema was low, consisting of only two small studies from one centre. Similarly, only one single-centre study assessed the use of vascularised lymph node transfer and provided overall very low-certainty evidence supporting the use of the procedure in the treatment of upper limb lymphoedema.
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing any drug with placebo (a dummy treatment), other drugs or no treatment in people of any age with sleep bruxism. The evidence is current to August 2014. A total of 18 studies were identified and seven were included in the review. Each individual study involved a very small number of participants (7-16) and four of them were of moderate methodological quality. Amitriptyline (three studies), bromocriptine (one study), clonidine (one study), propranolol (one study), levodopa (Prolopa®) (one study) and tryptophan (one study) were compared with placebo. Amitriptyline and L-tryptophan did not reduce activity of the jaw muscles, measured using electromyography. Bromocriptine,clonidine, propanolol and levodopa did not significantly reduce the number of bruxism episodes per hour when compared to placebo. This systematic review concluded that there is not enough evidence in the literature to show that drugs can reduce sleep bruxism.
This review was updated in 2017. We included two randomized controlled trials (RCT; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), one involving 14 critically ill children with ARDS and one involving 67 critically ill adults with ARDS. The trials did not measure severity of illness, resolution of organ dysfunction, length of stay in intensive care unit or hospital, and quality of life. The study authors did not report side effects such as bleeding, organ dysfunction, airway reactivity or side effects unrelated to the intervention. None of the included trials reported receiving money from drug companies. Only the RCT involving children provided data on deaths, with no clear difference with and without prostacyclin.
The RCT in adults reported a trend towards improved blood oxygen levels, for participants who were treated with alprostadil (prostaglandin E1).
Therefore, we could not identify a clear advantage of the use of aerosolized prostacyclin in critically ill children or adults with low blood oxygen levels. The quality of the evidence was very low because of the limited number of participants and poor trial design. The RCT involving children used a cross-over design where one group received aerosolized prostacyclin first and the other group received saline (salt solution). They then changed over to the alternate treatment. There was insufficient information on the effect on death in both trials.
We conclude that there is a need for a large-scale clinical trial with low risk of misleading information to investigate the advantages and harms of prostacyclin for critically ill people.
 . Dopamine agonists versus placebo/no treatment
Dopamine agonists appear to reduce the incidence of moderate or severe OHSS in women at high risk of OHSS compared with placebo (a pretend treatment) or no treatment. This suggests that of every 100 women having IVF or ICSI, 27 women taking placebo or no treatment will have moderate or severe OHSS, compared to eight to 14 women taking dopamine agonists. Dopamine agonists may improve pregnancy outcomes, but we remain uncertain if it might increase mild side effects, such as stomach upsets, feeling sick, or dizziness. We are uncertain of the effect of dopamine agonists on pregnancy outcomes, as, pregnancy data were scarcely reported.
Dopamine agonist plus another treatment versus another treatment
Taking dopamine agonists combined with another active treatment may reduce the risk of moderate or severe OHSS compared to women taking another active treatment alone. This means that of 100 women having treatment with another active treatment alone for OHSS, 11 women will have moderate or severe OHSS compared to three to nine women using dopamine agonists plus another active treatment. We remain uncertain if dopamine combined with another treatment improves pregnancy outcomes and side effects.
Dopamine agonist versus another treatment
We are uncertain whether the dopamine agonist cabergoline decreases OHSS rates compared to other active treatments (e.g. hydroxyethyl starch, prednisolone, calcium infusion or coasting). We are uncertain whether cabergoline improves pregnancy outcomes compared with other interventions. There were no side effects in the only study for this comparison. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Limitations included poor reporting of study methods and imprecision (too few events, too few included studies) for some comparisons.
This review identified one study involving 200 pregnant women who received nitrofurantoin (antibiotics) and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) or close surveillance alone. Suppressive therapy with daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance was not shown to prevent RUTI compared with close surveillance alone but the evidence was of very low quality. A significant reduction of asymptomatic bacteriuria (presence of bacteria in the urine without the symptoms of a UTI) was found in women with a high clinic attendance rate who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Due to lack of evidence no conclusions can be drawn. Future randomised controlled trials comparing different pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are necessary to assess the optimal intervention to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. Such trials should report on a comprehensive range of outcomes for both women and infants.
We searched the medical literature to 19 May 2017 and found nine randomized (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) or partly (quasi) randomized trials (including 658 participants) that assessed the efficiency of IVIg in infants with alloimmune HDN. Analysis of all included studies showed a reduction in the need for and number of ETs in infants treated with IVIg combined with phototherapy compared to infants treated with phototherapy only. However, this was not confirmed in an analysis of the two placebo-controlled studies (where a pretend treatment was given). There was no difference in the need for or number of top-up transfusions. The evidence from the studies was very low quality. However, two studies used a placebo, thereby minimizing bias and allowing blinding of the researchers assessing the response. These studies were consistent with each other and yielded moderate quality evidence (with a relatively small total number of participants involved (172) being the only reason to not regard the level of evidence from them as high) that IVIg was ineffective in preventing ET or top-up transfusions. Based on all included studies, we could make no conclusions on the benefit of IVIg in preventing ET or top-up transfusion. However, the two placebo-controlled trials provided evidence of moderate quality that IVIg was ineffective in preventing ET or top-up transfusion, and therefore routine use in alloimmune HDN should not be recommended. However, since there was some evidence that IVIg reduced hemolysis (in laboratory studies), future high-quality studies are needed to determine whether IVIg has limited role in some infants with alloimmune HDN.
In this review we assessed the effect of these agents on erectile dysfunction in diabetic people. Eight studies with 976 men randomised to PDE-5 inhibitor therapy and a duration of mainly 12 weeks were evaluated. Compared to placebo treatment, these agents showed favourable effects in scores estimating sexual life, with an increased rate of adverse effects like headache and flushing after PDE-inhibitor therapy. Mortality was not reported in any of the included trials. Quality of life, with the exception of scores for sexual life, was not relevantly affected. If taken as prescribed, PDE-5 inhibitors comprise a valuable treatment option for erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes.
This review of trials found that UFH and LMWH when given to patients with high-risk unstable angina or NSTEMI in the acute phase of treatment, in addition to standard therapy with aspirin, prevent more heart attacks than placebo but do not reduce mortality, the need for revascularization procedures or recurrent angina. Although there was limited reporting of side-effects, heparins caused more cases of minor bleeding.
It has been used for physiological studies and it has also been proposed as a treatment for depression. Sixteen trials were included in the review and fourteen contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis. Most comparisons did not show differences between repetitive (rTMS) and other interventions. No difference was seen between rTMS and sham TMS using the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, except for one time period (after two weeks of treatment) for left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency; and also for right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and low frequency, both in favour of rTMS and both using the Hamilton scale. Comparison of rTMS (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency) with electroconvulsive therapy showed no difference except for psychotic patients after two weeks treatment, using the Hamilton scale, which indicated that electroconvulsive therapy was more effective than rTMS.
This systematic review identified six randomised clinical trials. No liver-related or unrelated deaths occurred in any of the included trials. Adverse events were minor and non-specific. Treatment with antioxidant supplements showed a significant, though not clinically relevant, amelioration of aspartate aminotransferase, but not of alanine aminotransferase, as compared to placebo or other interventions. Data on the radiological and/or histological response were too limited to draw any conclusions. Further placebo-controlled trials are necessary.
Although Huperzine A has been widely used in clinical practice and used as a standard intervention in clinical trials, its efficacy and safety in people with VaD are still uncertain. This review, involving 14 participants, indicates there is currently no high quality evidence to support the use of Huperzine A for the treatment of vascular dementia. Results from well-conducted randomized controlled trials are needed to assess accurately the benefits and harms of Huperzine A in people with VaD.
The review of trials found there was only limited evidence to support the use of surgery for primary dysmenorrhoea and little evidence for its use in women with endometriosis. No adverse effects were found with UNA but PSN was found to cause treatable constipation. More research is needed.
The evidence in this review is current up to January 2014. We included 12 studies, which included a total of 578 participants. Ten studies involved a total of 448 children and two involved a total of 130 adolescents and adults. Five studies did laboratory tests to confirm the presence of whooping cough in all participants who took part. Nine studies compared the medicine to a placebo (i.e. a 'dummy' medicine which did not contain the active ingredient being studied) and three studies compared the medicine to no treatment. Seven studies involved hospital inpatients. Three studies reported their start and finish dates; one study recruited participants over 14 months, another over 18 months and another over 31 months. Six studies including 196 participants reported their results in enough detail for us to assess them. Based on these results, antihistamines (one study, 49 participants), pertussis immunoglobulin (one study, 24 participants) and salbutamol (two studies, 42 participants) did not reduce the number of coughing bouts in patients with whooping cough. Neither pertussis immunoglobulin (one study, 46 participants) nor steroids (one study, 11 participants) decreased the length of time participants spent in hospital. One study reported similar rates of side effects in participants treated with pertussis immunoglobulin (4%; rash) or placebo (5%; loose stools, pain and swelling of the skin around where the injection was given). Studies of antihistamines, salbutamol and steroids did not report any results on side effects. None of these six studies reported any results on vomiting, cyanosis, serious complications, death or admission to hospital. Overall, the quality of evidence was low and many of the studies were conducted some years ago. Only three trials reported adequate details of how the type of treatment given was properly concealed from both participants and healthcare professionals. Methods of recording numbers of coughing bouts and whoops also differed between studies. Estimates of the effects of the different treatments were imprecise due to the small numbers of participants from whom results were available. Additionally, these results may not be generalisable to adults or community settings, since most studies involved children and were done in hospital inpatient settings.
Thirty-two studies were included in this review. However, only 22 studies, involving 2658 women, provided data for analysis, looking at interventions given prior to caesarean section for reducing the risk of aspiration. There were several different drugs and drug combinations being considered and the studies were generally of poor or questionable quality. Antacids (like sodium citrate), H2 receptor antagonists (like ranitidine), proton pump antagonists (like omeprazole), all reduced the acidity of the stomach contents. An antacid plus an H2 receptor antagonist also reduced acidity. In theory, a combination like this, where the antacid acts quickly and the H2 receptor antagonists takes a little longer, should protect at periods of greatest risk, i.e. the beginning and end of the procedure (i.e. intubation and extubation). More research is needed to identify the best combination of drugs and to check for possible adverse effects.
Antiviral drugs are often used, usually in conjunction with steroids, to treat sudden hearing loss of unknown cause, based on the theory that the deafness is caused by a viral infection. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared treatment of sudden hearing loss with antiviral drugs (either alone or in combination with another treatment) with placebo or no antiviral drug, in patients of any age. We found four RCTs (257 patients). The overall risk of bias in the studies was low. All four trials compared steroid treatment (either alone or plus a placebo drug) with steroid plus antiviral treatment. None of the trials found a statistically significant difference between groups. No trial documented any serious adverse effects related to using antiviral treatments. One study reported slight to moderate nausea equally in the acyclovir and placebo groups (one patient in each), both attributable to the steroid treatment. Another reported insomnia, nervousness and weight gain with valacyclovir (number not specified).
The effectiveness of antiviral drugs in the treatment of sudden hearing loss of unknown origin is questionable. Certainly, this review of the clinical trials did not identify any substantial evidence to support their use. Further research is required with larger patient numbers and standardised inclusion criteria, antiviral regimes and outcome measures.
In total, 28 articles on 24 unique studies met the inclusion criteria. Our results showed that the overall risk of arterial thrombosis was was 1.6-fold increased in women using oral contraceptive pills compared with women who did not use oral contraceptive pills. The risk did not vary clearly according to progestagen type. However, we found that the risk of arterial thrombosis seemed to be twice as high in women taking pills with higher doses of estrogen. Also, the risk of other side effects of oral contraceptive pills (such as a blood clot in a vein-venous thrombosis) should be considered before any type of oral contraceptive pill is prescribed. It is likely that the COC pill containing levonorgestrel and 30 µg of estrogen is the safest oral form of combined oral hormonal contraception. The overall quality of evidence in this review was moderate. Most studies (22 out of 28) correctly confirmed that patients had been diagnosed with arterial thrombosis. However, only four studies also checked that the type of pill a patient had been using was reported correctly. In addition, only half of the studies ensured that the correct comparisons were made between patients with and patients without arterial thrombosis. Also of importance is the fact that the analysis on progestagen type was based on few studies only.
We searched for studies published in any language from January 1980 to July 2015. We found 98 unique studies, for a total of 116 test evaluations, involving 101,121 children. The number of participants ranged from 42 to 11,644 across test evaluations. The proportion of children with strep throat ranged from 9.5% to 66.6% across test evaluations. Important study design features were frequently not reported. The overall methodological quality of included studies was poor. For most studies, we had concerns about the ways in which participants were selected. On average, rapid tests for strep throat had a sensitivity (ability to correctly detect people with the disease) of 86% and a specificity (ability to correctly identify people who do not have the disease) of 95%. There was substantial variability in rapid test performance across studies, which was not explained by study characteristics, including methodological quality. The two types of rapid tests under evaluation seemed to have comparable sensitivity (85.4% versus 86.2% for enzyme immunoassays and optical immunoassays, respectively). Based on these results, we would expect that amongst 100 children with strep throat, 86 would be correctly detected with the rapid test while 14 would be missed and not receive antibiotic treatment. Of 100 children with non-streptococcal sore throat, 95 would be correctly classified as such with the rapid test while 5 would be misdiagnosed as having strep throat and receive unnecessary antibiotics.
This updated review of over 4000 patients, in seven separate trials could find no evidence that adhesive drapes reduce surgical site infection rates, and some evidence that they may increase infection rates.
This review found five poor to moderate quality studies, of which four with a total of 282 women provided data. There was not enough evidence to say if systematic desensitisation worked better than another treatment. Further studies including larger numbers of women are needed to show if systematic desensitisation if effective for the treatment of women with vaginismus.
The results of the review show that in general talking therapies are more effective than no treatment. There was no strong evidence to support one talking therapy over the others for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. However, there was some low-quality evidence in favour of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy and supportive psychotherapy over other talking therapies for short-term remission and short-term reduction in symptoms. The results concerning supportive psychotherapy should, however, be treated with caution because of the small amount of evidence available about this treatment. On the other hand, beyond the evidence regarding its efficacy, psychodynamic therapy also showed promising results in terms of tolerability: as a way of assessing how well people tolerated the talking therapies, we assessed short-term dropout rates. We found that there were fewer dropouts in psychodynamic therapy and third-wave CBT, suggesting that people tolerate these therapies better than other therapies. More high-quality research is needed to be able to fully compare the effectiveness of different talking therapies. In particular, more new studies are needed that compare the specific talking therapies CBT, psychodynamic therapy and supportive psychotherapy for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.
Three trials involving 5905 participants were included. We found very little evidence in relation to the use of formoterol and budesonide for relief of symptoms in people with mild asthma, but in people with more severe asthma who had suffered exacerbations in spite of regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, we found that reliever formoterol and budesonide compared favourably with terbutaline in reducing asthma exacerbations that required a course of oral corticosteroids. However only a small proportion of the 'severe asthma exacerbations' as defined in the trials led to hospital admissions, and no significant overall benefit has yet been shown for this outcome. In children with asthma that was not controlled with regular inhaled corticosteroids, there were fewer serious adverse events when formoterol and budesonide were used to relieve symptoms as well as for maintenance treatment.
Twenty-eight studies in which newborn babies who were by chance in the kangaroo care group or condition were included from an extensive search of the literature. Skin-to-skin care was clearly defined and could have been compared to no pain-reducing strategies or other pain-reducing strategies such as sweet taste. Studies were examined which examined well-established signs of pain, both physiological and behavioural, as well as a combination of physiological and behavioural signs. Different providers of skin-to-skin care other than the mother were included. Kangaroo care appears to reduce the pain response to, and recovery from, these frequent procedures, although few studies could be combined to provide strong evidence. As far as it has been reported, skin-to-skin care is safe. Although it appears that skin-to-skin care is effective, the size of the benefit remains uncertain. The quality of evidence in these studies was generally low for the response to the actual procedure but was moderate for recovery from the procedure.
Two recent trials of protein containing synthetic surfactant compared to animal derived surfactant preparations have demonstrated a trend towards decreasing death and decreasing rates of bowel disease (necrotizing enterocolitis), while other clinical outcomes were similar. Further studies will help refine recommendations concerning use of protein containing synthetic surfactants.
This review found evidence that giving all preterm infants (especially very preterm infants) indomethacin on the first day after birth reduced their risk of developing a PDA and the complications associated with PDA (including brain damage due to bleeding into the brain). However, despite these short term effects, the trials found evidence that indomethacin does not increase survival or reduce disability in the longer term.
The evidence is current up to 13 June 2014. We found 20 relevant randomized controlled trials with 1401 participants undergoing surgical procedures with general anaesthesia. These studies compared an α-2 agonist (either clonidine or dexmedetomidine) with a control. The doses, methods, and time that the drugs were given varied between studies. All studies reported results for shivering. Our analysis showed that α-2 agonists significantly reduce the risk of postoperative shivering when administered before or during surgery. However, our analysis also showed that there were significant differences between studies that we could not explain. Some study authors had also presented results for core temperature, length of stay in the recovery room, and clinical side effects of the drugs. Seven studies reported that participants given dexmedetomidine were more likely to have a higher level of sedation after surgery, and five studies reported that participants given dexmedetomidine were more likely to have bradycardia (slower heart rate). We did not combine these results in an analysis. None of the studies presented patient-reported outcomes. We felt that the quality of the evidence was low and that some authors did not make enough of an effort to reduce the risk of bias in the methods, which could affect their results. For example, not all authors masked the anaesthetist or surgeon to which drug was given to each participant. This, along with some unexplained differences between studies and some concern about whether we could have missed some relevant results that had not been published, led us to assess the quality of the evidence for shivering as very low. We used GRADEpro software to assess evidence quality. Alpha-2 agonists may reduce the number of people who shiver after surgical procedures, but they are likely to make people sleepier as a side effect. However, the evidence is from studies of very low quality.
This review assessed data from fifty-one studies and found that paracetamol provided effective pain relief for about half of participants experiencing moderate to severe pain after an operation, including dental surgery for a period of about four hours. There were no clear differences between doses of paracetamol typically used. These single dose studies did not associate paracetamol with any serious side effects.
Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the feet that is easily spread and difficult to get rid of. This review compared different oral antifungal drugs (i.e. drugs taken by mouth), and it included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. There are several different kinds of oral treatments, and the trials we found considered all the oral drugs used to treat athlete's foot. We found terbinafine and itraconazole to be more effective than placebo. And we found terbinafine to be more effective than griseofulvin. Griseofulvin is a treatment that was developed much earlier than the new treatments, such as terbinafine and itraconazole; these newer treatments tend to be most evaluated. Trials of other drugs were not large enough to show differences between them. All drugs had side-effects; gastrointestinal effects were the most common.
In future clinical trials, larger numbers of participants are needed to test different treatments in order to produce more reliable data. Also, future research should consider the costs of the different treatment approaches.
In this review, the authors sought studies that evaluated these measures, but could not find any. Therefore, the authors recommend that appropriate studies be performed in the future to answer this important question that may save lives and costs.
In April 2016 we searched for reports of clinical trials that used cannabis products to treat symptoms in adults with fibromyalgia. We found two small, moderate quality studies, of four and six weeks long, including 72 participants. Both studies tested nabilone, a synthetic (man-made) cannabis product, comparing it with placebo (a dummy pill) or amitriptyline (an antidepressant frequently used in the treatment of fibromyalgia).
Nabilone did not convincingly relieve fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, sleep, fatigue) better than placebo or amitriptyline (very low quality evidence). Compared with placebo and amitriptyline, more people experienced side effects and left the study due to side effects (very low quality evidence). There were no serious side effects reported. We found no relevant study with herbal cannabis, plant-based cannabinoids or other synthetic cannabinoids than nabilone in fibromyalgia.
There was not enough high quality evidence available to draw any robust conclusions. We found no studies on medical cannabis in fibromyalgia.
Some studies have suggested that oxcarbazepine, an anti-convulsant, may have a role in preventing episode recurrence in bipolar affective disorder. This systematic review investigated the efficacy and acceptability of oxcarbazepine compared to placebo and other agents in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Two randomised controlled trials were found that met the methodological inclusion criteria. However, in both cases, data were reported with insufficient clarity to be confidently extracted for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Currently, there is insufficient evidence on which to base any recommendations on the use of oxcarbazepine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar illness, either in monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment. There is need for good quality randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy and acceptability of oxcarbazepine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.
We wanted to identify whether antibiotics are better than placebo (sham or dummy treatment), or no treatment, for children with OME.
We also wanted to see whether there are any unwanted effects associated with taking antibiotics for this condition. We searched for studies that compared oral antibiotic treatment with either placebo or no treatment in children with OME. We compared and summarised the study results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 19 studies involving over 2500 children. Many different types of oral antibiotics were used and the duration of treatment varied a lot between the studies.
It is unclear whether antibiotics have any effect on hearing, as the evidence was not robust.
When compared to no treatment, antibiotics might slightly reduce the number of children who have OME after three months of follow-up. Only two studies looked at the number of children with OME after a longer follow-up time, so we are uncertain whether this is a long-lasting effect, as OME may recur.
We do not know if treatment with antibiotics has any effect on quality of life as none of the studies included in this review assessed this outcome. We were unable to find much evidence on the occurrence of anaphylaxis - a rare but very serious allergic reaction. None of the studies reported that any children suffered from anaphylaxis, but this may be because no one had a reaction, or simply because the studies did not report this. As the evidence included in this Cochrane Review was uncertain, we cannot be sure if treatment with antibiotics gives any benefit to children with OME. As most of the studies were very short in duration, we do not know if any effect of antibiotics would continue over longer time periods - even if OME appears to get better in the short term, it may recur. The evidence is up-to-date to January 2023.
In October 2015, we searched the medical literature and found 23 studies involving 8079 participants looking at paracetamol for frequent episodic tension-type headache. About 6000 participants were involved in comparisons between paracetamol 1000 mg and placebo (a dummy tablet). Results were usually reported two hours after taking the medicine or placebo. The International Headache Society recommends the outcome of being pain free two hours after taking a medicine, but other outcomes are also suggested. Few studies reported pain free at two hours or other outcomes, so there was limited information to analyse for some outcomes. The outcome of being pain free at two hours was reported by 24 in 100 people taking paracetamol 1000 mg, and in 19 out of 100 people taking placebo, meaning that only 5 in 100 people benefited because of paracetamol 1000 mg (high quality evidence). The outcome of being pain free or having only mild pain at two hours was reported by 59 in 100 people taking paracetamol 1000 mg, and in 49 out of 100 people taking placebo (high quality evidence), meaning that only 10 in 100 people benefited because of paracetamol 1000 mg.
About 10 in 100 people taking paracetamol 1000 mg reported having a side effect, which was the same as with placebo (9 in 100 people) (high quality evidence). Most side effects were mild or moderate in intensity. No side effects were serious.
We found a very small amount of information comparing paracetamol 500 mg or 650 mg with placebo, and comparing paracetamol 1000 mg with other painkillers. There was no difference between any of these treatments. The quality of the evidence was moderate or high for paracetamol 1000 mg compared with placebo, and low or very low for paracetamol 500 mg to 650 mg compared with placebo, and for paracetamol 1000 mg compared with other painkillers. High quality evidence means that we are very certain about the results. Low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results.
The search is up-to-date to 1 August 2017. We identified 14 clinical trials including 2966 men. We compared desmopressin alone or in combination with other medicines used for urinary problems (such as alpha-blockers or anticholinergics) against placebo (pretend treatment), behaviour changes, or medicines used for urinary problems alone or in combination. Most of the included studies enrolled only older men. Treatment with desmopressin for three to 12 months may reduce how often men urinate at night in a small number of men compared to placebo. Serious side effects were not increased. We do not know how the use of desmopressin compares to changes in behaviour. The effect of desmopressin on how often men urinate at night is likely to be similar to that of alpha-blockers when given for up to three months (i.e. short-term treatment) without major side effects. Adding desmopressin to an alpha-blocker seems to work little better than an alpha-blocker alone or an alpha-blocker combined with an anticholinergic. We rated the quality of the evidence to be low in most cases, meaning that we cannot fully trust the results. The included studies were poorly designed, small, and only followed people for a short time (usually three months or less).
In May 2016, we searched for clinical trials in which antipsychotics were used to treat symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults. We found a total of four studies with 298 participants. We found three studies with 208 participants, which were eight and 12 weeks long and compared quetiapine, an antipsychotic, against a fake medication (placebo). One hundred and sixty-six participants were diagnosed with major depression. We also found one study comprising 90 patients that compared quetiapine to an antidepressant named amitriptyline, which is frequently used in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Five people in this study were diagnosed with major depression. Quetiapine was not better than a fake medication in achieving a pain reduction of 50% or more (very low quality evidence). Quetiapine was better than the fake medication in achieving a pain reduction of 30% or more, reducing sleep problems, and improving depressed mood and anxiety (very low quality evidence). Quetiapine was better than the fake medication in improving health-related quality of life. Fewer participants dropped out of the trial due to lack of efficacy with quetiapine than with fake medication (very low quality evidence). There was no difference in tolerability and safety between quetiapine and a fake medication (very low quality evidence). For some people, quetiapine led to substantial weight gain and somnolence (sleepiness).
Quetiapine and amitriptyline (an antidepressant which is frequently used to improve sleep and reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia) did not differ in the reduction of average scores for pain, fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety and for limitations of health-related quality of life. Both drugs did not differ in the proportion of patients reporting dizziness, somnolence and weight gain as a side effect (low quality evidence). Compared with amitriptyline, more people experienced side effects and left the study due to side effects with quetiapine (low quality evidence). No serious side effects with either drug were reported (low quality evidence).
We found no relevant study with other antipsychotics than quetiapine in fibromyalgia.
Endometriosis is a painful condition in which endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. It potentially affects a woman's ability to conceive. Recent studies support the contributing role of inflammation in endometriosis-related pain. Since anti-TNF-α drugs can inhibit the inflammation process, they may relieve the symptoms of the disease without inhibiting ovulation. However, this systematic review included one randomised controlled trial and found that there was not enough evidence from which to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of anti-TNF-α drugs in relieving pain in women with endometriosis. There was no evidence of an increase in adverse events in the anti-TNF-α drugs group compared with the placebo group.
We found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) addressing each question. We did not find any new trials for this update.
A 1982 US study compared daily prednisone tablets for 12 weeks with no treatment. Thirty-five people took part. Fourteen participants received prednisone (10 male and four female, with a median age of 46.5 years) and 14 did not receive prednisone (nine male and five female, with a median age of 50 years). Those taking part and the trialists were aware of which treatment the participants received (i.e. they were not 'blinded'), which carries a risk of bias.
The second study compared two six-month corticosteroid treatment regimens: daily standard-dose prednisolone tablets, and high-dose dexamethasone tablets for four days each month. Multiple European centres did the trial, which reported its findings in 2010. Forty-one people took part but one person withdrew after one day because they did not want to continue and the diagnosis was wrong. Of those who continued, 24 (18 men and six women, average age 59.9 years) received monthly dexamethasone and 16 (10 men and six women, average age 60.8 years) received daily prednisolone.
There was no commercial support for either study. Funding for both came from an academic centre or charitable funds. Neither included study reported our preferred primary outcome, which was a disability score.
After 12 weeks, in the trial of prednisone compared to no treatment, 12 of 19 participants on prednisone improved compared with five of 16 participants not on prednisone, based on measurement of disease severity by neurologists. Thus, improvement was about twice as common with prednisone. The small numbers in the trial and its limitations meant that even with this difference we are very uncertain about the size of any effect of prednisone. The trial authors did not report side effects in detail, but one person who received prednisone died. Corticosteroids are commonly used for CIDP in practice, based on favourable reports from non-randomised studies. Corticosteroids are well known to cause side effects, especially when people take large doses for a long time.
In the RCT comparing two corticosteroid regimens, 10 of 24 people on monthly dexamethasone and six of 16 people on daily prednisolone were well and off treatment after a year, which indicates effects that are probably similar. Changes in grip strength and scores of muscle strength were also probably similar between the treatment groups. Monthly dexamethasone and daily prednisolone had similar side effects to one another, except that with high-dose monthly dexamethasone, sleeplessness may be less common and a moon-shaped facial appearance is probably less common. The benefit and harm from prednisone in CIDP is uncertain. The quality of evidence is very low because only one small randomised trial with a high risk of bias is available.
Monthly dexamethasone and daily prednisolone may be of similar benefit in CIDP, but monthly dexamethasone may have fewer side effects. The evidence is up to date to 8 November 2016.
We wanted to find out if vitamin D, taken together with antibiotics, can help children to recover from an episode of pneumonia. We searched for trials that looked at vitamin D compared with placebo (dummy treatment) in children aged between one month and five years who had pneumonia. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included seven trials involving 1601 children from low- and middle-income countries. In five trials, children received a single large dose of vitamin D when they joined the trial or within 24 hours of admission to hospital. In two trials, children received vitamin D for five days. One trial excluded children with normal vitamin D levels. Two trials reported the cause of children's pneumonia. Vitamin D probably has little or no effect on the time it takes children to get better from pneumonia. We do not know if vitamin D has an effect on the time children spend in hospital or the number of children who die. The studies reported no major harmful events. We have only moderate confidence in the evidence on the time it took children to recover from pneumonia, because all children in this comparison were from low-income regions, so the results may not apply to higher-income populations. We have little confidence in the evidence on death rate, because of the same applicability problem outlined above, and because the result was compatible with both appreciable benefit and harm. We have very little confidence in the evidence on time spent in hospital, because of the same applicability problem outlined above, because the children and health providers in one study knew what the allocated treatment was, and because the results were very inconsistent across the studies included in the comparison. The evidence is current to 28 December 2021.
We included four studies in our review (278 participants). The studies were conducted between 2003 and 2010. Although all four included studies were randomized, some elements of their methodology suggest a low to unclear risk of bias in all trials. We found that propofol did not reduce measured overall blood loss in either children or adults (2 studies; 158 participants). Propofol might improve the quality of the surgical field a little (4 studies; 277 participants), but there was no difference in operation time (3 studies; 214 participants). Propofol was more reliable in achieving induced hypotension (1 study; 88 participants). No studies reported any adverse effects from induced hypotension with propofol. We found only four studies, which included a small total number of participants. The evidence from the studies were of moderate to very low quality, and therefore our results should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to confirm whether any important benefit is associated with the use of propofol.
The review authors could not find any randomised controlled trials of spinal immobilisation strategies in trauma patients. It is feasible to have trials comparing the different spinal immobilisation strategies. From studies of healthy volunteers it has been suggested that patients who are conscious, might reposition themselves to relieve the discomfort caused by immobilisation, which could theoretically worsen any existing spinal injuries.
The review authors identified two good quality controlled trials that randomized 287 children aged one day to 16 years to either a heparin-bonded catheter or a standard catheter. The median duration of time that the catheter could be used to give fluids (its patency) was not clearly different with the two types of catheter. This was seven days in the heparin-bonded catheter group and six days in the standard catheter group. There was a no difference between the two groups for risk of catheter-related thrombosis over the time the catheter was in. There was a trend towards a reduction in the risk of catheter occlusion in the first week after catheter placement, reported in one study only.
The risks of catheter-related blood stream infections and bacterial colonization of the catheter were significantly reduced using the heparin-bonded catheter, with a longer time to develop infection (delayed in the heparin-bonded catheter group); however, it was reported in one study only and the strength of evidence was low. There was no significant difference in risk of thrombocytopenia after catheter placement.
Ursodeoxycholic acid is the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for primary biliary cirrhosis, but the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid remain controversial. This review contains updated evidence and re-evaluates beneficial and harmful effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The review includes 16 randomised clinical trials with a total of only 1447 patients. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, all-cause mortality or liver transplantation, adverse events, and quality of life. Although ursodeoxycholic acid indicated a reduction in liver biochemistry, jaundice, and histological progression, this review did not demonstrate any benefits of ursodeoxycholic acid on all-cause mortality, all-cause mortality or liver transplantation, or symptoms (pruritus and fatigue). The use of ursodeoxycholic acid is associated with costs and may cause adverse events. All but one of the trials had high risk of bias and the trials seem to have selective reporting of outcomes.
In this Cochrane review, the review authors compared children given intermittent anti-TB treatment to those given daily treatment. They examined the evidence up to 30 May 2013 and included four randomized trials that compared twice-weekly treatment with daily doses of anti-TB drugs, but none evaluated thrice-weekly dosing. The four trials included 563 children aged five months to 15 years, not known to be resistant to TB drugs. The trials were published over 12 years ago and the regimens used are not those currently recommended.
The trials were small, and did not detect a difference between twice-weekly or daily treatment in the number of children who were cured, died, relapsed, reported taking most or all of the drugs, or had adverse effects. Whether regimens of drugs two or three times a week are as good as regimens with daily doses remains unclear, as the evidence base to date is small, and the regimens tested are not the same as currently currently recommended drug combinations.
Thirteen research studies were included in this review, and they confirm that those people who were given antibiotics when their PEG tube was inserted were less likely to suffer an infection at the site than those who were not given antibiotics.
This one study included 12 centres (593 patients). Four centres assigned HCV-infected patients to a dedicated haemodialysis machine and eight centres did not. This study reported the incidence of HCV in haemodialysis patients decreased with the use of dedicated machines; however it was not possible to determine the benefits and harms associated with isolation, cost, or mortality from the disease. There is insufficient evidence, but additional studies would help clarify the role of isolation to reduce the transmission of HCV in haemodialysis patients.
We found six studies comparing ciclesonide with either budesonide or fluticasone in 3256 children (aged four to 17 years) with chronic asthma. After three months of treatment with ciclesonide compared to budesonide or fluticasone, no relevant differences could be found on asthma symptoms, exacerbations or side effects. Ciclesonide compared to a double dose of fluticasone was assessed in one study and no differences were found in asthma symptoms, use of rescue medication and adverse effects. However, children receiving ciclesonide experienced more asthma exacerbations than children in the fluticasone group.
The results of this review regarding the efficacy and safety of ciclesonide compared to other ICS are not conclusive. Relatively few studies were found, different inhalers were compared and treatment and follow-up time (12 weeks) was too short for the assessment of relevant outcomes such as exacerbations and growth retardation. Future studies should pay attention to those aspects.
This review looked at whether antibiotics are effective in preventing infection in women having a cesarean section. It also studied the effect of giving the antibiotics before or after the cord is clamped and different kinds of antibiotics. The review found 95 studies involving over 15,000 women. Routine use of antibiotics at cesarean section reduced the risk of wound and womb infections in mothers as well as the risk of serious complications of infections for the mothers by 60% to 70%. This was so whether the cesarean section was planned (elective) or not, and whether the antibiotics were given before or after clamping of the umbilical cord. The evidence to support antibiotic treatment was of moderate quality but often the way the study was done was not described well enough. None of the studies looked properly at possible adverse effects on the baby and so, although there are benefits for the mother, there is some uncertainty about whether there are any important effects on the baby.
First, we searched for randomised controlled studies. These are clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups, to compare the effects of different treatments. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study size and methods, and the consistency of findings across studies. We found 40 studies that involved a total of 5675 people. All the people in the studies received treatment in hospital intensive care units. They required assistance from healthcare staff for their oral hygiene care. Most studies involved adults only, though one study focussed on children and another on newborn babies. The studies took place in a range of countries, including China (10 studies), Brazil (6 studies), the USA (6 studies) and Iran (5 studies).
Studies compared a range of oral health care (such as mouthwashes, gels or toothbrushes) against either:
- a placebo (dummy) treatment;
- usual care; or
- another oral health care treatment.
Here we report the findings for two comparisons:
1) Chlorhexidine (CHX, an antiseptic) in the form of mouthwash or gel, against placebo or usual care (13 studies); and
2) Toothbrushing against no tooth brushing, with or without an antiseptic (8 studies).
CHX against placebo or usual care
The evidence suggests that, compared to placebo or usual care, CHX:
- probably prevents VAP from developing in very ill patients (13 studies);
- probably has little or no effect on the risk of dying (9 studies);
- may make little to no difference to patients’ length of stay in the intensive care unit (5 studies).
We do not know if CHX affects the length of time patients spend on a ventilator, or if it leads to adverse (unwanted) effects. This is because we have too little confidence in the evidence, because studies either:
- reported imprecise or inconsistent results;
- were conducted in ways likely to introduce error into the results; or
- reported too little information.
Toothbrushing against no toothbrushing, with or without an antiseptic
The evidence suggests that, compared to no toothbrushing, toothbrushing may:
- prevent VAP from developing in very ill patients (5 studies);
- have little or no effect on the risk of dying (5 studies);
- make little to no difference to how long people spend on ventilators (4 studies).
We do not know if toothbrushing affects patients’ length of stay in the intensive care unit, or if it leads to adverse effects. This is because we have too little confidence in the evidence, because studies either:
- reported imprecise or inconsistent results; or
- were conducted in ways likely to introduce error into the results. Oral hygiene with CHX probably prevents VAP from developing in very ill patients treated in intensive care units. It probably has little or no effect on patients’ risk of dying, or length of stay in the intensive care unit.
Toothbrushing may prevent VAP from developing in very ill patients treated in intensive care units. It may have little or no effect on patients’ risk of dying, or how long patients spend on a ventilator.
We do not know if CHX or toothbrushing lead to adverse effects, because there is insufficient robust evidence about this. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to February 2020.
We did computer searches for all published randomized trials that compared different methods of cervical preparation before second-trimester D&E and we found six studies that met our criteria. All of the methods compared were different from one another, thus it was not possible to combine data from multiple studies. We looked at how these preparation methods compared with respect to safety, procedure time, need for additional dilation, ability to perform the procedure, and patient and provider acceptability.
We found that all methods reviewed were safe. Certain dilators called laminaria appeared to result in more cervical opening (dilation) than the prostaglandin medications, however no difference was seen between dilators and prostaglandins with respect to safety, length of procedure, or the ability to complete the procedure. We found that when mifepristone, a medication that blocks the action of a hormone called progesterone, was used with a prostaglandin called misoprostol that many women ended up expelling the pregnancy before their desired surgical procedure. Due to this increased rate of expulsions prior to planned D&E, we feel that the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol should not be used for cervical preparation when women are desiring a surgical procedure instead of an induction. We found that one day of cervical preparation is just a good as two days and that same-day cervical preparation appears to be safe in the early part of the second trimester.
We believe that more research is needed in the area of same-day cervical preparation as it is much easier for women to have a one-day instead of a multiple day procedure. We also think more research is needed in the area of combining prostaglandins with dilators as this may improve the possibility of conducting same-day procedures later into the second trimester.
We searched databases from their inception to August 2018 and found five studies that met the inclusion criteria. Three studies compared extended-field RT versus pelvic RT. None of these three studies compared against the current gold-standard of pelvic CRT. One study compared extended-field RT versus pelvic CRT and one study compared extended-field CRT versus pelvic CRT. Compared with pelvic RT alone, women given extended-field RT may have been less likely to die and probably were less likely to have a cervical cancer come back (recurrence) in the para-aortic lymph nodes. However, extended-field RT may have made little or no difference to how often their cancer recurred elsewhere and how often they experience severe side effects.
Pelvic CRT is the modern standard of treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. In a comparison of extended-field RT alone versus pelvic CRT, women given pelvic CRT were probably less likely to die or have recurrence of their cancer. Women given extended-field RT alone may have been less likely to experience a recurrence within the para-aortic lymph nodes and have had adverse events during or shortly after treatment. There were no clear differences regarding the late adverse events between the two groups.
Women given extended-field CRT may or may not have been less likely to die or have cancer progression than those women pelvic CRT. There were no clear differences in the chances of experiencing a cancer recurrence in the para-aortic lymph nodes and severe side effects between the groups. The evidence for outcomes in the comparison of extended-field RT alone versus pelvic RT alone were of moderate certainty. In the comparison of extended-field RT versus pelvic CRT, the evidence regarding the survival and side effects were of moderate certainty. The evidence for para-aortic recurrence was of low certainty. The evidence for all outcomes in a comparison of extended-field CRT versus pelvic CRT were of very-low certainty because of concerns regarding the high risk of bias and results coming from a single trial of very few women. We are moderately certain that, compared with pelvic RT alone, extended-field RT probably improves overall survival and reduces risk of para-aortic lymph node recurrence. However, pelvic RT alone would now not be considered the standard of care in women well enough to receive CRT, so these results should be reviewed with caution and cannot be extrapolated to modern treatment techniques.
Low- to moderate-certainty evidence supports the use of pelvic CRT rather than extended-field RT alone, as it appears to reduce the risk of death and cancer progression. The likelihood of experiencing unwanted side effects during treatment was higher among women receiving pelvic CRT than extended-field RT. Evidence comparing extended-field CRT to pelvic CRT was very low certainty regarding outcomes and it may or may not improve survival.
We included five studies with 3343 participants. All studies included a small number of participants, including children with a high risk of adverse outcomes if infected with RSV due to underlying health issues, such as premature birth or heart or pulmonary problems. Most studies did not specify their funding sources. One study was funded by Abbott Laboratories and by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection by 56%; based on 98 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality, and little to no difference in adverse events; based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants and 84 adverse events per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 deaths per 1000 participants and 81  adverse events per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory illness by 22% but may result in little to no difference in length of hospital stay. It may reduce RSV infection rate by 67% at two years’ follow-up. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days by 61% but may result in little to no difference in days using oxygen, length of stay in the intensive care unit, or mechanical ventilation days. The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate to high.
No randomised controlled trials have examined this topic. Randomised controlled trials are the best studies for finding out whether one treatment is better or worse than another because they ensure that similar types of people are receiving the treatments being assessed. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we sought information from non-randomised studies. We identified 12 non-randomised studies that compared laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy in a total of 1576 patients. One of these studies did not provide results in a useable way. Thus, we included 11 studies in which a total of 1506 patients underwent distal pancreatectomy. Some 353 patients underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, and 1153 patients underwent open distal pancreatectomy. In all studies, historical information was collected from hospital records (retrospective studies). In general, historical information is less reliable than newly collected (prospective) information and findings of randomised controlled trials. Differences in short-term deaths, long-term deaths, percentage of people with major complications, percentage of people with a pancreatic fistula (abnormal communication between the pancreas and other organs or the skin), recurrence of cancer at final time of follow-up of participants, percentage of people with any complications and percentage of patients in whom cancer was not completely removed were imprecise. Average length of hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group than in the open group by about two days. However, this is not relevant until we can be sure that cancer cures are similar between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery. No studies have reported quality of life at any point in time, short-term recurrence of cancer, time to return to normal activity, time to return to work or blood transfusion requirements. The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly because it was not clear whether similar types of participants received laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy. In many studies, people with less extensive cancer received laparoscopic surgery, and those with more extensive cancer received open surgery. This makes study findings unreliable. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are necessary if we are to obtain good quality evidence on this topic.
The review included four small studies with a total of 86 participants. Each study investigated a different treatment. These were a drug treatment (modafinil) compared to placebo, breathing exercises compared to sham (inactive) breathing exercises, exercises with weights compared to usual care, and magnetic brain stimulation compared to sham rTMS. We are very uncertain about the effects of modafinil, breathing exercises, exercises with weights, or magnetic brain stimulation on fatigue in people with ALS/MND, as the evidence was very low quality. It was often unclear whether studies were adequately designed and performed, as trial reports often lacked details. The results of these small studies were not precise. Three participants stopped taking modafinil because of side effects: headache in two, and chest tightness in one; participants also reported anxiety, nausea, dizziness, and sialorrhoea (inability to control oral secretions). We need more research on effective treatments for fatigue in ALS/MND.
The searches are up to date to September 2017.
This review is based on a search for trials carried out in July 2012, and includes 10 studies with 686 participants. The aim was to determine the effects of trifluoperazine for schizophrenia when compared with placebo (a ‘dummy’ treatment). As expected, people given trifluoperazine showed a significant improvement compared to placebo in both the short and medium term, reinforcing the use of this well-established typical antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia. However, trifluoperazine can cause side effects such as confusion, agitation, having a dry mouth and blurred vision, but causes less sedation and dizzy spells, so is generally well tolerated by people with schizophrenia.
The authors of the review conclude that trifluoperazine has similar effectiveness to other common antipsychotic drugs, although it may cause more side effects. Evidence used in the review was also graded as low or very low quality. In the light of this, use of other antipsychotic drugs should be considered before starting on trifluoperazine. Most of the included studies were conducted roughly 40 years ago so new, large, comprehensive and independent research trials are needed.

We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in older adults with dementia. We classified antidepressants based on their mechanism of action and included studies that compared antidepressants to treatment with either placebo or other medications frequently used to manage these symptoms. A total of nine studies (including 692 individuals) were identified, four comparing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to placebo, three comparing SSRIs to typical antipsychotics, and one study comparing SSRIs to atypical antipsychotics. One study compared the antidepressant trazodone to placebo, and two compared trazodone to haloperidol. Most of the studies included in the review were relatively small and of uncertain risk of bias due to methodological issues. The SSRIs sertraline and citalopram were associated with a modest reduction in symptoms of agitation and psychosis when compared to placebo in two studies. There were few other statistically significant differences in changes in agitation or psychosis or in most measures of medication tolerability for SSRIs or trazodone when compared to placebo or the antipsychotic haloperidol. We conclude that there is some evidence to support the use of certain antidepressants for agitation and psychosis in dementia and further studies are required to determine the effectiveness and safety of SSRIs and trazodone in managing these symptoms.
In the original review published in August 2014, we searched four literature databases, which are used to identify articles from peer-reviewed journals and other types of periodicals. Six randomised controlled trials, in which people were randomly assigned to the intervention or a comparison group (control group), were eligible for inclusion. Each trial assessed different interventions, so results were not combined. The largest trial investigated the medical drug memantine in 508 people with a metastatic brain tumour. Another trial investigated donepezil in 198 patients with a primary or secondary brain tumour. The other trials were smaller and investigated modafinil and methylphenidate. We found one psychological intervention for preventing cognitive deficits during brain radiation.
In this update, we searched the same databases as in the original review. Two new studies were included in the review. One of these was a non-pharmacological prevention study investigating the effect of a calorie-restricted ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. The other identified study was a non-pharmacological amelioration study evaluating Goal Management Training, a behavioural intervention that combined mindfulness and strategy training. An additional paper included in the review was the full-text article of a conference proceeding included in the original review, which investigated donepezil compared with placebo. Findings into the efficacy of memantine offer preliminary supportive evidence for preventing cognitive deficits in patients with a secondary brain tumour receiving brain irradiation. Findings into the efficacy of donepezil offer some initial support for its use in the amelioration of cognitive deficits in patients with a primary or secondary tumour previously treated with radiation. Further research into both drugs is important to confirm their effectiveness as well as any potential side effects. The remaining studies did not have a sufficient number of participants to provide reliable results. Side effects (adverse events) were not reported in all studies, but in studies where they were, they were most often infrequent and not severe. Recruitment and retention of trial participants for most of the pharmacological studies was difficult. Lastly, although limited support was found for non-pharmacological treatments, this does not suggest these interventions are ineffective but rather that further research is needed. We found limitations in the certainty of the evidence across studies. Several of the pharmacological randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias, although some were at high risk of bias due to, for example, an open-label design or the lack of a placebo group. The non-pharmacological interventions were at a high risk of bias as a placebo condition in these trials is difficult to employ.
The review authors identified four trials, with 116 participants, investigating the effectiveness of compressing therapies for PTS (most recent search 2 July 2018). Two trials studied the effect of GECS. One study showed an improvement of PTS symptoms and one showed no benefit. Two other trials studied the effect of an intermittent pneumatic compression device. Both reported an improvement in PTS severity. One study evaluated side effects and quality of life. Although 9% of the participants experienced side effects such as leg swelling, irritation, superficial bleeding, and skin itching, quality of life had positive outcomes. None of the studies assessed or reported on patient satisfaction or compliance rates. The evidence for use of GECS or intermittent pneumatic compression device compared to control for the treatment of PTS severity is of very-low and low-certainty reliability. This is due to conflicting results, small studies of short duration, and differences in how the studies measured outcomes. Limited evidence was available for side effects, patient satisfaction, quality of life, and compliance.
Although early cord clamping has been thought to reduce the risk of bleeding after birth (postpartum haemorrhage), this review of 15 randomised trials involving a total of 3911 women and infant pairs showed no significant difference in postpartum haemorrhage rates when early and late cord clamping (generally between one and three minutes) were compared. There were, however, some potentially important advantages of delayed cord clamping in healthy term infants, such as higher birthweight, early haemoglobin concentration, and increased iron reserves up to six months after birth. These need to be balanced against a small additional risk of jaundice in newborns that requires phototherapy.
We wanted to assess how accurate the red flags used to screen for spinal fracture are in people presenting with low back pain. Where possible, we reported results of red flags separately for the different types of spinal fracture, such as osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (e.g. fractures due to osteoporosis), vertebral traumatic fracture (e.g. due to falls), vertebral stress fracture (e.g. rapid increase in load on the spine), or unspecified vertebral fracture (e.g. no specific cause reported). We updated a previous Cochrane Review. We searched for studies that investigated the accuracy of red flags across different healthcare settings. We included studies that compared results of history taking and physical examination (or both) (known as index tests or red flags) with different types of imaging (known as the reference standard) to identify spinal fractures in people with low back pain. We also included studies if they reported on the results of red flags separately for the different types of spinal fractures. Fourteen studies investigated different red flags used to identify spinal fractures, and most of the red flags were not accurate or useful. Overall, the four best red flags found were corticosteroid use (e.g. medicines that can weaken bones), person's age (e.g. aged above 70 years), trauma (e.g. a fall), and a contusion (bruising) or abrasion (cuts and grazes).
In the primary healthcare setting (e.g. general practitioners), 'trauma' as a red flag was best to screen for 'unspecified spinal fracture' and 'osteoporotic spinal fracture'. 'Older age' as a red flag was best to screen for 'unspecified spinal fracture' in primary care. 'Corticosteroid use' may be useful as a red flag in primary care to screen for 'unspecified spinal fracture' and 'osteoporotic spinal fracture'. Red flags as part of a combination of index tests such as 'older age and female gender' as a red flag in primary care is best to screen for 'unspecified spinal fracture'.
In the secondary healthcare setting (e.g. specialists and consultants), 'trauma' as a red flag is best to screen for 'unspecified spinal fracture' and 'older age' for 'osteoporotic spinal fracture'. Red flags as part of a combination of index tests such as 'older age and trauma' in secondary care as a red flag is best to screen for 'unspecified spinal fracture'. When 'four of five tests' are positive in secondary care as a red flag, it may be used to screen for 'osteoporotic spinal fracture'.
In the tertiary care setting (e.g. specialised care in a hospital setting), the 'presence of contusion/abrasion' as a red flag was best to screen for 'spinal compression fracture'. A limitation of our review is that most of the included studies were different in terms of the healthcare setting they were performed in, used different study designs, or presented data for different types of spinal fracture, which made drawing conclusions difficult. Many of the red flags investigated were from single studies and few studies investigated the same index tests. There was also little uniform agreement on the definition of red flags (e.g. for corticosteroids, it was not clear how long and how much was used), which may explain why the accuracy of some red flags varied from study to study. Some red flags may also affect different types of spinal fractures differently; however, this was not clearly reported in most cases. The evidence is up to date to July 2022.
In October 2017, we searched a list of literature databases and conference proceedings to identify studies that evaluated treatments for brain radionecrosis. A total of three studies were identified that evaluated drugs of which only two were RCTs and one of these RCTs had only 14 participants. No studies evaluating non-drug treatments were identified. The two drugs compared to corticosteroids alone in this review were bevacizumab (a drug affecting the blood vessels) and edaravone (a powerful antioxidant).
A very small-sized study reported that bevacizumab improved the appearance of the radionecrosis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This was associated with improvement in neurological symptoms than placebo but also with severe side effects.
Edaravone in combination with corticosteroids improved the appearance of radionecrosis on MRI; this was associated with improvement in the reported symptoms using the LENT/SOMA scale. However, the patient and treating team were aware of the particular treatment the patient was receiving, so the reported symptoms may have been influenced by this.
None of the included studies reported quality of life outcomes or adequately reported details about corticosteroid requirements.
Finally a two arm non-randomised study of vitamin E versus no active treatment based on patient preference reported improvement in learning and memory, but this study did not report any imaging response. The results may have been influenced as patients chose their study treatment thus introducing other potential biases. Based on the findings of this review the certainty of the available evidence is low/very low, which limits our ability to help determine the risks and benefits of the evaluated treatments for brain radionecrosis. The studies were at risk of bias due to aspects of their study designs and/or very limited number of participants. There is a great need for higher-quality evidence with larger multi-centre randomised control trials of treatments for brain radionecrosis. In our search of the literature for this review, two ongoing RCTs, one evaluating bevacizumab and one evaluating hyperbaric oxygen therapy were identified.
We searched scientific databases to find all published and unpublished studies of STPP compared with wait-list control, treatment as usual or minimal treatment up to July 2012. We searched for studies in adults over 17 years of age with common mental disorders being treated in an outpatient setting. We excluded people with psychotic disorders. We included 33 studies involving 2173 people. When the results of the studies were combined and analysed, we found that there was a significantly greater improvement in the groups of people who received STPP versus the control groups, both in the short-term (less than three months after treatment) and medium-term (three to six months after treatment). These benefits generally appeared to increase in the long-term. However, some results did not remain statistically significant in the long-term and, in addition, the studies varied in terms of their design, meaning that these conclusions are tentative and need confirmation with further research. The finding that a short-term psychological therapy treatment may be broadly applicable and effective is of importance in the atmosphere of current global healthcare and economic restrictions. The studies were of variable quality.
We found nine studies that addressed this question, assessing six different types of treatment and involving 616 participants. For none of the instillations was the evidence conclusive. It was most promising for BCG (a type of tuberculosis bacterium) and possibly also for oxybutinin (a drug commonly taken orally to stop unwanted bladder contractions). Another agent, Resiniferatoixin, seemed to worsen pain and increase the likelihood of patients stopping treatment early. Little evidence was found for assessing benefits and harms of other treatments instilled into the bladder.
Editorial peer review is used world-wide as a tool to assess and improve the quality of submissions to paper and electronic biomedical journals. As the information revolution gathers pace, an empirically proven method of quality assurance is of paramount importance. The increasing availability of empirical research on the possible effects of peer review led us to carry out a review of current evidence on the efficacy of editorial peer review. We found few studies of reasonable quality, and most of these were concerned with the effects of blinding reviewers and/or authors to each others' identity. We could not identify any methodologically convincing studies assessing the core effects of peer review. Major research is urgently needed.
When epidurals or spinals were used to replace general anaesthesia, the risk of dying during the surgery or within the following 30 days was reduced by approximately 29% (from 20 studies with 3006 participants). Also, the risk of developing pneumonia (chest infection) was reduced by 55% (from five studies with 400 participants). However, the risk of developing a myocardial infarction (heart attack) was the same for both anaesthetic techniques (from six studies with 849 participants).
When epidurals (and less frequently spinals) were used to reduce the quantity of other drugs required while general anaesthesia was used, the risk of dying during the surgery or within 30 days was the same for both anaesthetic techniques (from 18 studies with 3228 participants). Also, a difference was not detected for the risk of developing myocardial infarction (from eight studies with 1580 participants). The risk of developing pneumonia was reduced by approximately 30% when a correction was made for possible missing studies (from nine studies with 2433 participants).
No serious side effects (seizures, cardiac arrest, nerve damage lasting longer than one month or infection) were reported from the use of epidurals or spinals in these studies.
The quality of the evidence for all six comparisons was rated as moderate because of some imperfections in how the studies were carried out. Therefore further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these results and may even change the results.
.
The evidence is current to June 2016. Of the 21 included trials including 1420 participants, 14 trials compared a probiotic with placebo or no treatment and seven trials compared a probiotic with lactulose. The treatment duration of the trials ranged from 10 days to 180 days.
Compared with placebo or no intervention, probiotics probably improve recovery and may lead to improvements in the development of overt hepatic encephalopathy, quality of life, and plasma ammonia concentrations, but may lead to little or no difference in mortality. Probiotics may slightly improve quality of life when compared with no intervention; however, this conclusion is based on three trials with low-quality evidence. Whether probiotics are better than lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy is uncertain because the quality of the available evidence was very low. There were no reports of septicaemia attributable to probiotic in any trial. There was no evidence of more adverse events with probiotics when compared to placebo or lactulose. Eight trials declared their funding source, of which six were independently funded and two were industry funded. The remaining 13 trials did not disclose their funding source. Many of the included trials suffered from a high risk of systematic error (‘bias’) and a high risk of random error (‘play of chance’). Accordingly, we consider the evidence to be of low quality. Compared with placebo or no intervention, probiotics probably improve recovery and may lead to improvements in the development of overt hepatic encephalopathy, quality of life, and plasma ammonia concentrations, but probiotics may lead to little or no difference in mortality. Whether probiotics are better than lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy is uncertain because the quality of the available evidence was very low. High-quality randomised clinical trials with standardised outcome collection and data reporting are needed to further clarify the true efficacy of probiotics.
Randomised studies provide the best quality evidence. We did not find any randomised studies of ephedrine in neonatal myasthenia, autoimmune MG, or the CMSs. Fifty-three non-randomised studies, which provide weaker evidence than randomised studies, have reported the effects of ephedrine on muscle weakness, fatigue, and quality of life. We have described these findings narratively in the Discussion section of the review. Effects may differ depending on the type of myasthenia. Adverse effects that were reported in these studies included palpitations, sleep disturbances, nervousness, and irritability when ephedrine was stopped. We conclude that there is a need for high-quality studies to assess the effects of ephedrine in MG, neonatal myasthenia, and the CMSs.
The evidence is current to November 2014.
This evidence is current to September 2017. We found five studies with a total of 202 participants (both genders). All included participants had moderate-to-severe eczema diagnosed by a specialist doctor. The studies lasted four to eight weeks. The study setting was unclear in two studies, multicentre in two studies, and single centre in one study; the studies were conducted in Europe and Bangladesh. All studies used the LTRA montelukast, at a dose of either 5 mg or 10 mg. Only one study included children (31 participants, age 6 years and older). The age range for the other four studies was 16 to 70 years. LTRA treatment was compared with placebo or conventional treatment, which includes currently used eczema treatments, such as steroid creams. Varied scoring systems were used to calculate the effect of the treatments on participants' eczema. Two included studies were funded by the company that produces montelukast. Limited available data meant we were unable to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of LTRA in eczema. Like other reviews on this topic, this review is unlikely to change how eczema is treated because there is no convincing evidence that montelukast, the only LTRA that could be assessed, is helpful for eczema.
We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast and placebo in terms of improving eczema disease severity (low-quality evidence). When montelukast was compared with conventional treatment, participants using montelukast in one study saw an improvement in disease severity, but no difference was observed in another study. We are uncertain about these results because the quality of the evidence was very low.
None of the studies looked at long-term eczema control, moisturiser (emollients) use, or quality of life.
We found no evidence that montelukast lessened itching or reduced the need for steroid creams during treatment when compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). The studies comparing montelukast with conventional treatments did not assess these outcomes.
Participants in four studies did not experience side effects. In one study comparing montelukast with placebo, there were two reported incidents in the montelukast group that resulted in participant withdrawal: one episode of septicaemia (blood poisoning) and one episode of dizziness. However, it was not clear whether these were related to the montelukast treatment. Other mild side effects were reported (e.g. headache, stomach-related disturbances), but by participants in both groups. We therefore found no evidence of a difference between montelukast and placebo or conventional treatments, but this is assessment is based on low-quality evidence. The quality of evidence was low for all but one key result, that is montelukast’s effect on ‘change (improvement) in disease severity’ when compared with conventional treatment, the evidence for which was considered to be very low quality. Overall, very few studies addressed our review question.
Many outcomes were not assessed, including long-term control, and those that were assessed had relatively few participants, which were mainly adults. The studies focused solely on moderate-severe eczema, and there were concerns with the participants or investigators knowing which treatment was received.
A systematic search of the medical literature found two randomized trials of gabapentin compared with placebo (inactive treatment). The same team of scientists performed both trials, which were sponsored by the manufacturer. The trials involved a total of 355 people with ALS. Treatment with gabapentin lasted six and nine months. We found no trials of baclofen or other GABA modulators in ALS that met our selection criteria. We assessed the gabapentin trials as well run and well conducted. Neither of the trials were long enough to for us to report survival at one year. Combined results from the two studies (based on 274 participants) provided high-quality evidence of little or no difference in estimated one-year survival, the rate of decline in respiratory function, or rate of decline in arm strength in people treated with gabapentin compared to those treated with placebo. One trial (128 participants) measured quality of life and monthly decline in function (measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale). There was little or no difference in the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) or quality of life between the gabapentin group and the placebo group.
People who received gabapentin had more light-headedness, drowsiness, and limb swelling than those taking placebo when we combined data from both trials (353 participants). Fatigue and falls occurred more frequently with gabapentin than with placebo in one trial, but when we combined the data for fatigue from both trials, there was no clear difference between the groups.
In conclusion, high-quality evidence indicates that gabapentin does not extend survival or slow the rate of decline of muscle strength or respiratory function. Moderate-quality evidence shows no effect on quality of life or decline in ALSFRS. Other GABA modulators have not been studied in randomized trials.
The evidence is current to August 2016.
We included in our review 557 participants from three studies; 319 received smart technology to support self-management, and 238 received face-to-face verbal/written or digital information and education about self-management. The average age of participants was 64 years. Our review included more men than women because the sample from one study consisted of war veterans, most of whom were men. Participants used the technology for just four weeks in one study to six months in the second and four months in the third, which also reported data at 12 months. Technology used in these studies included smart phones or PCs. People who received smart technology showed greater improvement in self-management and quality of life and increased physical activity compared with people who received face-to-face/digital and/or written support over a four-week to six-month period. Also, hospital admissions and exacerbations of COPD did not differ between those who used smart technology and those who did not. Only one study provided information about people who stopped smoking and reported no differences between groups. We found only three studies all at high risk of bias - that we could include in this review, and we could conduct analysis on only two of our outcomes (quality of life and increased physical activity). As a result, we think that current information does not show clearly whether smart technology is helpful for people with COPD. We recommend further research of high quality that focuses on outcomes relevant to different stages of COPD. Researchers should be clear about how self-management is assessed, should report standard trial outcomes, particularly cost, and should include follow-up for at least one year so they can provide comments on behavioural change and impact of treatment.
The efficacy of nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, has been tested in randomized controlled trials for the treatment of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia, the commonest forms of dementia in older people. The rationale for its use is to restrict the influx of calcium ions into neurons, and, by vasodilatation, to improve blood flow to the brain. This review found evidence of some short-term benefit attributable to nimodipine, mainly in measures of cognitive function and global impression, but not in activities on daily living, for patients with degenerative and multi-infarct dementia, and mixed dementia. Nimodipine is well tolerated with a low rate of adverse effects similar to that associated with placebo.
We included 47 trials with 3581 participants of 18 TCHMs in this review. All were conducted in mainland China between 1997 and 2013 with participant numbers ranging from 26 to 240 and an average study duration of 12 weeks. There were significant problems with the methods in many of the trials, particularly with how participants were allocated to treatments, how outcomes were measured and how thoroughly harmful effects were monitored. For these and other reasons, we rated the overall quality of the evidence as variable, ranging from moderate to very low. This means that we are uncertain, and often very uncertain, about the accuracy of the results.
Despite these reservations, we found seven TCHMs which each had potentially large benefits in studies comparing TCHMs to no treatment or Western Medicine. Three of these – Nao XinTong, NaoMaiTai and TongXinLuo – had the strongest evidence to justify further research. We found that the risk of harmful effects was at least 5% higher than the risk for participants in the control group for NaoMaiTai and TongXinLuo, but the quality of this evidence was poor. We think further research of some TCHMs for vascular dementia is justified, but it is important that the quality of trial conduct and reporting be improved by adhering to published best-practice standards.
We wanted to find out how many trials are being published. We also wanted to find out whether publication and the time taken to publish are influenced by the nature of the results, the size of the trial and the type of organisation responsible for providing the money to run the trial. We searched multiple health-related databases to find studies that examined the publication rate or the time to publication of results of clinical trials. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on the study methods. We found 204 studies, published between 1992 and 2023, which included 165,135 trials.
The studies showed that just over half (53%) of all trials had published their results in a journal. The studies also showed that trials were more likely to be published if their results were positive, they were large (involving a lot of people), there were carried out in multiple places ('sites') and they were funded by a non-commercial organisation. The time taken to publish was shorter for trials with positive results or a large sample size or if they were funded by a non-commercial organisation.
This evidence has important implications for when we should conduct systematic reviews and the best time to update them, especially if systematic reviews do not make efforts to include unpublished evidence. It is of particular concern for reviews containing only a small number of studies. The studies we included in this review varied in their methods, the type of trials they examined and their quality. In the review, we acknowledge and discuss these issues, and we provide separate analyses for trials of different types and quality. The evidence is based on searches carried out in August 2023.
We found five randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 201 participants. Most trials did not report on type of diabetes. Younger diabetic participants and children were underrepresented in our included trials (one trial only). Participants in four trials received treatment with insulin lispro, and one trial with 45 participants investigated insulin aspart. The average follow-up as measured by mean hospital stay ranged between two and seven days. The study authors termed the diabetic ketoacidosis being treated with insulin analogues or regular insulin as mild or moderate. This evidence is up to date as of October 2015. Our results are most relevant for adults with mild or moderate diabetic ketoacidosis due to undertreatment of diabetes. No deaths occurred. Time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis from the start of therapy did not differ substantially between the two insulin treatment schemes (approximately 11 hours). Hypoglycaemic (low blood sugar) episodes were comparable: 118 per 1000 participants for intravenous insulin compared with 70 per 1000 participants for subcutaneous insulin lispro (no statistically significant difference). The mean length of hospital stay also showed no marked differences. No trial reported on side effects other than hypoglycaemic episodes or investigated patient satisfaction. No serious events associated with diabetic ketoacidosis were seen during insulin lispro treatment. Our results were limited by mostly low- to very low-quality evidence, mainly because the number of included trials and participants was low. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our findings.
We identified 29 trials involving 5902 participants (search completed 2 April 2019). Participants who were recruited had had a recent stroke and required admission to hospital. Organised inpatient (stroke unit) care was provided in a variety of ways including stroke ward (care provided in a discrete stroke ward), mixed rehabilitation ward (setting seeking to improve care for people with stroke within a mixed rehabilitation ward), and mobile stroke team (peripatetic team looking after people with stroke across a range of wards). At an average of 12 months after their stroke, people who received organised inpatient (stroke unit) care were more likely to be alive (an extra two people surviving for every 100 receiving stroke unit care; moderate-quality evidence) and living at home (an extra six patients for every 100 receiving stroke unit care; moderate-quality evidence). They also were more likely to be independent in daily activities (an extra six patients for every 100 receiving stroke unit care; moderate-quality evidence). The apparent benefits were seen in men and women, older and younger patients, and people with different types of stroke and different stroke severity. Benefits were most obvious when the stroke unit was based in a discrete stroke ward. We downgraded the quality of evidence to 'moderate' for the main outcomes because it was impossible to hide the treating service from participants or healthcare workers. These conclusions were not dependent on trials judged to be of lower quality because of poor design or missing data. More information was missing for some of the other outcome measures and analyses, which we have downgraded to low-quality evidence. People with stroke who receive organised inpatient (stroke unit) care are more likely to be alive, living at home, and independent in looking after themselves one year after their stroke. Apparent benefits were seen across a broad range of people with stroke. Various types of stroke units have been developed. The best results appear to come from stroke units based in a dedicated stroke ward.
We included studies that compared entropy monitoring to the standard practice of administering anaesthetic drugs according to changes in heart rate, blood pressure, tearing, sweating or movement in response to surgery. The evidence is current to September 2014. We included adults and children aged two to 16 years. The participants underwent all types of surgery, except brain surgery, under general anaesthesia. We reran the search in January 2016. We identified one potential new study of interest; we will incorporate it into the formal review findings during the review update. We found 11 studies, with a total of 962 participants.
Six studies (383 participants) found minimally shorter time to awakening in the entropy group. No study reported on death occurring in the first 24 hours after surgery or within 30 days to a year after surgery.
Eight studies (797 participants) evaluated recollection of intraoperative events (awareness). Adverse events were rare and no benefit was evident.
All 11 studies compared anaesthetic medicine use: six compared propofol (given in the vein) and five evaluated anaesthetic gas (sevoflurane or isoflurane). Limited studies were analysed because of differences in methodology and units of measurement. Analysis of three studies (166 participants) found reduced propofol use, and two studies (156 participants) found lower sevoflurane use in the entropy group.
No study reported on cost of general anaesthesia. Three studies found shorter length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) in the entropy group. The evidence for assessing reduction in time to awakening, recall of intraoperative events and amount of inhalation of anaesthetic agents used is of moderate quality. The quality of evidence as regards intravenous anaesthetic agent used and length of stay in the PACU is of low quality.
We wanted to find out if giving tranexamic acid was better (or worse) than not giving tranexamic acid. The main outcomes we were interested in were blood transfusions, completeness of stone removal, and the risk of blood clots forming in other parts of the body. We also studied unwanted medication effects, the need for more stone procedures, major and minor surgical complications, unplanned returns to the hospital, and length of stay in the hospital. We searched for all studies in which participants had a percutaneous nephrolithotomy for large stones, and chance determined whether they were given tranexamic acid or no tranexamic acid. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 10 studies that used tranexamic acid as an infusion by vein and one study that added tranexamic acid to the irrigation fluid. Based on these studies, tranexamic acid may reduce blood transfusions and improve stone removal. However, we do not know if tranexamic acid affects blood clots forming in other parts of the body when infused by a vein, or added to the irrigation fluid used for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. We have little confidence in most of the evidence, and for some of the results, we are confident in the evidence. Reasons for low confidence include concerns about whether participants in both groups were managed and evaluated the same way. Also, in some instances, the results of the included studies were quite different, the studies were small, or there were not enough studies to be sure of the effect. The evidence is up-to-date to 11 May 2023.
 .Duration of these studies ranged from three to five years. Drug classes studied included thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. We concluded that most of the evidence demonstrated that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality, stroke, and heart attack. No other drug class improved health outcomes better than low-dose thiazides. Beta-blockers and high-dose thiazides were inferior. High-quality evidence supported that low-dose thiazides should be used first for most patients with elevated blood pressure. Fortunately, thiazides are also very inexpensive. The evidence for first-line low dose thiazides was high quality. For the other classes, we judged the evidence to be moderate or low quality.
This review concludes that single layer anastomosis is comparable to double layer anastomosis in terms of anastomotic leak, peri-operative complications, death rate and hospital stay. Single layer anastomosis consumes shorter operative time as compared to double layer. Therefore, single layer anastomosis may routinely be used for the anastomosis of gastrointestinal tract following bowel resection. However, since this conclusion is derived from smaller number of patients recruited in relatively moderate quality trials, further trials should be aimed to reduce the limitations of this review.
In one of the only randomised trials of antipsychotic medications for treating amphetamine psychosis, Leelahanaj (2005) reported that olanzapine and haloperidol delivered at clinically relevant doses both showed similar efficacy in resolving psychotic symptoms (93% and 79%, respectively), with olanzapine showing significantly greater safety and tolerability than haloperidol as measured by frequency and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms. These outcomes are consistent with treatments for schizophrenia indicating equivalent efficacy between atypical anti-psychotics and conventional anti-psychotics, mostly haloperidol with older drugs causing more severe side effects (Leucht 1999).While anti-psychotic medications demonstrate efficacy in providing short-term relief when a heavy user of amphetamines experiences psychosis, there is no evidence to guide decisions regarding long-term clinical care using these medications for preventing relapse to psychosis.
We first carried out a wide search of medical databases to find studies that met the requirements for this review. We identified three studies, which involved 277 participants who were randomly assigned to different treatments for pain in GBS. Two studies compared a pain medicine (gabapentin or carbamazepine) with placebo (inactive treatment). The other study compared a steroid medicine with placebo. Two medicines, gabapentin and carbamazepine, reduced pain severity compared to placebo (inactive) treatment and they had few side effects. One study found that people taking gabapentin had less pain, sleepiness or need for additional pain killers than those given carbamazepine. However, these studies were small and the treatment period was short. One trial, with 223 participants, found that methylprednisolone, which is a steroid medicine, did not affect the numbers of people who developed pain or change the numbers with more pain or less pain compared with placebo. This study did not report whether there were any side effects.
This review does not provide enough evidence to say whether or not treatments for pain in people with GBS work. Although both gabapentin and carbamazepine reduced the severity of pain compared to placebo, and few side effects were reported, the studies were small and the quality of the evidence was very low. Much larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm that drug treatments are safe and effective for people with pain in the period soon after onset of GBS. Long-term studies of pain treatments at the stage when people with GBS are recovering should also be conducted and these should include assessment of effects of pain treatments on quality of life.
This review was first published in 2013 and an updated search in 2014 revealed no additional studies. The evidence is current to November 2014.
We included in this review 19 trials involving 516 participants. Comparisons included supine position versus prone and different lateral positions (right, left, alternant or quarter for prone). The outcome most often reported in these studies was change in oxygenation. We found no clear evidence that particular body positions in newborn babies who need assisted ventilation are effective in producing relevant and sustained improvement. However, putting infants who receive assisted ventilation in the face-down (prone) position for a short time slightly improves levels of oxygen in the blood (evidence of moderate quality), and these infants undergo fewer episodes of poor oxygenation (evidence of low quality).
Researchers described no adverse effects for any of the positions compared, although studies did not last long enough for investigators to detect all possible effects. What's more, most of the babies participating in the studies were placed in alternate positions. For this reason, medium- or long-term adverse effects cannot be attributed to a given position. Confidence in review conclusions depends on the characteristics of included studies such as risk of bias (design limitations), consistency (heterogeneity across studies), precision (small confidence interval) and directness (same effect), and requires that all included studies were published independently of their outcomes.
The quality of evidence for these outcomes allows us to have very low to moderate confidence in our conclusions.
We found six trials with 1758 participants. Of these, five studies looked at on-demand deprescribing and one trial looked at abruptly stopping PPIs. Participants were aged 48 to 57 years, except for one trial (average age of 73 years). The majority of participants had moderate heart burn and acid reflux with milder forms of esophagitis (inflammation of the food pipe that may lead to damage). We found that deprescribing methods led to worse symptoms control while considerably reducing pill use. Deprescribing PPIs may lead to side effects such as inflammation of the esophagus. Very few data were available to make a conclusion regarding long-term benefits and harms of PPI reduction or discontinuation. Overall, the quality of evidence for this review ranged from very low to moderate. Trials were inconsistent with how they reported symptom control. There were also limitations in how the studies were conducted (e.g. participants and investigators may have known which medicine they received), which lowered the quality of evidence. Other contributing factors included small sample sizes for most trials and inconsistent results between studies.
The review authors searched the literature and were able to combine data from 11 randomized controlled clinical trials (3716 participants) comparing different durations of treatment with VKA in patients with a symptomatic VTE. Participants receiving prolonged treatment had around five times lower risk of recurrence of VTE. On the other hand, they had about three times higher risk of bleeding complications. Prolonged treatment did not reduce the risk of death. Prolonged use of VKA strongly reduced the risk of recurrent clots as long as they were used, but benefit decreased over time and the risk of major bleeding remained.
The researchers extensively searched the literature up to 17 October 2018 and found three studies (93 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. One ongoing study was also identified. All of the studies were small in size and had some quality issues. One small study (21 participants) compared eight weeks of treatment with cannabis cigarettes containing 115 mg of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to placebo cigarettes containing cannabis with the THC removed in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. Although no difference in clinical remission rates was observed, more participants in the cannabis group had improvement in their Crohn's disease symptoms than participants in the placebo group. More side effects were observed in the cannabis cigarette group compared to placebo. These side effects were considered to be mild in nature and included sleepiness, nausea, difficulty with concentration, memory loss, confusion and dizziness. Participants in the cannabis cigarette group reported improvements in pain, appetite and satisfaction with treatment.
One small study (22 participants) compared cannabis oil (10 mg of cannabidiol twice daily) to placebo oil (i.e. olive oil) in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. No difference in clinical remission rates was observed. There was no difference in serious side effects. Serious side effects included worsening Crohn's disease in one participant in each group.
One small study (50 participants) compared cannabis oil (composed of 15% cannabidiol and 4% THC) to placebo oil in participants with active Crohn's disease. Positive differences in quality of life and the Crohn's disease activity index were observed. The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil on Crohn's disease are uncertain. No firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms (e.g. side effects) of cannabis and cannabis oil in adults with Crohn's disease can be drawn. The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil in people with Crohn's disease in remission have not been investigated. Further studies with larger numbers of participants are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of cannabis in Crohn's disease. Future studies should assess the effects of cannabis in people with active and inactive Crohn's disease. Different doses of cannabis and formulations (e.g. cannabis oil or pills) should be investigated.
This review includes evidence up to 23 June 2016. We included nine studies with a total of 2132 children who developed acute ear discharge beyond the immediate postoperative period. The studies evaluated a range of treatments. We primarily looked at the difference in the proportion of children whose ear discharge had resolved within two weeks after treatment was started, adverse events and serious complications. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of children whose discharge had resolved at two to four weeks and four to 12 weeks, the proportion of children whose ear pain and fever had resolved within two weeks, the duration of discharge, the proportion of children with chronic discharge, discharge recurrences, tube blockage, tube extrusion, health-related quality of life and hearing.
Antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) versus oral antibiotics
Antibiotic eardrops with or without corticosteroid were more effective than oral antibiotics in terms of resolution of ear discharge at one week (moderate-quality evidence ) and two weeks (moderate-quality evidence ), ear discharge recurrences (low-quality evidence ) and disease-specific quality of life (low-quality evidence ). We found no evidence that antibiotic eardrops were more effective in reducing the risk of chronic ear discharge (low-quality evidence ), tube blockage (low-quality evidence ), general quality of life (low-quality evidence ) or hearing (very low-quality evidence ). Adverse events occurred at similar rates (low-quality evidence ), while no serious complications occurred in either of the groups (very low-quality evidence).
Other comparisons
Antibiotic eardrops with or without corticosteroid were more effective than corticosteroid eardrops in terms of duration of ear discharge (moderate-quality evidence).
Antibiotic eardrops were more effective than saline rinsing in terms of resolution of ear discharge at one week (moderate-quality evidence ), but not in terms of tube blockage (low-quality evidence). Also, we cannot exclude an unimportant difference between antibiotic eardrops and saline rinsing in terms of resolution of discharge at one week.
Eardrops containing two antibiotics and a corticosteroid were more effective than no treatment in terms of resolution of ear discharge at two weeks (moderate-quality evidence ), duration of ear discharge (moderate-quality evidence ), reducing the risk of chronic ear discharge (low-quality evidence ) and disease-specific quality of life (low-quality evidence ). We found no evidence that antibiotic eardrops were more effective in terms of ear discharge recurrences (low-quality evidence ) or general quality of life (low-quality evidence).
Low-quality evidence suggests that antibiotic and corticosteroid combination eardrops are more effective than eardrops containing antibiotics only in terms of resolution of ear discharge within two weeks and duration of ear discharge, but not in terms of resolution of ear discharge at two to four weeks or tube blockage. There is a substantial risk of publication bias, therefore these findings should be interpreted with caution. We found moderate to low-quality evidence that antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) are more effective than oral antibiotics, corticosteroid eardrops and no treatment in children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet placement. There is some limited, inconclusive evidence that antibiotic eardrops are more effective than saline rinsing. There is uncertainty whether antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops are more effective than eardrops containing antibiotics only.
Our search identified just one randomised controlled trial which evaluated 91 participants who had tinnitus for at least six months and some degree of hearing loss. It compared those receiving hearing aids to those receiving sound generators. The average age of the patients was 38 and there were 40 women and 51 men. The study took place in two centres in Italy and the USA. The result from the single study we reviewed was not definitive and was compatible with only small differences between the effect of hearing aids and sound generators. We also found another relevant study which has not yet been completed. We believe further high-quality trials are needed. The quality of this evidence is moderate to low. This review is up to date to August 2013.
Only one small study including 13 patients with bone marrow failure was included in this review. The study was funded by two government agencies and one charity. We are aware of three ongoing studies which have not yet been completed.
The evidence is current to 26th May 2015. The one included study was too small to demonstrate any difference in all-cause mortality (death due to any cause) or number of red cell transfusions received between a restrictive compared to a liberal red blood cell transfusion policy. At the current time, there is a lack of evidence to recommend a restrictive transfusion strategy over a liberal one. Trials with good methodology are needed to determine the best transfusion policy for patients with long -term bone marrow failure disorders. The evidence for the findings was of very low quality. This was because very small numbers of participants were included in the study. Only 13 patients were recruited to the trial rather than the planned 200 participants due to problems with recruitment.
Seven studies included 105 people with bronchiectasis. Only two of these studies lasted for six months; the others were completed over a shorter time frame or involved a single treatment session. From these, it is difficult to know whether any improvement would be maintained over a longer term. The methods used to conduct these trials were not well reported; therefore, we believe that overall the evidence was of low quality. Three studies were funded by research institutions or governmental organisations; the other four studies did not report any funding. Bronchiectasis is a lung condition in which the airways become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus. People with bronchiectasis frequently report symptoms of cough, excessive mucus production and breathlessness and are at risk of chest infection. Physiotherapy treatment in the form of ACTs is often prescribed to help people clear mucus from their lungs.
We included three randomised controlled studies (involving 97 women). The quality of the studies was variable and a number of this review's important outcomes were not reported in the trials.
Two studies compared in-utero fetal tracheal occlusion with standard postnatal repair, but differences between the two studies meant that we were unable to combine the data in our analyses. Neither study reported on perinatal deaths. In single studies, in-utero fetal occlusion was associated with a slightly lower gestational age at birth but no clear difference in the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks; the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension was reduced. there was no difference between groups in terms of preterm rupture of membranes < 37 weeks or maternal infectious morbidity and there were no maternal blood transfusions. Long-term infant survival was improved with in-utero tracheal occlusion in one study, but not in the other.
In the third study, antenatal corticosteroids were compared with placebo and there was no difference in the number of perinatal deaths. Nor was there any difference in terms of the number of days that babies were given mechanical ventilation or the number of days babies spent in hospital.
We conclude that the current evidence is too limited by small numbers of pregnancies and the variable methodological quality of the trials to recommend intervention (treatment) in pregnancy for women and their unborn babies with CDH. Further high-quality trials are needed in this area. WIth regard to the administration of antenatal corticosteroids, there remains a gap in current research, and a large, high-quality trial should be undertaken to answer this unresolved question. More studies are needed to further examine the effect of in-utero fetal tracheal occlusion on important neonatal outcomes and long-term infant survival and health. Long-term follow-up is of particular importance, and should include morbidity and mortality measures. Further studies should examine the benefits of an in-utero intervention in relation to the severity of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia (i.e. moderate and severe). Indeed, there are three ongoing studies, being conducted by European, North and South American fetal medicine centres, which will contribute to this gap. Ongoing research and any implementation into clinical practice should include standardisation of the procedure, inclusion criteria and long-term childhood follow-up.
We found 25 randomised clinical trials (studies where participants with ADHD were randomly assigned to one of two or more groups) involving a total of 2690 participants. The trials lasted between five weeks and two years. The social skills training generally focused on teaching the children how to 'read' the subtle cues in social interaction, such as learning to wait for their turn, knowing when to shift topics during a conversation, and being able to recognise the emotional expressions of others. Social skills training often consists of role play, exercises and games, as well as homework. Children in the control groups either received no intervention or were placed on a waiting list. We found no significant differences between social skills training versus controls on social skills, emotional competencies, and general behaviour as assessed by teachers. Compared with the children who had no social skills training, teachers rated those who had been in the social skills groups as having fewer ADHD symptoms at the end of treatment.. However, this finding was questionable because our other analyses did not support it. We found no indications of harmful effects.
All trials suffered from methodological problems such as overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms. Many studies were also difficult to compare because they involved different interventions. The results from some trials were not very precise, which means it is difficult to be confident in the results. In seven trials, study authors were board members of pharmaceutical companies, had received funding from such companies, or had performed previous research on the topic. We are unable to conclude whether social skills training is beneficial or not for children with ADHD. We need more randomised clinical trials on social skills training for children and adolescents with ADHD that have a sufficient number of participants and higher methodological quality.The evidence base regarding adolescents is especially weak. We found no adverse treatment effects.
This review found treatment with oral steroids improved lung function and symptoms more than placebo, but not all people benefited equally. Long-term use did not slow the decline in lung function and there was an increased risk of side-effects such as diabetes and osteoporosis.
Results from 16 randomized controlled trials, predominantly of moderate to good quality, involving 994 selected participants, approximately two thirds with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who had respiratory failure and were starting to breathe spontaneously, demonstrate that support with noninvasive ventilation can decrease death, weaning failure, pneumonia and length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital. Noninvasive weaning also decreased the total duration of ventilation and the time spent on invasive ventilation, as well as the number of participants who received a tracheostomy. Although noninvasive weaning had no effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation related to weaning, it did not increase the reintubation rate. Insufficient data were available to assess its impact on quality of life. Noninvasive weaning significantly reduced mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease studies versus mixed population studies.
The objective of this review was to assess if oral and intravenous steroids are equally effective and safe in aiding in the recovery from relapses. Among the pertinent literature, only five studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 215 participants. Despite some limitations in the methods used to conduct the studies (i.e. incomplete reporting of the participants who dropped out the studies and appropriateness of the sample size) and in the analysis of the data, all five studies found that there were no significant differences in term of benefits and adverse events and in the pharmacological and radiological outcomes in patients taking oral or intravenous steroids. Both treatments appear to be equally effective and safe. Based on this evidence, oral steroid therapy may be a practical and effective alternative to intravenous steroid therapy for the treatment of MS relapses.
We searched research papers and government reports and had direct communication with individuals working in salt reduction in their respective countries. The evidence is current as of 5 January 2015, when we last searched electronic databases. Initiatives in 15 countries met the inclusion criteria. Ten of these countries provided sufficient data for quantitative analysis, gathered from studies that included 64,798 participants. Initiatives ranged from one activity (e.g. in Japan, which at the time of writing had a public information campaign) to many activities (e.g. in the United Kingdom, which provided five activities including on-package nutrition information, restrictions on marketing to children and food product reformulation). Of the 15 countries that met inclusion criteria, seven provided information about funding source, of which six reported non-industry funding. The other eight countries did not report a funding source for one or more data point(s). Five of the 10 countries included in the quantitative analysis (China, Finland, France, Ireland and England) showed a decrease in salt intake after the intervention. Two of the 10 countries (Canada, Switzerland) showed an increase in salt intake after the intervention, however, in both countries the only data available were from several years prior to the intervention starting. Because the initiatives were very different, we cannot present an overall finding of whether these types of initiatives work.
When we focused on the subset of seven countries whose salt reduction initiatives included multiple components and were not focused solely on educating the public, we found that more than half (four of seven) showed a decrease in salt intake from pre-intervention to post-intervention.
When we examined the nine initiatives that analysed men and women separately, we found that amongst men, more than half (five of nine) showed a decrease in salt intake after the intervention. Amongst women, the pattern of findings was less clear, with three of nine interventions showing a decrease, two showing an increase and four showing no change in salt intake.
Low-bias study designs, such as randomised controlled trials, typically are not suitable for evaluating complex initiatives such as these; therefore, we rated all of the studies included in this review as having low methodological quality. Large nationally representative samples of the population and careful measurement of dietary sodium intake were strengths of several studies. However, because of study design limitations, the trustworthiness of study results is not clear.
Overall, our results show that national government initiatives have the potential to achieve population-wide reductions in salt intake, especially amongst men, and particularly if they employ more than one strategy and include structural activities such as food product reformulation (i.e. food companies putting less salt in food products). The wide variation of results across the studies we found presents a challenge in interpreting the current evidence and this warrants more research to help us understand this.
We identified 34 trials with 7824 patients which randomised patients to surgery with post-surgical chemotherapy versus surgery alone. The group who received chemotherapy had a survival benefit and improvement in disease free survival (15% and 21%, respectively), although all the trials had a high risk of bias. There was no significant difference due to the stage of disease or the chemotherapy agent used.
Through literature searches updated to 20 January 2020, we found 12 studies that enrolled 5425 preterm babies and tested the effects of lactoferrin given with feeds. We also found ongoing studies that may increase the strength of our findings when their results become available. Lactoferrin given with feeds with or without a probiotic decreases blood infection including fungal infection in preterm infants with no adverse effects. Lactoferrin with probiotics, but not lactoferrin alone, decreases gastrointestinal injury. Clarification regarding dosing, duration, type of lactoferrin (human or bovine), and development of preterm babies is still needed. Low to very low
This review is up-to-date as of 24 May 2019. We included 26 studies with a total of 2435 children aged between 2 and 16 years. The studies were carried out between 2002 and 2019 in dental clinics in the UK, USA, the Netherlands, Iran, India, France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Mexico, and Korea.
We included studies comparing the use of different equipment like audiovisual glasses or a computerised device for injection called the wand, or dentist interventions like hypnosis, counter-stimulation/distraction, video modelling, to increase the acceptance of delivery of local anaesthetic. These interventions were compared against delivery of local anaesthetic using a conventional syringe (usual care), or any other dental equipment or dentist intervention. Interventions were given just before the injection and others were given just before, during the injection, and continued during the dental treatment. The evidence was uncertain for audiovisual distraction (using 3D video glasses as distraction) compared to conventional treatment. The evidence was uncertain when comparing the wand to conventional treatment. The evidence was also uncertain for counter-stimulation/distraction compared to conventional treatment and for hypnosis compared to conventional treatment.
Other comparisons considered included pre-cooling of the injection site, the wand versus another electronic system called Sleeper One, the use of a camouflage syringe, use of an electrical counter-stimulation device, and video modelling. They had a single study each. The findings from these other comparisons were not enough to be able to decide on their effectiveness.
The included studies did not mention if there were any harmful effects of the different interventions. The level of belief we have in these findings is very low. This was due to high risk of bias and the small number of people studied in the included trials. We do not have enough evidence to say which intervention works better to increase acceptance of local anaesthetic in children and adolescents. We suggest that more well-conducted studies should be done in this area.
Probiotics are bacteria and yeasts that resemble the protective bacteria of the gut and have been used in several studies to treat C. difficile infection. Unfortunately, these small studies do not provide enough evidence to support the use of probiotics for treating C. difficile infection.
This review includes 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2635 women. The trials compared carbetocin against either oxytocin or syntometrine given after delivery, vaginally or by caesarean section. The comparison between intramuscular carbetocin and oxytocin showed that there was no difference in the risk of heavy bleeding, but that women who received carbetocin were less likely to require other medications to produce uterine contractions following caesarean sections. Comparisons between carbetocin and syntometrine showed that women who received carbetocin had less blood loss compared to women who received syntometrine after vaginal delivery, and were much less likely to experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The incidence of hypertension at 30 and 60 minutes post delivery was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Five of the 11 studies were known to be supported by a pharmaceutical company.
We found 11 studies that assessed recruitment strategies used with healthcare staff in search of the literature in January 2015. Five included the total number of participants (7372). There were three main strategies:
1. Using an alert system, either a computer system or member of staff to check patient records, to alert staff recruiting participants that someone might be suitable for the study (five studies).
2. Giving additional information about the study to the staff at hospitals or clinics who are recruiting people through visits from the researchers, educational seminars or leaflets (four studies).
3. Using a designated member of staff whose primary role was to recruit participants (two studies).
All the studies identified were of quite low quality, so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from them. Five studies examined the alert system to identify participants who might be suitable for a study. Alert systems showed some promising results but were not unanimous in their findings. The four studies that evaluated the provision of additional information, visits or education to the sites recruiting participants found that none of the tested strategies led to improved recruitment. The most promising strategy appears to be the employment of someone such as a clinical trials officer or research nurse with the specific task of recruiting participants to research studies. The two studies using this strategy showed improvement in recruitment rates but both were at high risk of bias. More research is still needed to evaluate the role of a designated person to recruit to research studies.
We searched the literature in April 2014 and found 45 randomised controlled trials for this update of the review. We analysed data from 4696 participants who received treatment for their fatigue. The trials dealt with neurological diseases (such as multiple sclerosis (753 participants), post-polio syndrome (58) and Parkinson's disease (19)), different types of cancer (3223), HIV/AIDS (514), end-stage renal disease (56), multi-type advanced disease in hospice patients (30), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (28) and end-stage chronic lung disease (15).
There was weak evidence for the efficacy of amantadine, pemoline and modafinil in reducing fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis. There was also weak evidence for the efficacy of carnitine and donepezil for cancer-related fatigue. One small trial showed that people with HIV/AIDS and fatigue seemed to benefit from treatment with methylphenidate or pemoline. There was some low-quality evidence from small trials that methylphenidate, a stimulant drug that improves concentration, is effective for the management of cancer-related fatigue. There was no information about dexamphetamine, paroxetine or testosterone.
Previous studies have shown that erythropoietin and darbepoetin, drugs that improve anaemia (a shortage of red cells or haemoglobin in the blood), are also effective for cancer-related fatigue. However, due to safety concerns and side effects shown by more recent studies, erythropoietin and darbepoetin should no longer be used. Therefore, we excluded these drugs from this review update.
Overall, most side effects of the investigated drugs seemed to be mild.
Based on limited evidence from small studies, the evidence does not support the use of a specific drug for the treatment of fatigue in palliative care. Future trials should measure fatigue in advanced disease using comparable and standardised measures.
We searched for studies on 31 August 2016. Eight small randomised controlled trials are included in this updated review, with data from 707 women and babies. The studies compared different methods of inducing labour, so results could not be combined.
There were design problems in all of the trials: women and health professionals knew which induction method was being used in seven out of eight trials, which may have affected clinical decisions. Women were left out of the analysis in some trials, and trials often did not report important outcomes (vaginal birth not achieved within 24 hours of induction, overstimulation of the uterus with changes to the baby's heart rate, caesarean section, serious illness or death of the baby, serious illness or death of the mother).
The trials were too small to show clear differences. The quality of the evidence was very low, low, or moderate, because the trials were small and had high risk of bias. We cannot be certain about the results, and future research may show something different. There is not enough information available from randomised controlled trials to advise on the best methods of labour induction in women with a previous caesarean birth. More high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to find out which method is best for mothers and babies. However, such trials are unlikely to be carried out because they would need a very large number of participants in order to study the risk of infrequent but serious outcomes (such as rupture of the woman's uterus). Other types of studies (i.e. non-randomised controlled trials) might be the best alternative. Future research could focus on those methods of induction that are believed to be effective and have a low risk of serious harm. The outcomes identified as important in this review could be utilised in future studies.
There have been suggestions, based on observational studies and on laboratory markers, that dietary calcium may protect against colorectal cancer. This systematic review of the literature identified two well conducted randomised placebo-controlled intervention studies involving 1346 subjects followed for 3-4 years. The results suggest that there may be a moderate protective effect (OR 0.74; CI 0.58,0.95) for dietary supplementation of at least 1200mg elemental calcium per day on the development of colorectal adenomatous polyps. However, no trial has directly demonstrated an effect of calcium supplementation on the development of colorectal cancer itself.
We included two trials in this review with 50 participants aged between 17 and 58 years and diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and postural abnormalities. The trials compared manual therapy (all physical therapies that promote relaxation of the muscles, as well as mobilization of the spine, such as massage, spinal mobilization) with usual care (the normal treatment they used to receive). Participants were placed in each treatment group at random. One trial was in hospital inpatients and lasted 20 days and the second was in outpatients and lasted three months. Most of the outcomes were reported in both trials. The trials did not find any difference between manual therapy and usual care for changes in trunk deformity. We could not combine results for quality of life or pain scores because they were too different. We were not able to find a difference between manual therapy and usual care for lung function. Only one trial (15 participants) measured the change in walked distance which seemed to favour manual therapy over usual care, but this was not clear because there were a large range of results. One trial reported that participants from the manual therapy group enjoyed the type of the treatment they received and that adherence was also high. None of the trials reported any side effects. Overall, there was only low- to very low-quality of evidence in all outcomes considered. Low-quality evidence means that our confidence in the effect of manual therapy is limited and the true effect may be very different. We think the fact that people knew which treatment they were receiving can affect the results for the change in quality of life, change in pain and change in lung function outcomes, but this may not affect the other outcomes. Therefore, we are still not confident that manual therapies improve outcomes that we consider important for the treatment of postural abnormalities.
We performed a thorough literature search for studies reporting the accuracy of drain fluid amylase in identifying pancreatic leaks. We included studies reported up to 20 February 2017. We identified five studies reporting information on 868 people who underwent pancreatic resections for cancer and non-cancerous growths. Most studies included only people in whom the head of the pancreas (right side of the pancreas) was removed. Variations in when the studies measured the amylase content in the drain and what level was considered abnormal meant that we were not able to combine the data to provide the overall results. We are uncertain whether drain fluid amylase is useful in identifying pancreatic leaks because of the following reasons.
1. The way that study authors confirmed that a participant had or did not have pancreatic leak was itself subject to error (i.e. there was no true 'gold standard').
2. The studies included few participants. As a result, there was significant uncertainty in the results.
3. The studies were of poor methodological quality. This introduced additional uncertainty in the results. All of the studies were of unclear or low methodological quality, which may result in arriving at false conclusions.
We included studies of adults who received planned surgery with general anaesthesia. We looked at seven psychological preparation techniques: procedural information (information about what, when and how processes will happen); sensory information (what the experience will feel like and what other sensations they may have, e.g. taste, smell); behavioural instruction (telling patients what they need to do); cognitive intervention (techniques that aim to change how people think); relaxation techniques; hypnosis; and emotion-focused interventions (techniques that aim to help people to manage their feelings). The psychological preparation had to be delivered before surgery for the study to be included in the review. We included studies that looked at the effect of psychological preparation on pain, behavioural recovery, length of stay and negative emotion after surgery (within one month). Studies were included in the review up to the search date of 4 May 2014. We updated the search on 7 July 2015 and will incorporate the 38 studies found in this later search when the review is updated. We included 105 studies from 115 papers, with 10,302 participants taking part. Sixty-one studies measured the outcome pain, 14 behavioural recovery, 58 length of stay and 49 negative emotion. In accordance with the review protocol, we did not record details about funding sources. In this review we included 105 studies, which were reported in 115 papers. A total of 10,302 participants were randomized in these studies. For pain, length of stay and negative emotion we combined numerical findings from the studies. We found that psychological preparation before surgery seemed to reduce pain and negative emotion after the operation and may reduce the time spent in hospital by around half a day but the quality of the evidence was low. Also, the studies used many different psychological preparation techniques (often in different combinations) so it was not possible to discover which techniques were better. We could not statistically combine numerical findings for behavioural recovery because few studies provided sufficient details and studies used different ways of measuring how quickly people returned to usual activities. In reviewing the studies, we found that psychological preparation, in particular behavioural instruction, may have the potential to improve behavioural recovery. However, the quality of this evidence was very low. We looked at the effect of psychological preparation on pain, behavioural recovery, length of stay and negative emotion in this review and did not find evidence to suggest that psychological preparation might lead to harm in these outcomes. However, as we did not look at other outcomes it is possible that we did not identify potential harm. Many studies were poorly reported, so we could not be confident that findings were reliable. For this reason and because of the large variation in psychological techniques, types of surgery and measures used, we graded the quality of the evidence as `low' for the outcomes pain, negative emotion and length of stay; we cannot be confident that these techniques help patients to recover from surgery. For behavioural recovery, we further downgraded the quality of the evidence to `very low' because of problems with measurement and reporting of the outcome.
We found 47 studies with 4377 adults and children. Most studies took place in hospitals, universities or specialist practices, NHS clinics, or a mixture of places. Most of the studies tested: removable retainers versus fixed retainers; different types of fixed retainers or bonding materials; or different types of removable retainers. Most measured the effects of treatment for less than one year.  Teeth may return to their previous position more with part-time wear of a removable retainer made of clear plastic than with a fixed retainer, but the difference was so small that it may not be important. If the removable retainer is worn full-time, there may be no difference between the retainers in tooth movement. Clear plastic retainers worn part-time may fail less than fixed retainers, but when worn full-time may fail more. Better gum health may be achieved with clear plastic removable retainers than with fixed retainers, but no difference was found in tooth decay. CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) nitinol fixed retainers compared to conventional multistrand wire fixed retainers may not differ in terms of how well they hold the teeth straight, gum health, or how long they last.
Fibre-reinforced composite retainers are less obvious on the teeth therefore participants are more satisfied with them because of their appearance. Fibre-reinforced composite retainers may be slightly better at keeping the teeth straight, but the difference was so small, it might not be important. Fibre-reinforced composite retainers might be more likely to fail earlier and be associated with more gum problems than multistrand fixed retainers. The effects of Hawley removable retainers compared with clear plastic retainers on movement of the teeth may be similar, whether they are worn full- or part-time. Clear plastic retainers may provide better patient satisfaction but be less likely to last than Hawley retainers. Our confidence in the evidence is low because the studies were small and did not use the best methods. Very few studies looked at more than one of the things we were interested in. Most studies measured results less than a year following treatment. Also, we do not know how much study results may be affected by the age of the participants and whether they are still growing, what kind of problems they had with their teeth before their first braces, and what other treatment they had, such as extractions. The evidence is up to date to 27 April 2022. This review updates one originally published in 2004 and last updated in 2016.
This Cochrane Review included 30 randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) assessing pretreatment with COCP, progestogen or oestrogen in 5096 women undergoing ART. The evidence is current to January 2017. Among women undergoing ovarian stimulation in antagonist protocols, COCP pretreatment was associated with a lower rate of live birth or ongoing pregnancy than no pretreatment. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy were influenced by pretreatment with progestogens or oestrogens, or by COCP pretreatment using other stimulation protocols. Findings on adverse events were inconclusive, except that progesterone pretreatment may reduce the risk of ovarian cysts in agonist cycles, and COCP in antagonist cycles may reduce the risk of pregnancy loss compared with no pretreatment in agonist cycles. .
Overall evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate. The main problems were risk of bias and imprecision. Most studies did not describe their methods in adequate detail.
We wanted to find out about the benefits and risks of using a specific NSAID, ketorolac, for relief of short-term pain after surgery. Ketorolac can be given as an injection, which may be useful when patients cannot take medicines by mouth. We searched for studies that involved adults (aged over 18) and compared a single injection of ketorolac against:
· a placebo (dummy treatment); or
· another treatment.
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 12 studies that involved 1905 people in total. The studies investigated the treatment of pain after surgery on the abdomen, pelvis, teeth, bones, joints and muscles. Most studies (10) treated people with a dose of 30 milligrams of ketorolac. They compared ketorolac against:
· a placebo;
· another NSAID; or
· an opioid.
Here we present the findings from comparisons between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDs.
Pain reduction
The evidence suggests that:
· around three times more people may have their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within six hours of surgery when treated with ketorolac rather than placebo; and
· there could be little to no difference between ketorolac and other NSAIDS in the number of people with pain reduced by 50% or more within four or six hours of surgery.
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication)
Ketorolac could delay the need for rescue medication compared to placebo or other NSAIDs. The evidence is not robust enough to show if fewer people need rescue medicine when treated with ketorolac.
Adverse effects
Ketorolac probably causes slightly more adverse effects than placebo and other NSAIDS. Serious adverse effects (such as blood collecting in the muscles around the abdomen, causing severe pain) were rare in the studies we found; the evidence suggested there may be little to no difference in the number of serious adverse events between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDS. Studies were small, and most may have been conducted in ways that could introduce errors into their results. This limited our confidence in the evidence. The evidence is up to date to April 2020.
This review included 29 randomised controlled trials involving 10,390 participants (current to September 2016), which compared LMWH or UFH for treating people with blood clots. Pooling the results of these trials showed that fewer participants treated with LMWH formed further blood clots and that fewer cases of bleeding occurred. Use of LMWH also reduced the size of the original blood clot when compared to the UFH group. There was no difference in number of deaths between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with UFH.
Quality of the evidence
Results of this review indicate that LMWH may prevent further blood clots and bleeding in people with VTE. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution due to the moderate quality of the evidence as a result of lack of reporting of study methods and problems with study design. Results indicating reduced size of blood clots when taking LMWH also must be interpreted with caution due to the low quality of evidence as results were not similar across the studies.
We searched for studies from the year in which the first paper about using ultrasound to diagnose trauma patients was published until 15 July 2017. We considered 2296 records and included 34 relevant studies that involved 8635 participants in this review. All 34 studies were published between 1992 and 2017, with the number of participants in each study ranging from 51 to 3181. Ten studies included only children, two studies only adults, and the remaining 22 studies included both children and adults. In many studies, important information about the selection of participants and choice of the diagnostic tests against which to compare POCS was not reported. We therefore rated the methodological quality of the available evidence mostly as unclear. Point-of-care sonography had a sensitivity (i.e. the ability to detect a person with the disease) of 74% and a specificity (i.e. the ability to exclude a person without the disease) of 96%. Sensitivity and specificity varied considerably across studies, which was due in part to variation in study, participant, and injury characteristics. In children, both the sensitivity and specificity of POCS were lower than in an adult or mixed population, meaning that POCS was less able to identify or rule out an injury. Based on our results, we would expect that amongst 1000 patients of a mixed-age population with suspected blunt trauma to the abdomen or chest, POCS would miss 73 patients with injuries, and would falsely suggest the presence of injuries in 29 patients who were unaffected. This result emphasises the need for additional imaging in trauma patients for whom POCS shows no injuries (i.e. a negative result), to check whether they are really injury-free.
This review is based on 27 studies including 1251 participants. Participants were children and adolescents aged under 16 years who had prominent upper front teeth (Class II Division 1 malocclusion). The evidence in this review is up to date as of 27 September 2017. The evidence suggests that providing orthodontic early treatment to children with prominent upper front teeth reduces the incidence of damage to upper incisor teeth significantly (middle four teeth at the top) as compared to treatment that is provided in one phase in adolescence. There are no other advantages of providing a two-phase treatment (i.e. between age seven to 11 years and again in adolescence) compared to treatment in one phase in adolescence.
The evidence also suggests that providing treatment with functional appliances for adolescents with prominent upper front teeth, significantly reduces their prominence when compared to adolescents who did not receive any treatment. The studies did not suggest that any particular appliance was better than any other for reducing teeth prominence. The overall quality of the evidence is low for most comparisons and outcomes, therefore further research is needed and may change the findings.
We found 71 relevant studies, but not all measured the outcomes we were interested in. Forty-two studies were included in the quality of life analyses (measured on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), and 46 were included in the lung function analyses.
Evidence from good quality and similar trials supported LABA/ICS combinations as the most likely treatment strategy to bring the greatest improvement to quality of life and lung function. Combination therapy gave an average benefit of 3.9 units over placebo at six months. LAMAs and LABAs were ranked second and third at six months (-2.63 and -2.29 units, respectively), especially when unreliable trials were not included, but a large degree of overlap in the estimates was noted.
Combination LABA/ICS was the highest ranked class for trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), with mean improvement over placebo of 133 mL at six months (95% credible Interval (CrI) 101 to 164). As was the case for SGRQ, LAMAs (mean difference (MD) 104, 95% CrI 82 to 125) were ranked just ahead of LABAs (MD 99, 95% CrI 72 to 128) at six months, and ICSs were the lowest ranked class (MD 65, 95% CrI 33 to 97).
For both outcomes, the effects of LABA and ICS used alone appeared to increase when used together for six months, but initial differences between the treatment classes were less obvious after a year of treatment. Quality of life and lung function were improved most on combination inhalers (LABA and ICS) and least on ICS alone at 6 and 12 months. Overall LAMA and LABA inhalers had similar effects, particularly at 12 months. The network has demonstrated the benefit of ICS when added to LABA for these outcomes in participants who largely had an FEV1that was less than 50% predicted, but the additional expense of combination inhalers and any potential for increased adverse events (which has been shown by other reviews) require consideration. Our findings are in keeping with current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.
In this review article we have included 18 trials on the efficacy and safety of sugammadex. The trials included a total of 1321 patients. Sugammadex was shown to be more effective than placebo (no medication) or neostigmine in reversing muscle relaxation caused by neuromuscular blockade during surgery and is relatively safe. Serious complications occurred in less than 1% of the patients who received sugammadex. The results of this review article (specially the safety results) need to be confirmed by future trials on larger patient populations.
This review compared day hospital care (in day treatment centres and transitional day hospitals) to outpatient care. Overall there was insufficient evidence to determine whether any of the three types of day hospital care had substantial advantages over outpatient care.
We performed a thorough literature search for studies reporting the accuracy of different scans until 19 July 2016. We identified 54 studies reporting information on 3196 people with focal pancreatic lesions. These studies evaluated one or more of the above tests and compared these test results with the eventual diagnosis provided by surgical removal of the lesion and examination under microscope. There were no diagnostic test accuracy studies of EUS elastography or studies that looked at multiple scans rather than single scans. Variations in how studies defined precancerous and cancerous lesions meant that we were not able to combine the data to provide the overall results for many tests. We were unable to arrive at any firm conclusions for the following reasons.
• The way that study authors classified focal pancreatic lesions into cancerous, precancerous, and benign lesions was not consistent in different studies.
• The studies included few participants, leading to significant uncertainty in the results.
• The studies were of poor methodological quality, which introduced additional uncertainty in the results.
• Even among the studies that classified focal pancreatic lesions into cancerous, precancerous, and benign lesions in a similar manner, the results were not consistent. All of the studies were of low methodological quality, which may result in arriving at false conclusions.
Routine digital vaginal examination (examination of the cervix with a finger) during pregnancy, used to reduce the prevalence of preterm birth, is not supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials. Preterm labour is often preceded by changes in the cervix although the woman does not experience any symptoms. Effective detection and appropriate management of risk of preterm birth is key to improved care. Repeat digital cervical assessment is a simple inexpensive technique that uses a disposable glove and takes only one or two minutes to complete. It has been promoted as a routine intervention during pregnancy as a screening test for the risk of preterm birth (that is, birth occurring before 37 weeks of gestation), which can then be managed. It is in standard use in many parts of Europe, Africa and to a lesser extent in the US.
The review included two randomized controlled trials that enrolled a total of 7163 pregnant women. The number of women experiencing preterm birth was similar with and without routine digital vaginal examination when it was not medically indicated. One was a multicentre performed in countries where the intervention was routine and in countries where it was not. Causes for concern included the potential risk of infection and preterm labour from the vaginal examination as well as discomfort and embarrassment for the woman. We have found insufficient evidence to assess adverse effects of the intervention.
We wanted to find out whether endovascular therapy in addition to conventional medical treatment was more effective than conventional medical treatment alone for preventing stroke and death in people with symptomatic ICAS. We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that assign participants to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) that compared the two treatments in people with symptomatic ICAS. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included four trials with a total of 989 participants who had recent symptoms of ICAS. Three trials were carried out across multiple centres and compared endovascular therapy involving stents with conventional medical treatment. Two trials took place in Chinese centres and compared different types of endovascular therapy with conventional medical treatment in Chinese participants. People who received endovascular therapy as well as conventional medical treatment were more likely to die or have a stroke in the short term and in the long term. There were no major differences in the rates of ischaemic stroke and death or dependency in the long term. We are moderately confident in some results and have little confidence in others, because the studies enroled few people. The evidence is up to date to 16 August 2022.
This review looked for evidence of MD rehabilitation in adults with multiple sclerosis. The authors concluded there was strong evidence that inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation can lead to improvement in activity (disability) and in overall ability to participate in society, even though there is no reduction in actual impairment. There was limited evidence for short-term improvements in symptoms and disability, and in participation and quality of life with the high intensity outpatient and home-based rehabilitation programmes. For low intensity programmes conducted over a longer period there were longer term gains in quality of life; and for benefits to carers in terms of general health and engagement in social activities. The evidence available for other aspects of MD rehabilitation, including outpatient and home based therapy is not yet sufficient to allow many conclusions to be drawn.
Twenty three studies randomised 976 participants with type 1 diabetes to either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or multiple injections. Seven of the 23 studies were performed in participants under 18 years of age and the remainder were performed in adults. Study duration ranged from six days to four years. The body of evidence suggests that continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion may be better than multiple injections for glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes; continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion appears to provide no benefit for reducing non-severe hypoglycaemic events. Future studies need to consider the short and long term adverse effects, mortality, morbidity and costs of these interventions.
We searched medical databases such as Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, conference proceedings and study registries (January 2000 to August 2017). No trial evaluated one TPO mimetic (romiplostim or eltrombopag) versus another. We found eight eligible trials (six included, two ongoing, one of which is completed but without final results for MDS patients) and we included 746 adult patients in our review. The trials were randomised, double-blinded and used either romiplostim or eltrombopag versus placebo. In four trials hypomethylating agents or immunomodulatory drugs were administered in combination to romiplostim or eltrombopag. Only adults were included. A meta-analysis of overall survival data was not possible, since data were too heterogeneous to pool. Instead of that, we analysed mortality data. There was no evidence for a difference between TPO mimetics and placebo in terms of mortality during study, transformation to AML, transfusion requirement, adverse events and serious adverse events. Thrombopoietin mimetics probably decrease the number of patients having bleeding events. In the study population, 713 out of 1000 in the placebo arm had a bleeding event, compared to 656 of 1000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 613 to 699) in the TPO mimetics arm. No trial evaluated health-related quality. The quality of evidence for the outcomes incidence of bleeding events and all adverse events is moderate due to high risk of bias (small sample sizes and imbalances in baseline characteristics in three trials, premature closure of two trials, selective reporting in one trial, industrial sponsorship). The quality of evidence for the outcomes mortality during study and transfusion requirements is low, due to imprecision through small number of events and high risk of bias. It is very low for the outcomes transformation to AML and serious adverse events, because of very small number of events, high risk of bias and heterogeneity between trials. Although this systematic review reveals a potential patient-relevant benefit regarding decreasing bleeding events for evaluated adult patients, future trials should focus on outcomes referring to safety, efficacy and quality of life aspects of TPO mimetics to test their everyday usage. The assumption of premature progress to AML could not be clearly verified. Because of the low number of included trials and small sample sizes, uncertainties of the findings in this review exist and demand further investigation with more trials and participants and longer follow-up periods.
We conducted a literature search on 29 May 2018 for studies that compared DBS with sham stimulation (same surgical procedure, but no electrical impulses are delivered through the electrodes placed in the brain), best medical therapy, and placebo (a pretend medicine). We found two studies that compared DBS with sham stimulation, and included a total of 102 participants. One study included participants with dystonia of the limbs and trunk, and the other with dystonia of the neck. Participants received active DBS for a total of six months. The average age of people in the studies was 50 years; the average duration of the disease was 16 years. Both studies were funded by a DBS device manufacturer with possible interests in the results of the studies. For limb and trunk dystonia, DBS may improve symptoms, self-assessed clinical status, and functioning. The results showed that for neck dystonia, DBS may improve symptoms, clinical status, functioning, and mood. For either type of dystonia, we are uncertain about the impact that DBS has on harmful or undesired events, or treatment tolerability. The overall quality of the evidence for neck, limb, and trunk dystonia was low to very low. Further research is needed to draw conclusions about the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of DBS in people with dystonia, especially beyond the three- to six-month duration of the included studies.
We searched the scientific literature in May 2019. We found two studies (one more than when we last searched in 2014). The studies compared what happens in children (aged up to 18 years old) treated using central lines who received LMWH and those who did not. A total of 1135 children were followed for between 30 and 64 days. During that time, the number of blood clots, bleeding episodes and deaths were recorded. One study also looked at the number of deaths five years after treatment.
The two studies we found did not allow us to determine with certainty whether or not LMWH protects children with central lines from getting blood clots (with or without symptoms).
The studies also did not allow us to determine whether children on LMWH were more likely to experience bleeding (minor or severe), or whether LMWH increases or reduces the risk of death.
The two studies did not report any additional adverse effects caused by LMWH. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low for blood clots, low for major bleeding, very low for minor bleeding, and low for mortality. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low because:
⦁ there were differences in the way blood clots, bleeding and mortality were measured between studies;
⦁ there were few studies and events; and
⦁ the researchers and children in the studies knew who was receiving LMWH and who was not, which can influence results.
It is likely that future studies will have an important impact on our understanding of the role of LMWH to prevent blood clots and its side effects. We need more studies on whether LMWH prevents blood clots in children who are treated using central venous lines.
Research has shown that physicians in the community (in doctors' offices and clinics) can be partly to blame for resistant bacteria. Studies have shown that physicians inappropriately prescribe antibiotics for infections caused by viruses (such as the common cold). They also prescribe antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria when an antibiotic that kills specific bacteria should be prescribed. Physicians may also prescribe the wrong dose for the wrong length of time. Inappropriate prescribing is due to many factors including patients who insist on antibiotics, physicians who do not have enough time to explain why antibiotics are not necessary and therefore simply prescribe them to save time, physicians who do not know when to prescribe antibiotics or how to recognise a serious bacterial infection, or physicians who are overly cautious.
To improve how physicians prescribe antibiotics in the community, methods have been studied. In this review, 39 studies were analysed to determine what works. Using printed materials to educate physicians about prescribing or to give them feedback about how they prescribed did not improve their prescribing or only improved it by a small amount. Meetings to educate physicians improved their prescribing but lectures did not. It was not clear whether personal visits to the physicians by educators worked or not or whether reminders to physicians worked or not . The use of delayed prescriptions decreased use of antibiotics without increasing the risk of serious illness. A delayed prescription means the physician gives a patient a prescription for an antibiotic a few days after the doctor visit; it is thought that if the infection is not serious it will clear up on its own over that time and the patient does not need the antibiotics. The studies also found that using many methods together, such as the ones above, worked better than using one method alone.
Since there are many reasons why physicians in the community prescribe antibiotics inappropriately, one method cannot be recommended. But using many methods to change prescribing may be successful.
It was compared with standard treatment in five trials for infants with very severe lung disease and resulted in a reduction in mortality. This effect was observed principally in infants with birth weights over two kilograms. Mechanical ventilation has become standard therapy for severe respiratory failure. There have been no trials in modern neonatal intensive care units so the magnitude of the benefits and harms in current practice are not known.
Our search found 13 relevant studies. No studies reported whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes. Eleven trials, all funded by tobacco companies and with 2666 adult smokers, compared unwanted effects and toxin levels in people randomly assigned to use heated tobacco or to continue smoking cigarettes or abstain from tobacco use.
Two studies looked at how trends in cigarette sales changed following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan. We do not know whether using heated tobacco helps people to stop smoking cigarettes (no studies measured this).
We are uncertain whether the chances of getting unwanted symptoms from being asked to use heated tobacco are different compared with cigarettes (6 studies, 1713 participants) or no tobacco (2 studies, 237 participants). Serious unwanted symptoms in the short time period studied (average 13 weeks) were rare in all groups, which means we are uncertain about any differences. Toxin levels were probably lower in people using heated tobacco than those smoking cigarettes (10 studies, 1959 participants), but may be higher than in people not using any tobacco products (5 studies, 382 participants).
The launch of heated tobacco products in Japan may have caused the decline in cigarette sales to speed up over time (two studies), but it is unclear whether the fall in the percentage of people who smoke also sped up because no studies looked at this. Results are based on data from a small number of studies, most of which were funded by tobacco companies.
Results on unwanted effects are likely to change as more evidence becomes available. However, we are moderately confident that levels of measured toxins are lower in people using heated tobacco than smoking cigarettes, but less confident that levels were higher than in people not using any tobacco. We are also less confident that the launch of heated tobacco caused the fall in cigarette sales to speed up, as results came from a single country.
We aimed to find out which measures allowed schools to safely reopen or stay open during the COVID-19 pandemic. We wanted to know which measures were best at preventing the spread of disease (transmission), measured by number of new cases, deaths and hospitalization. We also looked at unintended consequences, such as the effect on children's lives outside school and their education. We searched for studies that looked at the impact of these measures in schools among students (aged 4 to 18 years) or individuals relating to the school (staff or parents, for example), or both, on the number of people with COVID-19, the healthcare system (hospital beds, for example) and social aspects (such as the effect on children's education). We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 33 studies. Fifteen studies provided evidence on our most important points and the rest did not provide such useful evidence. Studies took place in primary and secondary schools, mostly in North America but also in Europe. Four studies from the USA investigated the impact of school measures to reduce contact. Remote teaching (e.g. over a computer link) compared to in-person teaching probably reduced the spread of COVID-19 and hospitalizations, but probably had no effect on deaths in the general population. The effects of hybrid teaching (a combination of in-person and remote teaching), compared to remote teaching were mixed.
We found that other measures had mixed effects. Closing playgrounds and cafeterias may have increased risk of infection. Keeping the same teacher may have had no effect, and cancelling out-of-school activities, keeping the same students together, and restricting entry for parents and caregivers may have reduced the risk of infection. However, this evidence is very uncertain. Seven studies from the USA showed that mask wearing may have reduced the spread of COVID-19 and that a stricter mask policy probably had a larger effect. There was mixed evidence of an effect of physical distancing on risk of infection, with results showing that there was probably a decrease in risk for students, but an increase for staff. There was some evidence that improved ventilation in school buildings probably reduced transmission. One study found that not sharing supplies and increasing desk space in schools may have reduced risk of infection, but that desk shields may have increased it, but we are very uncertain about this evidence. Six studies from the USA, UK, Germany and Israel investigated surveillance and response measures. One study found that daily testing to replace or reduce quarantine probably helped to reduce transmission. Studies that evaluated surveillance measures found mixed results for transmission with rapid antigen test home testing, but the evidence was very uncertain. Studies looking at polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory tests also showed that there was probably no spread of COVID-19 at school and at home after students or staff were in the same room as someone who had tested positive. Two studies found that replacing or making quarantine shorter using daily testing may have been related to missing less school. One study from the USA showed fewer infections when a higher number of measures were in place, but the evidence was very uncertain. The evidence for this updated review is stronger than the findings of the original review in most areas. The depth, breadth and quality of the research needs to be strengthened, with better study designs and adjustment for risk factors. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.
This updated Cochrane Review found nine randomised controlled trials involving 3948 women (search date 30 November 2016). Five studies (including 3057 women) looked at manual fundal pressure versus no fundal pressure and four studies (including 891 women) looked at fundal pressure applied using an inflatable belt.
We found no evidence that manual fundal pressure made a difference to numbers of women giving birth vaginally within a given time (very low-quality evidence), or having an instrumental birth, caesarean section, or vaginal birth (very low-quality evidence). The time women took to give birth when pushing was not affected by manual fundal pressure (very low-quality evidence). The numbers of babies who did not cope well with labour and had low arterial cord pH, or low Apgar scores were the same whether their mother had fundal pressure or not (all very low-quality evidence). No babies died in either group. Studies did not report on possible severe problems or death of the women.
For women giving birth for the first time, fundal pressure by inflatable belt could possibly mean that fewer women had an instrumental or caesarean birth (very low-quality evidence), but the evidence was not clear. In these women, the inflatable belt meant they pushed for less time than women pushing without the belt (very low-quality evidence). The inflatable belt did not make any difference to numbers of women having caesarean sections, babies with low arterial cord pH (low-quality evidence), or Apgar scores five minutes after birth (very low-quality evidence). No studies reported if the women gave birth within a given time, numbers of babies that died or possible serious problems or death of the women. No studies used inflatable belts in women who had given birth before. There is not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to show whether manual fundal pressure or fundal pressure by inflatable belt are effective ways of shortening the pushing stage of labour and avoiding operative births, and whether the techniques are safe. So currently there is insufficient evidence to support the use of fundal pressure by any method in the second stage of labour.
Future studies should be of good quality, clearly describe how fundal pressure was applied, and focus on safety of the unborn baby, perineal outcomes, longer-term maternal outcomes and the mothers’ satisfaction.
This review assessed evidence from nine randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, in which there were 906 adults in comparisons of diflunisal (a non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug) with placebo for treatment of moderate to severe acute post-operative pain. It is an effective analgesic over the dose range 250 mg to 1000 mg, with a long duration of action. At 1000 mg, the analgesic effect over 4 to 6 hours is as good as the combination of paracetamol 1000 mg and codeine 60 mg in similar studies using the same methods.
The hormones oestrogen and progesterone have established physiological roles in maintaining pregnancy. It has been suggested that supplementation of these hormones could help prevent miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy, particularly in women who have low levels of the hormones, in assisted reproductive technology programs, or who have a history of repeated miscarriages. In our review of randomised controlled trials published in major scientific databases, we only identified two trials that met our inclusion criteria. The two trials involved small numbers of women. One involved 161 women with diabetes who took oral placebo or oral diethylstilboestrol and ethisterone in increasing doses from before the end of the 16th week until birth. The other trial involved 120 women with pregnancy assisted by in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer who continued treatment until the completed 12th week of gestation.
From the little evidence available, the two trials found no evidence that combined oestrogen and progestogen can prevent miscarriage (progestogen is a major class of hormones which includes progesterone) when compared with placebo or usual care. The first of the two studies indicated an increased risk for the mothers who used hormonal therapy during pregnancy of developing cancer later in life. Diethylstilboestrol is no longer in use and poses serious adverse effects while ethisterone contains androgenic properties thought to be responsible for genital abnormalities and has been replaced by progesterone.
Overall, we acknowledge the lack of trials, especially large-scale trials, and therefore suggest further research is needed in this area before supporting or disproving the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone for the prevention of miscarriages.
The evidence is current to 5 October 2015. A total of 1098 participants were enrolled from Brazil, China, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, the UK and the US. All enrolled participants were similar with respect to age and most were men. The participants had varying severity of the disease; some displayed symptoms for less than 20 days up to six months. Most studies did not report their source of funding, four studies were industry funded, and six studies were non-industry funded. The studies considered a wide range of treatments. As a result, there were not enough studies of any one treatment to provide good evidence of treatment effects. In general, no significant side effects were noted. The overall quality of the presently available published evidence was either low or very low. This finding indicates that future published research is very likely to have an important impact on the conclusions currently provided in this review.
We searched a wide variety of scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (studies that allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups in a random manner) in adults (over 18 years of age) who had a heart attack, had angina (chest pain), underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (a surgical procedure that diverts blood around narrowed or clogged sections of the major arteries to improve blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart muscle) or percutaneous coronary intervention (a procedure that opens up blocked coronary arteries), or with heart failure who were eligible for cardiac rehabilitation.
Reviewers found 26 trials (5299 participants) that were suitable for inclusion (16 trials of interventions to improve enrolment, eight trials of interventions to improve adherence, and seven trials of interventions to improve programme completion). These studies evaluated a variety of techniques to improve utilisation such as providing peer support, starting cardiac rehabilitation early after hospitalisation, providing patient education, offering cardiac rehabilitation outside a hospital setting, and offering shorter programmes or women-only programmes. Strategies to increase enrolment were effective, particularly those that targeted healthcare providers, training nurses, or allied healthcare providers to intervene face-to-face. Interventions to increase adherence to programmes and to increase completion were effective, but it remains unclear which specific strategies were implemented.
We found no studies providing information about potential harms and two studies reporting costs of these strategies to increase use of cardiac rehabilitation. Some studies provided interventions to increase rehabilitation utilisation in women and older patients. Evidence was insufficient for quantitative assessment of whether women-tailored programmes were associated with increased utilisation, but motivating women appears key. For older participants, qualitative analysis suggested that peer support or postdischarge visits may improve enrolment, and group sessions promoting self-regulation skills may increase completion. Most of the included studies were of good quality (i.e. low risk of arriving at wrong conclusions because of favouritism by researchers). The quality of the evidence was low for enrolment and adherence and was moderate for completion. Publication bias for enrolment was not evident.
Can psychological interventions help people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, and are there any harmful or unwanted effects of these interventions (e.g. anxiety or depression)?
Which techniques (e.g. goal-setting, problem-solving) work best at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments? We searched for studies comparing different types of psychological interventions, or comparing the interventions with usual care, for helping people with CF of any age to take their inhaled treatments.
We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the trial methods. We included 10 trials with 1642 people with CF (approximately 54.3% female). Four trials included children and adolescents; five trials included adults; and one trial included both. Nine trials compared a psychological intervention with usual care, and one study compared two psychological interventions (MI versus EPS). People (or in one trial, CF centres) were randomly selected for one group or the other. People were followed up for between six to eight weeks and 23 months.
Psychological interventions were wide-ranging. They included an intervention that combined digital technology (website or app) with support from trained healthcare professionals. Interventions used a range of techniques, with problem-solving and providing instructions on how to take treatments being the most commonly used. Psychological interventions are probably better than usual care at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, and may cause little or no harm (e.g. anxiety or depression) when measured six to 12 months after treatment. Psychological interventions may also improve perceived treatment burden (as measured using a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in terms of lung function (a measure of how well someone's lungs are working), the number of chest infections, or perceived chest symptoms (again measured using a QoL questionnaire).
We are uncertain whether MI was better or worse than EPS at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, improving lung function or QoL, or reducing chest infections in people with CF. The included trial did not look at whether MI or EPS caused harm (e.g. anxiety or depression). Our confidence in the evidence for psychological interventions being better or worse than usual care ranges from low to moderate. The biggest included trial of psychological interventions (which had results from between six and 12 months after treatment started) focused on adults with CF (aged 16 years and over), whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader (i.e. we cannot be sure if the results would be the same in children). Large trials with a longer follow-up period (e.g. 12 months) are needed in children with CF. It is possible that because people completing the outcome assessments knew which group they were in, this might affect the results for QoL, anxiety and depression.
We are not confident in the evidence comparing MI with EPS. The only trial examining this included a small number of adults, so we cannot be sure if the results would be the same in children or in a larger group of people. We are unsure whether participants were put into the different treatment groups truly at random, so differences between the groups might be due to differences between people rather than the treatments. We are also unsure about people leaving the trial early and how this might affect the results. We also think that because the people completing the outcome assessments knew which group they were in, this might affect the QoL results.
Current evidence on which techniques (e.g. goal-setting, problem-solving) work best at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments is limited. Future trials should provide more details on the techniques used in interventions. The evidence is up to date to 7 August 2022.
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in slowing the progression of myopia in children and adolescents. We included two studies conducted in Taiwan with a total of 131 school children and did not combine the results as the two trials assessed different outcomes. One study found no significant difference in changes in the length of the eyes. Both studies found several children experienced mild pain while pressing and dropped out. The included studies in this review were unable to provide evidence of the effect of acupuncture for slowing the progression of myopia. More trials should be conducted where acupuncture is compared to placebo, other types of acupuncture are investigated, compliance with treatment for at least six months is explored and axial length elongation of the eye should be for at least one year.
In this review, we analysed data from 10 non-randomised (cohort; a study in which a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time, to examine associations between different treatments received and subsequent outcomes) studies. All the studies compared RRSO with or without risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM; surgical removal of breasts) versus no RRSO (surveillance). The evidence is current to July 2017. Including data from both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, this analysis found that RRSO may improve overall survival, and reduce deaths from HGSC and breast cancer. When analysed by mutated gene, there was evidence for a reduction in risk of HGSC and breast cancer for women with BRCA1 mutations, but may or may not have been an effect on women with BRCA2 mutations due to low numbers of women with these mutations in the studies. None of the studies reported on bone fracture or severe side effects. Both RRSO and RRM may have improved overall survival, but did not reduce deaths from breast cancer. There was no protection and differences for breast cancer mortality according to age at RRSO (50 years of age or less versus more than 50 years) in BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers. RRSO may have improved quality of life with regard to ovarian cancer risk perception. The reliability of the evidence was low to very low due to the small numbers of participants and low methodological quality of included studies. RRSO in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations may improve overall survival and may reduce the number of HGSC and breast cancer deaths when women with mutations in both genes were combined. RRSO may reduce the risk of death from HGSC and breast cancer in women with BRCA1 mutations, but may or may not reduce the risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers. These results should be interpreted with caution due to low quality of study designs and risk of bias profiles. We cannot make any conclusions regarding number of bone fracture, overall quality of life, severe side effects for RRSO and effects of RRSO based on type of risk-reducing surgery and age at the time of RRSO. However, we found the reliability of the evidence to be very low, so there is still a need for large, high-quality studies which should specifically look at these outcomes for differences in BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers.
We wanted to analyse the effects of storing human insulin above or below the manufacturers' recommended insulin temperature or advised usage time, or both. We searched medical databases and contacted study authors and pharmaceutical manufacturers about studies on people with diabetes. We also looked for laboratory studies investigating the effects of storing human insulin above or below the manufacturers' recommended insulin temperature storage range or advised usage time, or both. We found one clinical study. Nine, three and four laboratory studies investigated storage conditions for insulin vials, insulin cartridges and prefilled plastic insulin syringes, respectively. In the clinical study, authors investigated insulin stored for six weeks in an unglazed clay pot or in a refrigerator. Outside temperatures were between 34 °C and 43 °C, and clay pot temperatures were between 25 °C and 27 °C. The study authors only reported on the glucose level in the blood of eight healthy volunteers after injecting clay-pot-stored insulin or refrigerator-stored insulin. Insulin in the clay pot had similar glucose-lowering activity to insulin in a refrigerator.
Laboratory studies on prefilled syringes stored at 4 °C to 23 °C for up to 28 days showed no clinically relevant loss of insulin activity.
Nine laboratory studies examined unopened vials and cartridges. In studies with no clinically relevant loss of insulin activity, temperatures ranged between 28.9 °C and 37 °C for up to four months. Two studies reported a more pronounced loss of insulin activity after one week to 28 days at 37 °C. Four studies examined opened vials and cartridges at up to 37 °C for up to 12 weeks, and showed no clinically relevant reduction in insulin activity.
Two laboratory studies analysed storage conditions for shifting temperatures between 25 °C and 37 °C up to 12 weeks, resembling daytime and night-time fluctuations in tropical countries. There was no loss of insulin activity for short-acting, intermediate-acting and mixed insulin (a combination of short-acting and intermediate-acting human insulin).
Four laboratory studies, two on vials, one of them on opened vials, and two on prefilled syringes, investigated sterility and reported no bacterial contamination.
Four manufacturers provided previously unpublished temperature and storage conditions data. If unopened human insulin vials or cartridges were stored at up to 25 °C for a maximum of six months or at up to 37 °C for a maximum of two months, only small amounts of insulin activity were lost. We could not include the provided data from the manufacturer Sanofi because the company announced the permanent discontinuation of the production of human insulins called Insuman Rapid, Basal and Comb 25.
If no reliable refrigeration is possible, room temperature can be lowered using simple cooling devices such as clay pots for insulin storage.
There were no data for cold environmental conditions or insulin pumps. Data on the quality of human insulin in unopened vials and cartridges appeared reliable. However, most data came from laboratory studies, and we were unable to assess the certainty of evidence because there are currently no validated methods for doing so. More studies should investigate the possible bacterial contamination risk of in-use insulin vials and cartridges. Also, clinical studies in particular are needed to inform on temperature and storing conditions for insulin outside the official recommendations. This evidence is up to date as of 12 July 2023.
For people with chronic uncomplicated aortic dissection, there is uncertainty about whether stent grafting in addition to best medical therapy improves patient outcomes. This review identified a single trial that randomised 140 patients with uncomplicated chronic type B aortic dissection to medical treatment alone or medical treatment plus stenting. The trial was methodologically sound but did not show a meaningful difference in two-year survival between the two treatment options. The number of deaths observed in the trial did not meet the number expected from registry data, so the trial was underpowered for that end point. Longer-term data from the trial are awaited. Over 20% of the patients initially randomised to the optimal medical care group 'crossed over' to receive TEVAR or open surgery because of the degree of expansion of the aorta with medical therapy alone.
The update identified no new studies. The review includes 47 RCTs representing 1,223,856 children. Studies took place in 19 countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, 16 of which were in India; 8 (17%) in Africa; 7 (15%) in Latin America, and 2 (4%) in Australia. About one-third of the studies were in urban/periurban settings, and half were in rural settings; the remaining studies did not clearly report settings. The average age of the children was about 33 months. Most studies included equal numbers of boys and girls and lasted about one year. The quality of the included studies was variable; however, it was unlikely that death rates were influenced by potential errors in the conduct of the studies. The data on the effect of VAS for the prevention of death were available from 19 of the included studies, and the combined results indicate that VAS reduces overall risk of death and death due to diarrhoea by 12%. VAS does not specifically reduce death due to measles, respiratory infections, or meningitis, but it can reduce new occurrences of diarrhoea and measles. There was no effect on incidence of respiratory disease or admissions to hospital due to diarrhoea or pneumonia. Giving oral synthetic vitamin A to children at risk of VAD reduces the risk of night blindness and tiny flakes of protein in the eye called Bitot's spots. It also improves levels of vitamin A in their blood. The only reported side effect was risk of vomiting within 48 hours of taking vitamin A in large doses, as recommended by the World Health Organization. We rated the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach, which considers methodological flaws within studies, consistency in reporting of results across studies, extent to which results apply to other settings, and effectiveness of treatments. Based on these criteria, we judged the overall certainty of evidence to be high for benefits of VAS against overall risk of death and death due to diarrhoea. For the other outcomes, we rated the evidence as low or moderate. One large, recently conducted study, which included about one million children, did not show any effect of VAS; however, when this study was combined with other, well-conducted studies, VAS still had beneficial effects for the prevention of death and illness. In summary, VAS can reduce risk of illness and death in children aged 6 to 59 months of age who are at risk of VAD. This update did not identify and new eligible studies and the conclusions remain the same.
Based on the 16 studies identified, there is limited and very low quality evidence of benefit for all of a diverse collection of exercise and mobilisation interventions for improving symptoms, functional ability (for example hand grip strength), quality of life, and neurophysiologic parameters, and for minimising adverse effects and the need for surgery in people with carpal tunnel syndrome. More research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of exercises and mobilisation for people with carpal tunnel syndrome, especially the sustainability and long-term effects of this treatment.
We included only studies in which chance determined whether people got a targeted drug or other targeted drug, and which were reported in medical literature up to 18 June 2020. Most of the studies examined the effects on kidney cancer growth (called progression), survival (life expectancy) and serious unwanted effects. We found 18 studies that answered our review question. Participants included in these trials had metastatic (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) or advanced cancer that could not be removed by surgery. We reported up-to-date comparisons that are most important to doctors and participants. Pazopanib may make little to no difference in progression, survival, and serious unwanted effects compared to sunitinib. Sunitinib probably results in more progression but may make little to no difference on death and serious unwanted effects compared to avelumab and axitinib. Sunitinib probably results in more progression and death but may slightly reduce serious unwanted effects compared to pembrolizumab and axitinib. Sunitinib may result in more progression and serious unwanted effects compared to nivolumab and ipilimumab. Sunitinib results in more deaths compared to combinations. The certainty of the evidence for most outcomes was low to high, meaning that there is some uncertainty regarding the findings. Nevertheless, there is sufficient data for us to make definitive conclusions regarding how these drugs should be used in the management of patients with kidney cancer which has spread.
We searched medical databases up until February 2014 to find studies comparing warmed fluids with unwarmed fluids and other methods of warming the patient. We found 24 relevant trials with 1250 adult patients undergoing all types of surgery. We did not include studies for which it was intended that the patient would become cold (such as to facilitate heart bypass surgery). We had intended to collect data on which patients became hypothermic (when their body temperature dropped to below 36 degrees Celsius), but no trials reported this, so we collected data on patient temperatures at various time points throughout surgery.
We found evidence of moderate quality showing that if patients had the fluids they were given into their veins warmed up, they were about half a degree Celsius warmer and shivered less than those who received unwarmed fluids; however, we were unable to show a significant difference in patients who received warmed fluids to wash out parts of their bodies.
We have demonstrated that warming fluids does keep adult patients warmer; however it is unclear whether this alone can make a difference in the severe complications that becoming cold may cause.
We wanted to find out what tools are available for middle-aged adults (aged 45 to 65 years), and how well they predict dementia later in life (at least five years after the initial assessment). We looked for tools that included risk factors widely accepted to be linked to dementia onset. We searched for studies that evaluated tools used in middle-aged adults to identify those at high risk of dementia later in life. We investigated how well these tools predicted future dementia based on an accuracy value. If the accuracy value is more than a recommended standard of 0.75, we can say that the tool is accurate at predicting future dementia. It is also important to establish that a tool developed in one group of people (in the original development study) can accurately predict dementia in another group of people (in validation studies); only then can it be applied in routine healthcare practice. We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We found 20 studies that described 14 different tools for dementia prediction. The tools included between two and 11 modifiable risk factors for dementia. Seven of the tools featured in two or more studies and were considered validated. Seven studies used a tool called Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Ageing, and Dementia (CAIDE). The CAIDE tool included current measures of a person's blood pressure, weight and height, cholesterol level, and frequency of exercise to predict future dementia. The combined accuracy value across the studies was 0.71, not high enough for us to consider CAIDE a reliable tool for predicting future dementia. Half (seven) of the tools were used in a single study, so we were unable to measure how well they predicted future dementia. Most studies provided too little information for us to assess accuracy values. The evidence is up-to-date to June 2022.
This review found that nursing programmes and interventions to manage breathlessness may produce beneficial effects and that some psychotherapeutic, psychosocial and educational interventions can play some role in improving the quality of life of patients. Counselling may help patients to cope better with emotional symptoms and reflexology can have some short-term beneficial effects. The main limitations of the included studies were the variability of the interventions, the way results were measured and the lack of 'blinding' (ensuring that those who are measuring the patients' outcomes are not aware of which treatment the patient actually received).
The evidence is current to April 2015. This review found nine studies (1069 participants of both genders, including children, adults and older people from the USA, Japan, Belgium and Denmark) that compared various NSAIDs either with each other or with an inactive substance that has no treatment value (placebo). Our findings suggest that NSAIDs may improve most analgesia-related symptoms caused by the common cold (headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain), but there is no clear evidence that NSAIDs are effective in improving coughs and runny noses caused by the common cold. Some of the included trials reported gastrointestinal complaints, rash and oedema (fluid retention) in the NSAIDs group. The quality of the evidence may be estimated as 'moderate' because of imprecision. The major limitations of this review are that the results of the studies are quite diverse and the number of studies for each outcome is quite small. NSAIDs are somewhat effective in relieving the discomfort caused by a cold but there is no clear evidence of their effect in easing respiratory symptoms. The balance of benefit and harms needs to be considered when using NSAIDs for colds.
The evidence is current to 9 November 2018. In this update, we included 10 retrospective cohort studies with a total of 864 participants, and one randomized controlled trial (RCT: a study in which participants are randomly allocated to the treatment groups), including 60 participants. The target population was individuals, regardless of age, who received a temporary or permanent enterostomy for any reason in either the elective (planned) or the emergency setting. The results found inconclusive results between the two techniques for the risk of parastomal herniation (11 studies, 924 participants), stomal prolapse (1 study, 145 participants), ileus or stenosis (1 study, 60 participants), and skin irritation (1 study, 60 participants).
Neither technique was found to be better than the other for any of the stoma-related outcomes of interest.
None of the studies measured other stoma-related problems, or death. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low, because of high risk of bias, small sample sizes, few events, and diversity across studies. Based on the current knowledge presented in this review, there is no evidence to support the use of one stoma formation technique over the other. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect.
The review authors made a thorough search of the medical literature looking for controlled studies on people with blood clots in their veins comparing blood thinning drugs (anticoagulants) with drugs to reduce inflammation (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or dummy treatment (placebo). Only two small studies with a total of 113 participants treated over three months were identified, which gave inconclusive results. Since the use of anticoagulants is widely accepted in clinical practice, designing and implementing other similar studies would not be ethical.
Womb (uterine/endometrial) cancer is a fairly common disease affecting approximately 1 in 70 women. A hysterectomy is usually curative because most cancers have a low risk of spreading (metastasising) to other sites which may result in a later recurrence. Microscopic examination of the hysterectomy specimen can tell doctors if there is a high risk of the cancer returning and this allows women to decide if they want further preventative treatment (adjuvant therapy) to reduce the risk. Chemotherapy can increase cure rates for other types of high-risk cancer after initial surgery and this review examines the effectiveness of chemotherapy for primary womb cancer after hysterectomy. Data from nine high quality randomised clinical trials involving up to 2197 women were subjected to systematic statistical modelling. This shows that chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrent disease, lengthens the duration women have before a metastasis is diagnosed and improves survival rates. There are many ways to examine the data. The subset analysis that excluded old fashioned drug regimens suggests that chemotherapy reduces the risk of being dead at any nominated time by a quarter. The number of women who would need to have need chemotherapy to prevent one death depends on the type of cancer. In these trials, one woman was cured for every 25 women treated with high dose platinum based chemotherapy after hysterectomy. This is an absolute risk reduction of 4%. Chemotherapy is associated with a greater survival advantage than radiotherapy and has added value when used with radiotherapy. It also appears to reduce the absolute risk of developing a recurrence outside the pelvis by about 5%. This would benefit one woman in every 20 treated. However, chemotherapy has side effects, risks and temporarily reduces a woman's quality of life. In many cases, the small reduction in the cancer recurrence risk may not be worth the side effects of adjuvant treatment.
The evidence was current to March 2012. We analysed 17 comparisons of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy. Some trials examined physical conditioning in addition to care as usual versus care as usual only, and others compared physical conditioning to other types of interventions such as standard exercise therapy. Participants had either acute back pain (duration of symptoms less than six weeks), subacute back pain (duration of symptoms more than six but less than 12 weeks), or chronic back pain (duration of symptoms more than 12 weeks). Participants were followed for anywhere from three weeks to three years. We divided physical conditioning into light or intense, depending on its intensity and duration. Results showed that light physical conditioning has no effect on sickness absence duration for workers with subacute or chronic back pain. We found conflicting results for intense physical conditioning for workers with subacute back pain. Intense physical conditioning probably had a small effect on reducing sick leave at 12 months follow-up compared to usual care for workers with chronic back pain. Involving the workplace, or physical conditioning being part of integrated care management may have had a positive effect on reducing sick leave, but this needs further research. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Although 16 of the included studies were well designed and had no major flaws, some studies were poorly conducted and the small number of participants in most studies lowered the overall quality of the evidence.
We wanted to determine the benefits and harms of exercise in adults after liver transplantation. We searched medical databases for well-designed clinical trials in liver transplantation recipients comparing any type of exercise with no exercise, sham interventions, or another type of exercise. We found three randomised clinical trials with 241 participants, of which 199 participants stayed until the end of the trial. A randomised trial is a study where participants are allocated at random (due to chance alone) to an experimental or a control group. The trials were conducted in the USA, Spain, and Turkey. The durations of the exercise were two, six, and 10 months in the different trials. All trials compared exercise-based interventions against usual care. All trials included adults who had received liver transplantation. The three trials assessed various exercise interventions (i.e. aerobic or resistance-based exercises, or both), and with different types of supervision and format (i.e. supervised or not, individual-based or group-based exercise). Aerobic exercise refers to the type of repetitive, structured physical activity that requires the body's metabolic system to use oxygen to produce energy. Aerobic exercise is a sustained exercise that increases blood flow to the muscles, strengthening the cardiovascular system and lungs. Resistance training or strength training is a form of physical activity that is designed to improve muscular fitness by exercising a muscle or a muscle group against external resistance. Different forms of resistance training include using free weights, weight machines, resistance bands, and the person's own bodyweight. Usual care consisted of traditional medical intervention with or without recommendations to remain active. The trial sites were at the hospital or at home.
Two trials received funding; one from the National Center for Research Resources and the other from Instituto de Salud Carlos III. The other trial did not receive funding.
We also identified three ongoing trials. We are very uncertain whether exercise compared with usual care has a beneficial or harmful effect on death from any cause. Two studies reported eight deaths, which were more frequent in the exercise group. We are very uncertain whether exercise compared with usual care has a beneficial or harmful effect on health-related quality of life at the end of the intervention. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference in effect between exercise versus usual care on aerobic capacity (which indicates the level of cardiovascular (blood vessels and heart) fitness) at the end of the intervention. We are very uncertain whether exercise has an effect regarding muscle strength in people after liver transplantation. One trial reported a higher perception of fatigue in the exercise group.
The trials did not report data on serious or non-serious side effects. However, all trials reported that there were no side effects associated with participants who performed exercise. None of the trials reported data on other cardiovascular measures. Caution is needed in interpreting the review findings as the number of included trials is very limited and there were few data provided. We have little confidence in the evidence because it is highly possible that most trials chose to present a subset of results from their study by omitting complete outcomes, as well as in two studies hat presented only a selective dropout of some participants who differed from those who remained in the study. We also found that data on clinically important outcomes were lacking. We are not confident in the evidence of the effect of exercise training that included aerobic, resistance-based exercises, or a combination of both on physical function (that is, aerobic capacity and muscle strength) in liver transplant recipients due to its high uncertainty. We need larger trials with blinded outcome assessment (process of concealing treatment group identity from outcome assessors), designed according to guidance of clinical trial protocols and recommendations for reporting randomised trials. The review includes trials published by 2 September 2022.
We wanted to find out whether non-medicinal ways of trying to improve sleep work better than usual care or other methods in hospitalized children.
We wanted to look at how well these different methods worked on:
- the quality and quantity of sleep in the children;
- child and parent satisfaction;
- length of time for which breathing was supported by a ventilator (ventilator support);
- delirium;
- cost-effectiveness;
- length of hospital stay; and
- mortality.
We also wanted to find out if non-medicinal methods were associated with any unwanted effects. We looked for studies that compared non-medicinal methods for improving sleep with usual care, or other methods in children in hospital.
We compared and summarized the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes. We found 10 trials from three countries, which involved 528 children and young people (aged from 4 to 22 years). Eight studies were funded by non-profit organizations or government sources.
All the children and young people were staying in hospital for more than 48 hours on regular wards, or in children’s intensive care units. The methods used to try to improve sleep included behavioral interventions (relaxation, including music, reading, and quiet time; touch therapy, and massage), and physical activity interventions.
There were many differences between studies in the participants, the methods used to measure the quantity and quality of sleep, and the way the results were analyzed. As a result, we could not combine the findings of trials that investigated similar methods; instead, we provided a descriptive summary.
Behavioral interventions
Studies that combined methods of relaxation found that these may make little or no difference on the amount or quality of sleep compared to usual care.
Touch therapy may improve total sleep time and sleep quality in children with burns. Massage and bedtime stories may also improve sleep. However, we have little confidence in these results, because of differences in the study populations and the measurement methods they used.
Children and parents may be satisfied with both massage and multicomponent relaxation methods for improving sleep. However, we are not confident about this result, as the people in the studies knew which sleep-improving method they received, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about their results.
We did not identify any studies that reported length of ventilator support, delirium, cost-effectiveness, length of hospital stay, or mortality.
Physical activity interventions
One study showed that using a stationary (exercise) bicycle to improve sleep may not improve total sleep time or quality of sleep compared to usual care. Another study investigated whether organized play improved sleep; it found inconsistent results for boys and girls, and for children in different age groups. No study evaluated child or parent satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, delirium, length of ventilator support, length of hospital stay, or mortality. We did not identify any studies that reported the effects of complementary interventions, such as aromatherapy, acupressure, or acupuncture.
We did not identify any studies for any intervention that reported length of ventilator support, delirium, cost-effectiveness, length of hospital stay, or mortality.
We are not confident in any of these results; it is possible that these results would change if we had more evidence. This evidence is current to December 2021.
We wanted to find out if taking vitamin B12 supplements during pregnancy would improve the health and nutrition of women and their babies. We searched for clinical trials that looked at vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the information, based on factors such as trial methods and sizes. We included five trials with 984 pregnant women. Three trials, including 609 pregnant women, had data included in analyses. Women who took vitamin B12 supplements during pregnancy had less vitamin B12 deficiency and higher vitamin B12 levels compared to women who did not take vitamin B12 supplements, but the evidence is uncertain. There were no differences between groups for maternal anaemia. We could not assess the effects of vitamin B12 supplementation on other outcomes such as miscarriage, neural tube defects, and child cognition (a child's ability to gain knowledge through thought, understanding, and the senses) due to limited or no availability of results for analysis. The small number of trials and small size of trials were limitations in this review. Not all the trials provided data about the outcomes we were interested in. We are very unsure about the results. The evidence is up to date as of June 2023.
We included 13 studies involving 1021 participants with varicose veins who had not experienced venous ulceration in this review (search run May 2020). Five studies assessed compression stocking versus no compression stocking (for example no treatment or placebo stocking with no graduated elastic). Three of these studies used knee-length stockings, one used full-length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee-length stockings. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure. One study included only pregnant women, while other studies included people who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology (skin care) clinics or outpatient departments. Participants considered their symptoms had improved when stockings were worn in the nine studies that assessed this outcome, but these assessments were not always made by comparing one treatment group of the trial with a control group in the same study and was therefore subject to bias.
Two studies comparing stockings with placebo stockings measured physical signs; there was no clear difference between baseline and follow-up for ankle circumference, while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Generally there were no clear differences between studies comparing two types of stockings for volume reduction and change in diameter (ways to measure oedema).
Complications or side effects ranged from sweating, itching, irritation, skin dryness and a feeling of tightness. There were no severe or long-lasting side effects.
Two studies comparing stockings with different stockings, and four studies comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed compliance (whether the person used the stockings as directed). In the stocking versus different stocking studies, there was no clear difference between the stockings, with generally low levels of compliance reported. In the stocking versus placebo/no treatment group, three studies reported results. Of these, one study reported a high initial dropout rate with generally low levels of compliance. The other two studies reported generally good compliance in the stocking group. Some reasons provided for non-compliance included discomfort, difficulty in putting the stockings on, appearance, not being effective and causing irritation.
Four studies that compared stockings with different stockings and two studies that compared stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed comfort, tolerance and acceptability of stockings. Comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment, comfort, tolerance and acceptability was affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in a study of non-pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. In the stocking versus different stockings studies, two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between the types of stocking. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another.
One study assessed quality of life, showing no clear differences between the stocking and no stocking groups.
No conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low because of risk of bias due to poor reporting, not all studies assessed the same outcomes, they assessed them in different ways, or reported them in a way that they could be combined and analysed with other studies. Evidence from available trials is not sufficient to determine if compression stockings as the only and initial treatment are effective in managing and treating varicose veins in the early stages.
The evidence is current to January 2013. We included 16 studies covering 697 participants with MCI. The studies have been published over a 14-year period (1999 to 2013). Study sizes were small and ranged from 19 to 94 participants. Five papers have a mean age of less than 70 years. The age range in the youngest sample was 55 to 73 years and in the oldest sample was 71 to 86 years. Participants were mainly recruited from university departments, clinics or research centres. The percentage of participants with positive ¹⁸F-FDG PET scans at baseline ranged in the included studies from 10.5% to 74% and the percentage of those participants who converted to Alzheimer’s disease dementia over a period of time ranged from 22% to 50%. Included studies reported a range of different cut-off values used for identifying their participants with positive ¹⁸F-FDG PET scans. Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting. The majority of included studies had an unclear risk of bias, mainly because they did not describe in sufficient details how participants were selected and how the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease dementia was justified. According to the assessment of the ¹⁸F-FDG PET test domain, more than 50% of studies were of poor methodological quality.
The main limitations of the review are poor reporting in the included studies, a lack of a widely-accepted cut-off value of the ¹⁸F-FDG PET scan in people with MCI, and the marked variation in test accuracy between the included studies. In this review, we have found that the ¹⁸F-FDG PET scan, as a single test, lacks the accuracy to identify those people with MCI who would develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time. Assuming a typical conversion rate of MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia of 38%, the findings indicate that for every 1000 ¹⁸F-FDG PET scans, 174 cases with a negative scan will progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 285 with a positive scan will not. Therefore, a positive ¹⁸F-FDG PET scan in people with MCI is of no clinical value in early prediction of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia.
We found 65 studies involving 1951 participants.
All studies included participants with spatial neglect as a result of stroke. It is surprising that only one study included three participants with spatial neglect caused by another type of brain injury.
All studies included participants with right-sided damage to the brain; seven studies also included participants with left-sided damage.
Studies were considered small, with 4 to 69 participants (average 30). Eight studies included 50 or more participants; four studies involved 10 or fewer.
None of the studies reported any patient or public involvement in how the studies were designed, conducted, or reported.
We categorised the studies into eight different types of treatments.
• Visual treatment: 17 studies involving 398 participants explored visual treatments. All treatments encouraged eye movement or scanning by a range of methods including paper-based tasks, computer activities, and daily living activities.
• Prism adaptation training: 8 studies involving 257 participants explored prism adaptation training. This involved participants wearing glasses with prism lenses during a pointing activity.
• Body awareness treatments: 12 studies involving 447 participants explored body awareness treatments. These studies involved various physical, visual, or verbal prompting or cueing aimed at increasing awareness of the affected side.
• Mental function treatments: 7 studies involving 170 participants explored treatments that focused on mental processing/thinking (e.g. mental imagery, virtual reality).
• Movement treatments: 6 studies involving 220 participants explored treatments that used movement of the arm or the whole body. These included the use of robotics, visual and motor feedback, and restricting movement on the side of the body that was not affected.
• Non-invasive brain stimulation: 17 studies involving 467 participants explored non-invasive brain stimulation. These involved different methods of applying electrical or magnetic stimulation to the skull to change brain activity.
• Electrical stimulation: 8 studies involving 270 participants explored electrical stimulation to other parts of the body. These involved sending mild electrical impulses to a particular part of the body (e.g. the arm). Four different types of electrical stimulation were used.
• Acupuncture: 2 studies involving 104 participants explored the use of acupuncture. These involved inserting thin needles into specific points in the body. We rated the evidence on use of these treatments and found it to be of very low quality due to:
• the small size of studies;
• differences between studies within each of the eight treatment categories, including participant characteristics, types of treatments, and assessments used to measure changes; and
• concerns about how participants were randomised, and whether people carrying out the assessments were "blinded" (i.e. knew which treatment each patient received). Most studies used standard tests of spatial neglect. Many also measured effects on daily living activities soon after treatment, but very few reports described longer-term effects.
Other meaningful treatment outcomes were rarely reported.
Overall we found only very low-quality evidence about whether these treatments had benefits or harms for people with spatial neglect. Despite 65 (small) trials, the benefits or risks of non-drug treatments for reducing neglect and increasing independence remain unknown. It would be a mistake to interpret this review as concluding that the proposed treatments are ineffective. Rather, we conclude that evidence for or against any treatment used within randomised trials conducted worldwide is insufficient. Future trials must be of much higher quality to answer important clinical questions. One way to improve research quality is to involve patients in designing and running the trial. Clinicians should continue to follow national clinical guidelines and are strongly encouraged to participate in trials. People with spatial neglect should continue to receive general stroke or neurological rehabilitation that enables them to meet their rehabilitation goals, including any available intervention for neglect. People with spatial neglect should also have the opportunity to take part in high-quality research.
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing the antiepileptic medication, topiramate, with placebo (a pretend treatment) or another antiepileptic drug in people with JME. We wanted to evaluate how well topiramate worked and if it had any side effects. We included and analyzed three randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 83 participants. Based on the information in these trials, it seems that topiramate is better tolerated than valproate, but is no more effective than valproate. Topiramate seemed to work better than placebo, but this result was based on a small number of included people. The quality of the evidence from the studies was very low and the results should be interpreted with caution. More randomized controlled trials with large numbers of participants are required to test how effective and well tolerated topiramate is in people with JME. Future trials should be well-designed and double-blinded (where neither the participant nor the researcher know which treatment has been given until after the results have been collected). This review does not provide sufficient evidence to support topiramate for the treatment of people with JME.
The evidence is current to August 2021.
We judged our certainty of the evidence as 'moderate' for overall survival and progression-free survival in the analyses involving primary debulking surgery studies. For the interval debulking surgery studies, the certainty of evidence was very low for overall survival in all comparisons and those that involved progression-free survival. This was largely due to all but one study including 'no macroscopic residual disease' in the small-volume residual disease category. The evidence in the review suggests that following primary debulking surgery three categories for the amount of residual disease should be used: no macroscopic residual disease, small-volume and large-volume residual disease. The evidence is more limited for interval debulking surgery and further studies are needed, but there may not be a survival difference between those with small- and large-volume residual disease. Until there is evidence for a survival benefit for those with small-volume compared to large-volume residual disease, it may only be important to use two residual disease categories when classifying surgical outcomes: 'no macroscopic residual disease' and 'macroscopic residual disease' (remaining visible disease of more than 0 cm). However, this is based on very low-certainty evidence and more information may change this finding.
Review authors included 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (1215 women) but could not obtain data from three studies. In addition, several completed registered trials had not yet reported findings. This review evaluated results of 11 RCTs that included 1021 women with fibroids. Investigators treated women with mifepristone (five studies), ulipristal acetate (four studies) or asoprisnil (two studies) and compared SPRMs with either placebo or leuprolide acetate. More than half of these studies were at low risk of bias in all domains. The most common limitation of the other studies was poor reporting of methods. The main outcomes studied were changes in symptoms (fibroid-related symptom severity, quality of life, menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain). When compared with placebo (identical "dummy" tablet that contains no active medication), SPRMs improved fibroid-related symptoms (by an average effect of 20 points on a 100-point scale), improved women's quality of life (by an average effect of 22 points on a 100-point scale) and resulted in a small decrease in menstrual bleeding. Between 24% and 96% of women treated with SPRMs had no period at all (compared with 3% taking placebo). Review authors could draw no conclusions about changes in pelvic pain, as this was not consistently evaluated. Two studies compared SPRMs versus a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide) and found that both drugs (SPRMs and leuprolide) were effective in improving symptoms related to fibroids (improving quality of life, reducing menstrual bleeding, causing cessation of periods, decreasing pelvic pain). However, we are not sure if researchers noted a difference in effectiveness between SPRMs and leuprolide.
Women treated with SPRMs were more likely to develop changes to the lining of the womb (endometrium) than women treated with placebo or leuprolide. These changes are benign and reversible once SPRMs are discontinued.
In summary, the studies included in this review show that SPRMs improve fibroid-related symptoms, quality of life and menstrual bleeding. However, we need larger, well-designed studies comparing SPRMs against other treatments currently available for the management of fibroids. In comparisons with placebo, moderate-quality evidence showed improvements in quality of life, reduction in menstrual bleeding and cessation of periods with SPRMs. Low-quality evidence suggested a higher rate of changes to the endometrium with SPRM treatment than with placebo. Comparisons with leuprolide were based on moderate-quality evidence for changes in quality of life, cessation of periods, pelvic pain and endometrial changes. The main limitation in the overall quality of evidence was potential publication bias.
We assessed whether the use of inotropic agents before or during the surgical procedure prevented reduced heart function and death in adults after heart surgery. We searched different medical literature databases and trial registers that collect information about planned, ongoing, and completed clinical studies. We considered studies in which one group had received an inotropic agent and a second group had received another inotropic drug or a sham medication or standard care. Two review authors independently screened and collected the data.  We identified 29 studies that had a total of 3307 adult patients of both sexes who had heart surgery. The studies were conducted in different hospitals in Europe, Israel, Japan, Korea, Turkey, Canada, and the USA. Nine studies were funded by the manufacturer of the investigated drug. In 10 studies, the relationship to the pharmaceutical industry was not determined. When we asked all of the study authors for additional information about their studies, only one author responded.
The majority of the studies (24 in total) dealt with the inotropic drug levosimendan. So, the available data did not allow us to judge agents other than levosimendan. The participants were given the drug before, during, or immediately after heart surgery. They were monitored for up to 30 days. Patients treated with levosimendan prior to heart surgery possibly have a lower risk of reduced heart function and death and may spend less time in intensive care compared to patients receiving a sham medication. However, the available data revealed no clear difference between levosimendan and standard care or treatment with another inotropic drug in preventing reduced heart function and death and reducing time spent in intensive care after heart surgery. The available data also showed no clear differences in the prevention of adverse events between levosimendan and comparator treatment. We have little confidence in the evidence, mainly because of the small number of included participants (the results are very imprecise). Thus, most results of the review must be viewed with caution. This evidence is up-to-date to October 2022.
The evidence to support treatments for preventing lactation is limited. The review authors identified 62 controlled trials that randomised a total of 6428 mothers to receive the treatment under investigation, no treatment or another treatment. Twenty-two trials did not contribute data to the meta-analyses. The trials were generally of limited quality and most were conducted among healthy women who chose not to breastfeed for personal reasons at hospitals in industrialised countries before 1980. Half of the trials involved bromocriptine. Two trials (107 women) reported that taking bromocriptine was better than no treatment in suppressing lactation in the first week after giving birth. The 11 trials using oestrogen preparations (diethylstilbestrol, quinestrol, chlorotrianisene, hexestrol) also showed suppression of lactation. A combination of testosterone and oestrogen preparations was of some benefit in reducing symptoms in three trials (436 women). Other pharmacologic agents (clomiphene, tamoxifen, prostaglandins, pyridoxine, oxytocin, L-dopa and homeopathic preparation) were tested in single small trials. Generally, side effects were poorly reported and no case of thromboembolism was recorded among trials that included it as an adverse treatment outcome. Most of the drugs tested are currently not available or registered for suppressing lactation. No trials compared non-drug approaches with no treatment and none of the included trials provided reliable data on women’s satisfaction with the treatment.
We found seven very small randomised controlled trials (where people taking part in the trial had equal chances of being in the treatment or the control group), involving 291 people with NTDβT, aged between two and 49 years, from five countries. These studies varied widely in the type of HbF inducers investigated and their comparison, the doses and how outcomes were reported. The duration of the trials ranged from two to six months. The inducers used include hydroxyurea, decitabine, HQK-1001, thalidomide, Radix Astragali, resveratrol, l-carnitine and combined natural preparation (CNP). None of the studies reported our main outcome of changes to the frequency of blood transfusion.
All inducers may have caused a small increase in haemoglobin and HbF when compared to placebo, but we are very uncertain about this.
Four studies compared a single HbF inducer against another, for three to six months. There were changes to haemoglobin and HbF, but we cannot be certain if a single HbF inducer or a combination of HbF inducers would work better than another.
Two studies, each compared a different dose of the same inducer. Lower doses of hydroxyurea appeared to increase haemoglobin and HbF levels more than the higher doses, but we are very uncertain. The other study used four different doses of HQK-1001 but did not actually look for a difference in the effect of these four different doses on haemoglobin or HbF.
Two studies compared a combination of two HbF inducers with a single HbF inducer for six months. We are very uncertain whether the combination or a single inducer improves haemoglobin.
None of the studies reported whether HbF inducers have any effect on quality of life.
Adverse (unwanted) drug effects were reported for each HbF inducer, but there was little information available to guide us on the safety of these substances. The main reason we are very uncertain about the effects of HbF inducers are because the studies were all very small and had weaknesses in their design. None of the studies lasted long enough to provide meaningful information for many of the outcomes we measured. The evidence is current to 21 August 2022.
We searched for evidence in April 2016 and identified two randomised controlled studies (involving 142 women and their babies). Both studies were conducted in Italy (and were judged to be at an unclear risk of bias). The women were diagnosed with GDM at 12 to 13 weeks' gestation in one study and at 26 weeks' gestation in the other. The findings from these trials suggested that myo-inositol can reduce fasting blood glucose levels. The need for supplementary insulin was not clearly different between the women receiving myo-inositol and the control groups. One of the studies showed reduced glucose levels at one hour after a meal (one study, 73 women) There was no evidence to suggest that the babies were at reduced risk of being born large-for-gestational age (one study, 73 infants). Myo-inositol appeared to reduce the risk of the baby having low blood sugar levels at birth and being born at a later gestational age, although the evidence was of low quality. Many of the infant and maternal outcomes identified as being of interest for this review were not reported in the included studies - these included: high blood pressure during the pregnancy, caesarean section, the development of type 2 diabetes (maternal), and the number of babies who died or were unwell, or the number of babies with neurosensory disability. No long-term outcomes were reported for the mother, infant as a child, infant as an adult or health service outcomes. Because of the limited number of studies reporting on myo-inositol for the treatment of women with GDM, lack of data on the outcomes of importance for this review and the low-quality evidence based on two small studies, we cannot be certain if myo-inositol is useful as a treatment intervention for women with GDM. The available evidence is insufficient to support the use of myo-inositol. Further high-quality trials with large sample sizes are required to investigate the role of myo-inositol as a treatment or a co-treatment for women with gestational diabetes.
There are beds, mattresses and mattress toppers specifically designed for people at risk of pressure ulcers. These can be made of a range of materials (such as foam, air cells or water bags) and are divided into two groups:
- reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin, unless a person moves or is repositioned; and
- active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body.
We wanted to find out if active, air-filled surfaces:
- prevent pressure ulcers;
- are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
- have health benefits that outweigh their costs (cost-effectiveness); and
- have any unwanted effects. We searched the medical literature for studies that evaluated the effects of beds, mattresses and mattress toppers with an active, air-filled surface. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 32 studies (9058 people, average age: 69 years) that lasted between three and 180 days (average: 14 days). The studies compared active, air-filled surfaces with:
- foam, fibre, water-filled or gel surfaces; and
- other air-filled surfaces.
Pressure ulcer prevention
The evidence suggests that active, air-filled surfaces may reduce the risk of pressure ulcers developing when compared with:
- foam surfaces;
- gel surfaces used on operating tables followed by foam surfaces used on hospitals beds, for people who undergo surgery.
However, active, air-filled surfaces may increase the risk of pressure ulcers developing when compared with reactive air surfaces (1 study, 308 nursing home residents, duration: 14 days).
It is unclear if active air-filled surfaces prevent pressure ulcers compared with surfaces other than reactive foam, gel or air-filled surfaces.
The type of active, air-filled surface used may make little to no difference for preventing pressure ulcers.
Other effects
Active, air-filled surfaces are probably more cost-effective than foam. Mattresses with an active, air-filled surface are probably more cost-effective than mattress toppers with the same surface.
We did not find sufficiently robust and clear evidence to determine how active, air-filled surfaces affect comfort, quality of life and unwanted effects. Most studies were small (83 people on average) and more than two-thirds of them (25) used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019.
Two studies took into consideration atorvastatin, while the other two analysed simvastatin. Only three studies were found of good methodological quality.
The authors did not find convincing evidence that either atorvastatin or simvastatin can reduce relapses or prevent disease progression with a follow up at one and two years. No serious adverse events were reported and statins resulted to be safe and well tolerated. At present, the whole data do not support the use of statins as an adjunctive therapy in MS.
We included 11 studies with a total of 1482 women. These trials looked at many methods: pills, an implant, the injectable 'Depo,' and a hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Some older reports did not have much data. Most trials showed no major difference due to hormonal birth control use. Two of eight trials noted less breastfeeding among women using hormonal birth control. One was a combined pill with few results and the other a hormonal IUD. In one study, the implant group infants gained more weight than those in the no-method group but less weight than infants in the 'Depo' group. Two trials noted that a combined pill had a negative effect on breast milk volume or content. One report did not have much data. The other showed lower volume for combined pill users than for women taking pills with only progestin.
We found little information on any specific birth control method, with usually two studies per method. Results were not consistent across all trials. The data were of moderate quality overall. The results of better quality showed little effect on breastfeeding or infant growth.
This review examined the impact of different payment systems on primary care physician behaviour. Three payment systems were included: capitation (payment is made for every patient for whom care is provided), salary, and fee for service (payment is made for every item of care provided). There was some evidence that primary care physicians provide a greater quantity of primary care services under fee for service payment compared with capitation and salary, although long-term effects are unclear. There was no evidence, however, concerning other important outcomes such as patient health status, or comparing the relative impact of salary versus capitation payment.
We identified 41 studies (around 13,000 participants) that researched ways of helping teenagers to quit smoking. These studies were of mixed quality and looked at various methods for stopping smoking, including one-to-one counselling, counselling as part of a group, methods using computers or text messaging, or a combination of these. Four studies used drug treatments such as nicotine patches. Most studies recruited participants from schools, and 29 of the studies were carried out in North America. Although some programmes showed promise, especially those that used group counselling and those that combined a variety of approaches, there was no strong evidence that any particular method was effective in helping young people to stop smoking. Trials differed in how they measured whether a person had quit smoking, and many trials did not have enough participants for us to be confident about wider application of the results. Medications such as nicotine replacement and bupropion were not shown to be successful with adolescents, and some adverse events were reported, although these events were generally mild and findings were based on studies with small numbers of participants. Based on these findings we cannot currently identify a programme for helping adolescents to stop smoking that is more successful than trying to stop unaided. The quality of evidence was low or very low for all of the outcomes in this review. This is because of issues with the quality of some of the studies, the small number of studies and participants for some outcomes, and the differences between the studies.
We wanted to know whether people resuscitated from cardiac arrest recover better when their bodies are cooled to a temperature of 32 °C to 34 °C. We searched medical databases for well-designed studies that looked at how well people who had their bodies cooled to 32 °C to 34 °C recovered after resuscitation following a cardiac arrest compared to people who were not cooled or not cooled to less than 36 °C. We included 12 studies (3956 people overall) in our analysis examining the effects of cooling the body after successful resuscitation for cardiac arrest. Eleven studies used conventional cooling methods (for example, cooling pads or ice packs). However, one study used haemofiltration as the cooling method (blood was removed from the body via a tube that passed through a filter to remove toxic substances and a cooling machine before returning to the body – similar to dialysis), so their data could not be summarised with the other studies and were treated separately in the review. Cooling the body after successful resuscitation may reduce the risk of brain damage and improve neurological outcomes. When we compared people whose bodies were cooled to 32 °C to 34 °C after resuscitation versus those whose bodies were not cooled, we found that 532 per 1000 of those receiving cooling would have no, or only minor, brain damage, while only 377 per 1000 not receiving cooling would have no, or only minor, brain damage. Cooling had no effect on survival. Cooling the body was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs) (384 per 1000 people who had cooling versus 352 per 1000 people who had no cooling), increased risk of low concentrations of blood potassium (185 per 1000 people who had cooling versus 134 per 1000 people who had no cooling) and an increased risk for irregular heartbeats (257 per 1000 people who had cooling versus 184 per 1000 people who had no cooling). Only a few studies looked at these treatable complications. Some studies had quality shortcomings including a lack of information on how these studies were carried out and the use of inadequate methods to balance participants between cooling and no cooling groups. However, when we accounted for differences between studies, it became clear that these shortcomings had only a minor impact on the main results, and they did not change the overall findings. A dialysis-related company funded the study that used external cooling. Of the remaining 11 studies included in the main analysis, five received funding from government or non-profit organisations; two received analysing kits from a company unrelated to cooling and four studies did not provide information on funding. Evidence is current to September 2022.
Through April 2014, we did computer searches for studies of birth control methods containing hormones and risk of fractures. Outcomes could also be bone mineral density or markers of bone changes. Birth control pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. Also included were implants and injectables with only progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We included randomized trials in any language that had at least three treatment cycles. The studies had to compare two types of birth control or one type of birth control or a supplement with a placebo or 'dummy' method.
We found 19 trials. Fifteen studies compared one birth control method with another hormone method. Two trials used a placebo or 'dummy.' One compared a hormone method to a method without hormones. None had fractures as an outcome and most looked at bone density. Birth control methods with both estrogen and progestin did not appear to affect bone health. However, 'depo,' which is injected and has only progestin, was related to lower bone density. The two depo trials with placebos showed increased bone density when some estrogen was given to women on depo. Bone density decreased in women who got a 'dummy' with the depo. Whether this decrease is important to the woman's health is not known. For implants, an etonogestrel implant with one rod showed a greater decrease in bone density than a two-rod levonorgestrel implant. However, other implants studied did not show the same pattern.
The studies had data of moderate quality. Whether hormonal contraceptives affect fracture risk cannot be judged from current information. These contraceptive methods work well for birth control. Health-care providers and women should think about the costs and benefits. For instance, injectable use can occur without a partner's knowledge, and is simpler than taking pills every day. Also, progestin-only methods are suggested for some women with health problems who should avoid estrogen.
We searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to a treatment group using a random method) in March 2018. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group was treated with opioids before the surgeon cut the skin, whilst the other group was given the same medication after the surgeon cut the skin. We identified 20 trials involving a total of 1343 participants aged over 15 years who were undergoing a variety of surgeries. In all but one trial, participants received general anaesthetic. Nearly all participants were low-risk patients. Only one of the trials used a pre-emptive dose of opioid. In one small trial (40 participants) involving people undergoing dental surgery, use of pre-emptive opioids resulted in a small reduction in pain experienced in the first six hours after surgery and at 24 to 48 hours based on low-quality evidence. This study did not report on adverse events or 24-hour morphine consumption.
For preventive opioids started before the first cut was made and continued over the first day after surgery, pain in the first six hours after surgery was similar to when the first opioid dose was given after the first cut to the skin (10 studies; 706 participants). Postoperative pain 24 to 48 hours after surgery was similar between groups (9 studies; 668 participants). The evidence for both these findings was of moderate quality. The following findings were supported by low- or very low-quality evidence. A reduction in 24-hour morphine consumption was too small to be clinically relevant (11 studies; 526 participants). Not all studies reported on adverse events, but the numbers of participants with respiratory depression (4 studies; 433 participants), low heart rate (2 studies; 112 participants), or low blood pressure (2 studies; 88 participants) were similar between groups. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main issues concerning the included trials were high risk of bias due to limitations in how the findings were presented, the design and conduct of the studies, and wide variations in the findings, which led to uncertainty in the results. Consequently, we found no convincing evidence that starting opioids before the beginning of surgery reduces levels of pain after surgery or the need for continuing opioids.
We searched the medical literature for clinical studies comparing the transport of adults who had major injuries by helicopter ambulance (HEMS) or ground ambulance (GEMS). The evidence is current to April 2015. We found 38 studies which included people from 12 countries around the world. Researchers wanted to find out if using a helicopter ambulance was any better than a ground ambulance for improving an injured person's chance of survival, or reducing the severity of long-term disability. Some of these studies indicated some benefit of HEMS for survival after major trauma, but other studies did not. The studies were of varying sizes and used different methods to determine if more people survived when transported by HEMS versus GEMS. Some studies included helicopter teams that had specialized physicians on board whereas other helicopter crews were staffed by paramedics and nurses. Furthermore, people transported by HEMS or GEMS had varying numbers and types of procedures during travel to the trauma center. The use of some of these procedures, such as the placement of a breathing tube, may have helped improve survival in some of the studies. However, these medical procedures can also be provided during ground ambulance transport. Data regarding safety were not available in any of the included studies. Road traffic and helicopter crashes are adverse effects which can occur with either method of transport. Overall, the quality of the included studies was low. It is possible that HEMS may be better than GEMS for people with certain characteristics. There are various reasons why HEMS may be better, such as staff having more specialty training in managing major injuries. But more research is required to determine what elements of helicopter transport improve survival. Some studies did not describe the care available to people in the GEMS group. Due to this poor reporting it is impossible to compare the treatments people received. Based on the current evidence, the added benefits of HEMS compared with GEMS are unclear. The results from future research might help in better allocation of HEMS within a healthcare system, with increased safety and decreased costs.
The review identified 17 randomised clinical trials. The trials reported on patient-relevant outcomes only occasionally. All trials had high risk of bias ie, a trial might systematically overestimate benefits or underestimate harms of the treatments). Both treatments were associated with a high risk of experiencing adverse events, which may lead to discontinuation of the treatment. Twelve trials reported on clearing the virus from blood six months after the end of treatment. A summary of the current evidence in this review suggests that peginterferon alpha-2a has higher chances of clearing the virus from the patient's blood than peginterferon alpha-2b (in 50% compared with 43%). We were unable to identify any evidence on the benefits of one peginterferon over the other on patient-important outcomes. There is lack of data regarding patient-important outcomes on this topic.
Thirteen relevant trials with 1770 participants were analysed. All of them were of low quality. None of these trials analysed mortality, health related quality of life, economic outcomes or compliance with treatments. Some of these herbs may show benefits in improving symptoms, thyroid function and adverse effects. Unfortunately, we were unable to find reliable evidence to recommend a specific herbal preparation from 103 investigated formulations.
To evaluate the usefulness of this technique, we looked for all the controlled trials that have studied it. Intrauterine insemination was compared with timed intercourse: intercourse was advised by pinpointing the most fertile time of the cycle. Five studies were found and are included in this systematic review. The outcomes of the six studies were impossible to combine due to the poor quality of the trials and variations in the participant characteristics and approaches to insemination. There is no evidence that intrauterine insemination is an effective treatment for cervical hostility. Intrauterine insemination is unlikely to be helpful in this setting.
This review included eight studies with a total of 1090 participants. All eight included studies used the femoropopliteal artery. We did not identify any studies that used the iliac arteries. All trials compared angioplasty with or without stenting plus IVBT with angioplasty with or without stenting alone. No trials were found comparing IVBT to newer technologies such as drug eluting stents, balloons, or cryoplasty. Intravascular brachytherapy resulted in increased cumulative patency, reduced restenosis, and fewer occlusions on short-term follow-ups. However, results from the eight included trials were not consistent and long-term outcomes need to be fully assessed. Therefore, more research is needed especially regarding the long-term outcomes and complications of this treatment, and the health economics and cost-effectiveness data.
From the three studies involving people with dementia or cognitive impairment and low blood levels of vitamin B12 eligible for inclusion in this review there was no statistically significant effect of vitamin B12 supplementation on cognition. The variety of measurement scales used to assess outcomes and uncertainty about diagnostic criteria for vitamin B12 deficiency create difficulties in pooling the results of trials.
The evidence is current to 21 December 2020. This review update identified 14 new studies in addition to those already in the review, so in total we included 21 studies. Ten of the studies looked at people in a stable phase (stable COPD) and four studies looked at people shortly after a COPD hospital admission (post-exacerbation COPD). All studies included men and women. For our analyses, we used data from 778 people with stable COPD and 364 people with post-exacerbation COPD. In all people with COPD who had raised levels of carbon dioxide, chronic NIV for three and 12 months improved blood gases. In stable COPD, chronic NIV also might have improved quality of life, and survival seemed to be better compared to people who were treated with standard care only. There was no relevant benefit of NIV on exercise capacity. People using chronic NIV after a COPD admission experienced less benefit; carbon dioxide levels decreased, the time to the next hospital admission might have been longer when treated with NIV but quality of life and survival were not affected by chronic NIV. Our confidence in the certainty (according to GRADE criteria) is good when looking at the blood gases. For the other outcomes, the certainty of the evidence is moderate to very low because the participants and the researcher were aware of the treatment the people received, and due to a wide range in the observed effect. This means that further research might change the results.
We searched for studies until June 2016, and found 13 studies (839 individuals). Most studies (61.5%) included only female participants. Average age of participants was 41 years (minimum 32 to maximum 56 years). According to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, most participants were not doing exercises before starting the study.
Aerobic interventions were compared with controls (wait list, treatment as usual, daily activities as usual) over six to 24 weeks. On average, exercise sessions were provided two to three times per week for 35 minutes each session. Exercises involved walking, cycling, running, and doing low-impact aerobics and aquacise. Participants exercised at different intensities, starting light and increasing as the study progressed. All programs were supervised. The findings of aerobic exercise compared with no exercise control were prioritised and are presented fully here. Moderate-quality evidence revealed that aerobic exercise improved HRQL, and low-quality evidence showed improvement in physical function and decreased pain, fatigue, and stiffness compared with control. Similar numbers of people dropped out of the aerobic interventions group and the comparison group. Minor adverse events were reported, but reporting was inconsistent in these studies.
Four studies explored long-term effects at 24 to 208 weeks after the intervention ended. They reported benefits for pain and physical function among exercisers and noted no other effects. Each outcome below was measured on a scale from 0 to 100, on which lower scores were better. People who exercised were 7% better (or 7 points, ranging from 3 to 13 points) and rated their HRQL as 48 points versus 56 points in the control group. People who exercised were 11% better (or 11 points, ranging from 4 to 18 points) and rated their pain as 56 points versus 65 points in the control group. Those who exercised were 6% better (or 6 points, ranging from 12 better to 0.3 worse) and rated their fatigue as 63 points versus 68 points in the control group. Those who exercised were 8% better (or 8 points, ranging from 1 to 15) and rated their stiffness as 61 points versus 69 points in the control group. The aerobic exercise group was 10% better (or 10 points, ranging from 15 to 5) and participants rated their physical function as 37 points versus 46 points in the control group.  A total of 20 out of 100 people dropped out of the aerobic group compared with 17 out of 100 from the control group (3% more, ranging from 3% fewer to 12% more) for any reason. We do not have precise information about adverse events associated with aerobic exercise. Some reports describe increased pain or fatigue, and one of the 496 participants doing aerobic exercise experienced a foot bone (metatarsal) stress fracture. This may have happened by chance. Evidence shows that aerobic exercise may improve HRQL, pain, stiffness, and physical function, and probably leads to similar numbers of people dropping out from each group. Aerobic exercise does not seem to improve fatigue. The quality of the evidence was considered to be low or moderate because of the small numbers of people included in the studies, some issues involving study design, and low certainty of results.
The results of this review support the current practice of topical medication to lower IOP and clearly demonstrate a visual field protective effect. The review authors identified a total of 26 controlled trials that randomised 4979 people with OHT or open angle glaucoma to receive topical medication or a placebo, another topical medication or no treatment for at least a year. Meta-analysis of 10 trials testing different topical medications against placebo or untreated controls showed reduced incidence of glaucomatous visual field defects with treatment for people with OHT. The odds ratio (OR) was 0.62 (range 0.5 to 0.8). The class of beta-blockers (including timolol) had positive but weak evidence for a beneficial effect in protecting against visual field defects (OR 0.7, range 0.5 to 1.0). No single drug showed significant visual field protection in OHT with the evidence available. Medications included beta-blockers, dorzolamide, brimonidine, pilocarpine and epinephrine. From the reports, the majority of trials were of low methodological quality. Local and systemic side effects leading to treatment being stopped were often poorly reported and did not appear to differ between treatment groups. Drop-outs due to side effects occurred with similar frequency in people treated with beta-blocker or placebo and appeared to be less with timolol compared to brimonidine, in three trials.
This review of trials found 28 randomised controlled studies involving 2786 women. Most studies looked at the effects of tocolytic beta stimulant drugs. Results showed that babies are more likely to turn head first during ECV and to remain head first for the start of labour, if women receive beta stimulants. These drugs also reduced the number of caesarean sections, but insufficient data on possible adverse effects were collected. Little information on other types of tocolytic drugs was available, although nitric oxide donors were associated with an increase in headaches. In addition, too little evidence was available to show whether the other ways of trying to help ECV are effective. Further research is needed if we are to increase the success of ECV.
Eighteen trials randomised 3888 people to rosiglitazone therapy. The longest duration of rosiglitazone treatment was four years, most trials lasted around half a year. Unfortunately, the published studies of at least 24 weeks rosiglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide relevant evidence that patient-oriented outcomes are positively influenced by this agent. The chance of developing oedema was approximately doubled, the risk of cardiovascular diseases increased. The single large randomised controlled trial showed evidence of raised cardiovascular risk after rosiglitazone treatment. Moreover, new safety data show increased numbers of broken bones in women. This finding was published years after approval of this agent by drug regulatory authorities. New ways of exploring drug effects, for example by early long-term studies in many people, as well as public access to all safety data of published and unpublished investigations have to be established.
We included 20 studies involving 1477 participants with COPD. Rehabilitation programmes started in hospital in some trials and after discharge in others. These programmes showed great diversity in terms of exercise training (e.g. number of completed exercise sessions, type and intensity of exercise training), patient education (none to extensive self-management programmes) and how programmes were organised (within one setting, e.g. pulmonary rehabilitation, to across several settings, e.g. hospital, outpatient centre and home). Quality of life and exercise capacity were improved by rehabilitation, and the effect was substantially larger than the minimal important difference. Results for hospital readmissions and mortality were diverse, with some studies showing that pulmonary rehabilitation reduced hospital admissions and mortality compared with usual community care (no rehabilitation), and other studies not showing such effects. Uncertainty about reasons for differences across trials in terms of hospital readmissions and mortality led to downgrading of the quality of evidence (moderate-quality evidence for reduction in hospital readmissions and low-quality evidence for reduction in mortality). The quality of evidence was high for quality of life and exercise capacity. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves quality of life and exercise capacity and is a safe intervention for patients with COPD after they have experienced an exacerbation. The reasons for diverse effects on hospital readmissions and mortality, however, are not fully clear. Future studies should explore whether the extent of the rehabilitation programme and the organisation of such programmes within specific healthcare systems (e.g. within the rehabilitation setting vs embedded in the continuum of care from hospital to home to outpatient care) determines the effects of rehabilitation after COPD exacerbations.
We included randomised controlled trials in which participants in one group received paravertebral anaesthesia with or without sedation and participants in the other group received general anaesthesia during breast cancer surgery. We did not include studies in which paravertebral anaesthesia was administered in addition to general anaesthesia and then this was compared to the use of general anaesthesia. Nine studies involving 614 participants were included. Four studies were conducted in Europe, three in Asia, and one each in Africa and North America. All studies took place in medical college hospitals with no external funding.
When reviewing evidence on the quality of recovery, these studies reported various outcomes. It was found that paravertebral anaesthesia:
• may reduce 24-hour postoperative analgesic use (61 per 1000 versus 480 per 1000 in the general anaesthesia group);
• probably reduces the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (72 per 1000 versus 340 per 1000 in the general anaesthesia group);
• probably reduces pain at 2 hours (by 2.95 points on a 0 to 10 point scale) and may reduce pain at 24 hours at rest (0.21 points on a 0 to 10 point scale) compared to general anaesthesia; and
• may reduce pain on movement at 6 hours and at 24 hours post surgery (at 6 hours by 2.57 points; at 24 hours by 2.12 points on a scale of 0 to 10) compared to general anaesthesia.
No study reported on death with each anaesthetic technique. None of the included studies reported on disease-free survival, chronic pain, or quality of life after breast cancer surgery, probably because these outcomes were not envisaged or planned.
Reports of adverse events with paravertebral block were rare. Out of 290 participants who received paravertebral anaesthesia, two developed epidural spread, four had minor bleeding, and one had pleural puncture. Seventeen of 240 participants developed Horner's syndrome. All adverse events were self-limited and resolved without treatment. Most evidence was judged to be of moderate certainty, meaning that we are moderately confident in the reported result. In some cases, evidence was seen to be of low certainty, meaning that our confidence in the reported result is limited.
The evidence is current to October 2013. We included 19 randomized controlled trials (1940 participants) in this updated review. (We reran the search in February 2015 and found four studies of interest. We will deal with those studies when we next update the review.) Lidocaine was either put into the cuff (the cuff makes sure that the tube stays in place), sprayed onto the person's vocal cords, or used as a gel smeared on the end of the tube. The summarized results of the included studies showed positive results. However, the interpretation of the results should be judged carefully. Though the possible adverse effects of using lidocaine were not reported in the included studies, there are a few case reports about lidocaine toxicity, although this is very rare. For lidocaine therapy versus control, the quality of the evidence for risk of sore throat was low (according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)). This is because most of the trials did not describe how allocation was concealed and the results of the risk of sore throat were inconsistent, the quality of the evidence of the severity of sore throat , measured by the visual-analogue scale, was moderate (according to GRADE).
We performed a comprehensive literature search of the standard medical databases (from database inception to February 2019) in consultation with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Information Specialist, for all randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to a treatment group using a random method) investigating the efficiency of NSAIDs compared to the use of placebo or no treatment or compared to each other in infertile women undergoing IVF. We searched for and included studies irrespective of language and country of origin. Two review authors independently selected and evaluated studies, extracted data, and attempted to contact the authors of studies for which data were missing. We found 11 studies (2384 women); data were not available in one study, so we analysed data on 1884 patients; two studies were published as abstracts in international conference reports; and we found one ongoing trial that met our inclusion requirements. We are uncertain of an effect on ongoing pregnancy and miscarriage when NSAIDs were compared to placebo/no treatment. Results suggest that if the chance of ongoing pregnancy and miscarriage following placebo or no treatment is assumed to be 15% and 21%, respectively, the chance following the use of NSAIDs is estimated to be between 12% and 24%, and 7% and 27%, respectively. Only one study compared piroxicam with indomethacin: we are uncertain of an effect on ongoing pregnancy and on miscarriage. The evidence suggests that if the chance of ongoing pregnancy following indomethacin is assumed to be 20%, the chance following the use of piroxicam is estimated to be between 13% and 40%; while for miscarriage, the evidence suggests that if the chance following indomethacin is assumed to be 12%, the chance following the use of piroxicam is estimated to be between 5% and 27%.
Concerning the secondary outcomes, we are equally uncertain of any effect.
Currently we are uncertain of an effect of the routine use of NSAIDs as co-treatments in infertile women undergoing assisted reproduction in order to improve pregnancy rates. This is based on available data from randomised controlled trials, where no single outcome reported in the studies demonstrated a benefit with their use. The quality of the evidence was very low for all outcomes. This is because of several limitations including poorly reported study methods, imprecision, small study numbers and low numbers of events reported.
We found three randomised controlled trials (experiments where each person has an equal chance of being chosen to receive the treatment or a comparator). They compared the use of nifedipine with placebo (dummy pill) for primary dysmenorrhoea. A total of 106 women were included in the trials; however only information from two trials containing a total of 66 women was available for analysis. In one of these trials, randomisation was very unbalanced between groups: only five women received placebo whereas 19 received nifedipine. Our search for trials was done on 31 January 2019, and repeated on 5 June 2020 and 25 November 2021. One trial was identified through discussion with colleagues.
Key results
Overall we are uncertain of the effectiveness of nifedipine for relief of pain in primary dysmenorrhoea. Nifedipine may be effective for overall pain relief, and for obtaining the subsets of "good" or "excellent" pain relief. Caution is needed in drawing conclusions from this as the analysis is based on very low participant numbers. In the study where the question was asked, women who received nifedipine were more likely to prefer to continue taking the medication for future cycles than women taking the placebo (12/19 women taking nifedipine, versus 0/5 women taking placebo). In one study, participants taking nifedipine who were usually severely incapacitated by periods had a significant improvement in the ability to carry out daily activities compared to those assigned to placebo. In both trials where adverse effects were assessed there was a high, and similar, rate of adverse physical symptoms associated with menstruation both in women taking nifedipine and those taking placebo.
Quality of the evidence
We rated the quality of the evidence as very low. There was generally inadequate reporting of study methods, and one trial did not report results in a way that could be analysed. Results for analysis were drawn from only two trials, which included a total of 66 women, one of which had unbalanced randomisation.
The previous version of this review showed a reduction in opiate use during treatment that was no longer the case with the addition of new studies and the same is for the number of participants abstinent at the end of follow up. The psychosocial interventions are likely to require rigorous assessment of any changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning that may indirectly reduce drug use over longer periods of time.
Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 10 November 2017. We included research where individual patients received oral hygiene advice from a dental care professional on a one-to-one basis in a dental clinic setting with a minimum of 8 weeks follow-up.
In total, within the identified 19 studies, oral hygiene advice was provided by a hygienist in eight studies, dentist in four studies, dental nurse in one study, dentist or hygienist in one study, dental nurse and hygienist in one study, and dental nurse oral hygiene advice to the control group with further self-administration of the intervention in one study. It was unclear in three of the studies which member of the dental team carried out the intervention. Over half of the studies (10 of the 19) were conducted in a hospital setting, with only five studies conducted in a general dental practice setting (where oral hygiene advice is largely delivered). Overall we found insufficient evidence to recommend any specific method of one- to-one oral hygiene advice as being more effective than another in maintaining or improving oral health.
The studies we found varied considerably in how the oral hygiene advice was delivered, by whom and what outcomes were looked at. Due to this it was difficult to readily compare these studies and further well designed studies should be conducted to give a more accurate conclusion as to the most effective method of maintaining or improving oral health through one-to-one oral hygiene advice delivered by a dental care professional in a dental setting. We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to problems with the design of the studies.
The evidence is current to 6 December 2018. We identified 12 studies and 13 ongoing trials. Ten studies compared MSCs with a control group, and two studies compared different doses of MSCs. Five trials included only adults, whereas six trials include both adults and children and one trial was exclusively performed in children. Of the 12 completed trials, one trial was in people with inherited blood disorders (thalassaemia major), and 11 trials were in people with blood cancers. In seven trials, MSCs were given to prevent GvHD, whereas in five trials, MSCs were given to people who had already developed GvHD. MSCs were derived from umbilical cord in two trials, bone marrow in seven trials and adipose tissue in one trial; in two trials the origin of MSCs was unknown. In the comparison of MSCs with no MSCs, cells were administered at a dose of between 105 and 107 cells/kg. Seven trials gave MSCs in a single dose, whereas five trials gave multiple doses of MSCs. Trial participants were followed up for between 10 and 60 months, or in those who had already developed GvHD, up to two years. Three trials were funded and carried out by a commercial manufacturer, using their cultured mesenchymal stromal cells known as Prochymal. All trials included both men and women. MSCs may have little or no difference in the risk of death or relapse of malignant disease, in either GvHD prevention or treatment trials, as the quality of evidence was low. MSCs were well-tolerated, no infusion-related toxicity or ectopic tissue formation was reported. No study reported health-related quality-of-life. In trials where MSCs were administered to prevent GvHD, MSCs may reduce the risk of developing chronic GvHD, but may make little or no difference to the risk of developing acute GvHD. In GvHD treatment trials, we are very uncertain whether MSCs improve complete response of either acute or chronic GvHD as the quality of evidence is very low. We found no differences in outcomes between participants who received a higher dose of MSCs when compared with those who received a lower dose of MSCs. The quality of evidence is low or very low for all outcome measures, due to the small number of trials and low number of study participants included in this review. One trial started in 2008, but its results are unknown as it is not yet published. It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions or provide recommendations on the use of MSCs, either to prevent or treat GvHD. More trials with large numbers of study participants are needed to improve the quality of evidence.
We searched for observational studies (studies where no intervention takes place but people are observed over prolonged periods of time) that investigated how many people with prediabetes at the beginning of the study developed type 2 diabetes. We also evaluated studies comparing people with prediabetes to people with normoglycaemia. Prediabetes was defined by different blood glucose measurements.
We found 103 studies, monitoring people over 1 to 24 years. More than 250,000 participants began the studies. In 41 studies the participants were of Australian, European or North American origin, in 7 studies participants were primarily of Latin American origin and in 50 studies participants were of Asian or Middle Eastern origin. Three studies had American Indians as participants, and one study each invited people from Mauritius and Nauru. Six studies included children, adolescents or both as participants.
This evidence is up to date as of 26 February 2018. Generally, the development of new type 2 diabetes (diabetes incidence) in people with prediabetes increased over time. However, many participants also reverted from prediabetes back to normal blood glucose levels. Compared to people with normoglycaemia, those with prediabetes (any definition) showed an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but results showed wide differences and depended on how prediabetes was measured. There were no clear differences with regard to several regions in the world or different populations. Because people with prediabetes may develop diabetes but may also change back to normoglycaemia almost any time, doctors should be careful about treating prediabetes because we are not sure whether this will result in more benefit than harm, especially when done on a global scale affecting many people worldwide. The certainty of the evidence for overall prognosis was moderate because results varied widely. The certainty of evidence for studies comparing prediabetic with normoglycaemic people was low because the results were not precise and varied widely. In our included observational studies the researchers often did not investigate well enough whether factors like physical inactivity, age or increased body weight also influenced the development of type 2 diabetes, thus making the relationship between prediabetes and the development of type 2 diabetes less clear.
Our confidence in the evidence for the interventions studied ranged from moderate to very low, implying that the results of further research could differ from the results of this review. The main reasons for our reduced confidence in the evidence are that in some of the studies people were not randomly placed into different intervention groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the interventions. For some interventions, the results were very inconsistent across the different studies and for some only one study was available, or the intervention had few people studied. The review authors searched for studies that were published up to July 2022.
We carried out a comprehensive search for studies. The evidence is current to December 2014. No randomised controlled trials were found that evaluated the effectiveness of sleep positioning systems to reduce or prevent hip migration.
Two small randomised controlled trials compared children's quality of sleep when they were using and not using their sleep positioning system. One of these studies also examined pain when sleeping in and out of a sleep positioning system. These were cross-over trials (see Cochrane Glossary). The children in these studies spent a few nights using their sleep positioning system and then a few nights not using it, or the other way round. The order in which they either used or did not use the equipment was randomised.
Twenty-one children with cerebral palsy, aged between 5 and 16 years, who were used to sleeping in sleep positioning systems took part in the studies. One of the studies took place in a sleep laboratory and the other study took place in the children's homes. Neither study reported any differences in quality of sleep or pain whether using or not using their sleep positioning system. These results need to be interpreted cautiously due to the small numbers of children involved and the fact that the children who participated were already accustomed users of the equipment. There were also various weaknesses in the way the research was designed and reported. The quality of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of sleep positioning systems for children with cerebral palsy is very low and more robust research is needed to help families and professionals make informed decisions about whether to use this intervention.
The evidence is current to January 2019. We included nine studies (randomised controlled trials, that is studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) of 2955 infertile couples undergoing IVF or ICSI. There were three different study designs: (1) TLS with conventional assessment of still TLS images versus conventional incubation and assessment; (2) TLS utilising embryo selection software versus TLS with conventional assessment of still TLS images; and (3) TLS utilising embryo selection software versus conventional incubation and assessment. TLS with conventional assessment of still TLS images versus conventional incubation and assessment
All the evidence for this comparison was low-quality. It is unclear whether there is any difference between the interventions in rates of livebirth or ongoing pregnancy or miscarriage. The evidence suggests that if the rate of livebirth or ongoing pregnancy associated with conventional incubation and assessment is 35%, the rate with use of TLS with conventional morphological assessment of still TLS images would be between 27% and 40%, and if the miscarriage rate with conventional incubation is 4%, the rate associated with conventional morphological assessment of still TLS images would be between 4% and 14%. It is unclear whether there is a difference between interventions in rates of stillbirth or clinical pregnancy.
TLS utilising embryo selection software versus TLS with conventional assessment of still TLS images
All findings for this comparison were very uncertain due to very low-quality evidence. No data were available on livebirth, but one study reported ongoing pregnancy. It is unclear whether there is any difference between interventions in rates of ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage, or clinical pregnancy. The evidence suggests that if the rate of ongoing pregnancy associated with TLS with conventional morphological assessment of still TLS images is 47%, the rate associated with TLS utilising embryo selection software would be between 22% and 52%, and if the miscarriage rate associated with conventional morphological assessment of still TLS images is 5%, the rate associated with TLS utilising embryo selection software would be between 4% and 15%. No studies reported stillbirth.
TLS utilising embryo selection software versus conventional incubation and assessment
All findings for this comparison were very uncertain due to the very low-quality of the evidence. It is unclear whether there is any difference between interventions with respect to rates of livebirth or clinical pregnancy. The evidence suggests lower rates of miscarriage in the TLS group for the outcome of miscarriage. The evidence suggests that if the livebirth rate associated with conventional incubation is 48%, the rate with the use of TLS would be between 46% and 55%, and if the miscarriage rate with conventional incubation is 11%, the rate associated with TLS would be between 5% and 10%. There is no good evidence showing that TLS is more or less effective than conventional methods of embryo incubation. Patients may wish to take part in randomised controlled trials on TLS in order to add to the existing evidence base and to help guide assisted reproductive technology patients in the future. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to low. The main limitations were high risk of bias in the included studies, imprecision, indirectness, and inconsistency.
We wanted to find out which permanent and temporary changes to the environment of immature mosquitoes reduce malaria in people (clinical outcomes), and the quantity of immature and adult mosquitoes (entomological outcomes). We searched for studies that looked at permanent and temporary changes to the environment of immature mosquitoes compared to no intervention or a different permanent or temporary change. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods. The review included 16 studies that used a range of different randomized and non-randomized study designs. Eleven studies were conducted in Africa and five in Asia. Only a few studies reported clinical outcomes, with most focussing on the number of immature mosquitoes, or adult mosquitoes, or both (entomological outcomes). We found there was some evidence to support the use of permanent (modification) and temporary (manipulation) changes to the water environments to reduce the number of immature mosquitoes in specific settings. However, when looking at clinical outcomes, 1. the effect of habitat manipulation on malaria parasite prevalence and clinical malaria incidence was unclear; 2. malaria parasite prevalence may be reduced when using habitat manipulation with larviciding; 3. combining manipulation and modification with larviciding probably makes little or no difference to malaria parasite prevalence and haemoglobin levels. The review included a wide range of different changes to the water environment of immature mosquitoes, with some combining them with water treatments (larviciding), which meant that very few studies looked at the same intervention. Many of the included studies had issues regarding how well they were conducted. This review updates a 2013 Cochrane Review. The evidence is up to date to 30 November 2021.
We identified 16 randomised clinical trials (trials where participants are randomly allocated to treatment groups) including 827 participants. The included people had cirrhosis often due to alcoholic liver disease or viral hepatitis (liver infection due to a virus). The trials compared BCAA with placebo (a pretend treatment), no intervention, diets, lactulose (a liquid sugar often used to treat constipation), or neomycin (an antibiotic). The evidence is current to October 2014. The analyses found no effect on mortality, but that BCAA had a beneficial effect on symptoms and signs of hepatic encephalopathy. BCAA did not increase the risk of serious adverse events, but was associated with nausea and diarrhoea. When excluding trials on lactulose or neomycin, BCAA had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy. When analysing trials with a lactulose or neomycin control, we found no beneficial or detrimental effect of BCAA. We assessed the quality of the evidence to evaluate aspects that can lead to errors in the judgment of intervention effects. We concluded that we had high quality evidence in our analyses about the effect of BCAA on hepatic encephalopathy. We concluded that we had moderate or low quality evidence in the remaining analyses because the number of participants in the trials was too small and the risk of bias (systematic errors) was unclear or high.
We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing topical NSAIDs with placebo (creams or gels that do not contain a medicine) or other medicines in adults aged 16 years or older with musculoskeletal pain (typically sports injuries). The evidence is current to February 2015.
This review is an update of 'Topical NSAIDs for acute pain in adults' originally published in Issue 6, 2010. We identified 14 new studies to add to the 47 studies included in the earlier review. We also identified 14 studies in a clinical trial registry that are completed and three short reports from meetings, for which we could not find full details (about 4500 participants). Three more studies are ongoing (almost 900 participants).
The 61 included studies, involving 8386 participants, were generally of high-quality. They tested a number of different topical drugs, mostly against a topical placebo (carrier without the NSAID), with application at least once a day. We were interested in participants having good pain reduction (by about half) around seven days after treatment started. At later times, most people are expected to get better even without treatment.
We looked at particular formulations of individual drugs. Gel formulations of diclofenac and ketoprofen were among the most effective, along with ibuprofen gel and diclofenac plaster. For diclofenac and ketoprofen gels, 7 or 8 people out of 10 with a painful strain, sprain, or muscle pull had much reduced pain after seven days, compared with only 2 or 3 out of 10 with placebo (high quality data). Other NSAIDs and formulations were better than placebo, but not by as much. Because both topical NSAIDs and topical placebo are rubbed into the skin in these studies, we know that any effect is not just from rubbing.
About 1 in 20 people experienced a mild and short-lived side effect like redness at the application site. This was the same for topical NSAID and topical placebo (high quality data). Side effects like a stomach upset or feeling sick were uncommon, with no difference between topical NSAID and topical placebo (high quality data). There were no serious side effects.
We wanted to know whether commercially developed, alternative laboratory-based molecular tests are accurate enough to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR. We looked for studies investigating these tests in people (or samples) that were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using RT-PCR which modified RT-PCR by removing or altering components of this testing process. We included 105 evaluations evaluating alternatives to RT-PCR in the review. The main results are based on 74,753 samples, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 7517 of these samples. Most evaluations (27/105) concerned various test types specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations concerned various test types operating at one temperature (isothermal tests) rather than cycling through different temperatures. Twenty-four of 105 evaluations were concerned with various test types that combined these two alternative approaches. Only tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays with RNA extraction (a type of isothermal test) met WHO-acceptable standards for confirming and ruling out SARS-CoV-2. For illustration, the results of these studies indicate that in a group of 1000 people, 50 of whom (5%) actually have SARS-CoV-2:
* For tests specifically designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification:
-51 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, three people (6%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result).
-949 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, two people (0.2%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result)
*For TMA tests with RNA extraction:
-55 people would test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, six people (10%) would not have SARS-CoV-2 (false-positive result).
-945 people would test negative for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, one person (0.1%) would actually have SARS-CoV-2 (false-negative result) Most included studies did not provide information on participants who underwent testing, such as whether they had symptoms or were close contacts of a SARS-CoV-2 case. We also had concerns about the method of recruiting participants for the majority of included studies, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the accuracy of these methods. In addition, the method used to determine whether individuals did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered reliable for most studies, which may have resulted in underestimating the accuracy of these methods. Some studies did not follow the manufacturers' instructions for using the test. Results from different test brands using the same technique varied. The studies included in this review suggest that two laboratory-based molecular tests might be accurate enough to replace or supplement RT-PCR tests with prior RNA extraction/purification for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: RT-PCR tests developed to omit or adapt RNA extraction or puriﬁcation and TMA isothermal tests (retaining an RNA extraction step). Other alternative tests to RT-PCR were assessed just by a few studies of limited methodological quality, and their performance should be evaluated by additional studies. Furthermore, data in these studies mostly relied on samples acquired in the past (compared to current or future samples), thus further evaluation of these tests in real clinical practice scenarios is required. Also, decisions on the optimal test for a specific setting will be driven not only by diagnostic accuracy, but also by other factors such as test complexity, time to result, acceptability to those being tested, and the setting in which the tests are to be used. This review includes evidence published up to 31 October 2022.
The evidence is current to December 2016. We found 63 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants undergoing open chest, heart, breast, abdominal, vascular, gynaecological and other surgery, but not orthopaedic surgery. RCTs are studies where people are allocated by chance to one or the other of different treatments being studied. The studies included only adults, and were mostly conducted in Europe and North America, with some from China, Egypt and Brazil. The types of surgery included surgery with a high event rate of persistent pain after surgery, such as breast surgery, limb amputation and opening the chest, and surgery with a lower risk but high numbers of procedures, such as caesarean section.
We were able to pool results from 39 RCTs enrolling a total of 3027 participants for our inclusive analysis. Follow-up was for 1293 participants at three months, 1365 participants at six months, 326 participants at 12 months, and 43 participants at 20 or more months after surgery. The RCTs did not report surgical and anaesthetic complications consistently and little information was available on these. The studies were mostly funded by the institutions conducting the studies. Regional anaesthesia reduced the number of people who experienced persistent pain after undergoing non-orthopaedic surgery. For open chest surgery, giving an epidural halved the odds of a person having persistent postoperative pain at three to 18 months after surgery (7 RCTs, 499 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Seven people needed to be treated in this way for one to benefit.
For the prevention of persistent pain three to 12 months after breast cancer surgery, seven people needed regional anaesthesia for one to benefit (18 RCTs, 1297 participants, low-quality evidence). Infusion of local anaesthetic into a vein was shown to reduce the risk of persistent pain three to six months after breast surgery (2 RCTs, 97 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with three people needing to be treated for one to benefit. Regional anaesthesia reduced the odds by more than half of a woman experiencing persistent pain after caesarean section (4 RCTs, 551 participants, moderate-quality evidence). The number of women treated for one to benefit was 19.
Continuous local anaesthetic infusion of the site where bone tissue was obtained from the hip bone did not clearly reduce the number of people with persistent pain at three to 55 months (3 RCTs, 123 participants, low-quality evidence).
We could not synthesize evidence for limb amputation, hernia repair, cardiac or abdominal surgery because of differences in how treatment was given or how results were reported. We found consistent evidence supporting the use of regional anaesthesia in adults to prevent persistent pain after a number of types of surgery. However, we observed variations in the effect sizes, and at different times after surgery. Some studies could not be blinded to the treatment received and our results are affected by the small number of studies and participants, and the loss to follow-up of participants over time. The evidence was therefore of low or moderate quality.
We included 19 RCTs involving 13,209 women of childbearing age. The trials compared:
- tubal rings versus clips (six RCTs, 4232 women);
- partial salpingectomy versus electrocoagulation (three RCTs, 2019 women);
- tubal rings versus electrocoagulation (two RCTs, 599 women);
- partial salpingectomy versus clips (four RCTs, 3827 women);
- clips versus electrocoagulation (two RCTs, 206 women); and
- two types of clips, i.e. Hulka clips versus Filshie clips (two RCTs, 2326 women).
We found no RCTs that investigated sterilisation by chemicals or tubal inserts, so all the included studies involved an abdominal operation.
There were no deaths reported with any method, and major and minor morbidity were rare. Pregnancy rates were less than 5/1000 procedures one year after surgery. Complicationrates (problems after surgery/minor morbidity) were very low for all methods compared. Minor complications, including pain, and technical failures were more common with rings than clips. Major morbidity and postoperative pain were more common with partial salpingectomy than with electrocoagulation. Postoperative pain was reported twice as often by women sterilised by tubal rings than those sterilised by electrocoagulation.Technical failures were more common with clips than cutting and tying techniques, but operating time was shorter for clips.
We found little evidence concerning women's or surgeon's satisfaction. Tubal sterilisation by cutting and tying the tubes, or using electric current, clips or rings, is an effective method of contraception with few problems. The choice of method will depend upon the surgeon's experience, availability of equipment, setting, and cost. More research is needed about methods for tubal sterilisation that do not require an abdominal operation.
There was not enough evidence from trials to determine whether, and if so when, moderately displaced fractures should be manipulated back into position. Nor was there enough evidence to determine the best method and duration of immobilisation.
We wanted to establish if ovarian hormone stimulation tailored to individual women based on certain characteristics was better than standard doses for:
- helping women have a live birth;
- avoiding OHSS;
- helping women achieve a pregnancy. We searched for studies that compared individualised ovarian stimulation dosing to standard dosing or to another type of individualised dosing. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 26 studies involving 8520 women. We grouped these into two comparisons:
- direct dose comparison studies recruited women predicted to respond to IVF stimulation either poorly, normally, or excessively, based on their ovarian reserve test. Women were then randomly assigned to different doses of ovarian-stimulating hormones to see whether the different doses would affect IVF outcomes.
- ORT-based dose selection studies divided women into those whose stimulation dose was based on the women's ORT and those receiving a standard dose or one based on another characteristic. For women predicted to respond poorly or normally to stimulation based on their ovarian reserve test, it was unclear whether increasing the dose of stimulation medication influenced the chance of getting pregnant, having a baby, or the chance of OHSS. However, the included studies were small and compared different doses of medication. For women predicted to respond poorly, if the chance of having a live birth after taking 150 international units (IU) of hormone is 16%, the chance with 300 or 450 IU would be between 13% to 26%. For women predicted to have a normal response, if the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy with 150 IU is 29%, the chance with 200/225 IU would be between 22% to 36%.
For women predicted to have an excessive response to stimulation, reducing the stimulation dose may or may not affect the chance of having a baby. If the chance of live birth with 100 IU is 25%, the chance with 150 IU would be between 18% to 33%. Reducing the dose may reduce the rate of OHSS. If the chance of moderate or severe OHSS with a lower dose is 1.6%, the chance with a higher dose would be between 1.3% and 9.6%, but this is also unclear. There was no notable reduction in ongoing pregnancy or live birth when using ORTs to select a dose, but it is unclear whether there is a benefit. Different methods of using ORT to select the dose might be more or less effective compared to others. If the chance of an ongoing pregnancy or live birth with a standard starting dose were 25%, the chance with dosing based on an ORT would be between 25% and 31%. Individualised dosing did appear to reduce the chance of having OHSS when compared to giving all women the same dose of stimulation medication, but we have little confidence in this evidence. If the chance of moderate or severe OHSS with a standard starting dose were 5%, the chance with dosing based on an ovarian reserve test would be between 2% and 5%. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low to low, due to limitations in study design (researchers and participants often knew which treatment was assigned) and statistical imprecision, as the studies included too few women to provide clear results for the most important outcomes, such as having a baby. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to February 2023.
Our review of seven randomised trials, involving 1396 women, found that intravenous or intramuscular magnesium sulphate was substantially better than intravenous diazepam in reducing the risk of maternal death and of having further seizures. Treatment was for 24 hours unless there was an indication to continue for longer. Diazepam infusion was titrated against the level of sedation, with the aim of keeping the woman drowsy but rousable.  Use of magnesium sulphate requires monitoring of respiration rate, tendon reflexes and urine output to avoid adverse effects.
Fewer babies had low Apgar scores at birth with magnesium sulphate than with diazepam and, although admissions to a special care nursery were similar, fewer babies in the magnesium sulphate group had a length of stay of more than seven days.
In other Cochrane reviews, magnesium sulphate was also substantially better than other drugs (phenytoin and lytic cocktail).
The review identified 10 randomised controlled trials involving 4052 women. Seven of these trials looked at a drug called misoprostol, which is a prostaglandin and so works by increasing muscle contractions. Overall, the trials suggest that misoprostol does not work as well as oxytocin infusion, and it has more side effects. However, oxytocin needs to be kept in a refrigerator, and so in settings where refrigeration and infusions are not readily available, misoprostol can be used.
Other clinical trials looked into using other types of drugs or squeezing the main artery that supplies blood to the woman. The number of women included in these studies was too small for any useful conclusions regarding their effectiveness and safety.
Only a single multi-centre study could be included in this review. Evidence is current to January 2014. This study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. This study of 272 children in five Australian hospitals reported that those randomly assigned to earlier treatment according to a clinical pathway showed improved clinical outcomes (cough resolved earlier and quality of life was better) compared with those who were randomly assigned to later use of the pathway. No adverse events were reported. The quality of evidence was graded as moderate. Evidence is limited, as only one study could be included in this review. This study was unable to completely blind participants to the clinical pathway.
We identified 12 studies which were suitable for use in the review. However, each study had some problems in the way that it was carried out. These problems make it difficult to be certain about the usefulness of MDRPs. Overall, the reviewed articles suggest that MDRPs are more likely to help patients cope with their physical needs than their emotional needs. MDRPs which looked at one specific behaviour area, such as diet, physical activity or stress, appeared to be more helpful for patients than programmes which attempted to address several different behaviours. Successful MDRPs usually involved face-to-face contact between a patient and a health professional (usually a nurse or physical therapist) and included at least one follow-up phone call. Programmes which took place over longer time periods (more than six months), or which were delivered by a specific type of health professional, or were delivered to a single cancer site were not more successful than brief, focused MDRPs delivered to mixed groups of cancer patients.
Antiplatelet agents probably prevent heart attacks, but do not clearly reduce death or stroke. Treatment with these agents may increase the risk of major and minor bleeding. Clotting of dialysis access was prevented with antiplatelet agents. The benefits of antiplatelet agents for people with CKD is probably limited to the prevention of a heart attack. The treatment does not appear to prevent stroke or death and probably incurs excess serious bleeding that may require hospital admission or transfusion.
This review aims to evaluate evidence on the use of statins at the time of heart surgery to investigate if use can help to prevent kidney failure and how well statins are tolerated among patients. We searched the literature to January 2015 and included seven studies that involved a total of 662 participants to inform our assessment. In these studies, patients planned for heart surgery received statins or placebo (or no treatment at all). Five studies (467 participants) reported rates of kidney failure. We found that there was a high risk of bias in six of the seven included studies.
We found no difference in the rate of kidney failure between patients who received statins and those who did not. Two studies (195 patients) reported serum creatinine (a marker of kidney function) after the operation. We found that serum creatinine was lower in patients in the statin group (indicating better kidney function). Other conclusions were limited by the small number of studies. However, patients who received statins did not seem to need less dialysis. They did not have a higher rate of death in hospital and did not have an increased rate of adverse events.
We included two randomized studies, in six published reports, with 431 participants with locally advanced esophageal cancer. We searched biomedical databases, clinical trial registries, conference proceedings, and reference lists up to 7 February 2017 for studies. The quality of evidence ranged from very low to high, depending on the outcome being assessed, because the trials were small and at unclear or high risk of bias (a systematic error or deviation from the truth that affects the results, favouring one treatment over another). We found evidence that adding surgery reduced the risk of the cancer recurring at the primary site, but did not improve overall survival. Moreover, there were more treatment-related deaths in the group of participants who underwent surgery.
The evidence is current to May 2014. We found 27 trials (with a total of 2485 participants) examining whether exercise can help reduce neck pain and disability; improve function, global perceived effect, patient satisfaction and/or quality of life. In these trials, exercise was compared to either a placebo treatment, or no treatment (waiting list), or exercise combined with another intervention was compared with that same intervention (which could include manipulation, education/advice, acupuncture, massage, heat or medications). Twenty-four of 27 trials evaluating neck pain reported on the duration of the disorder: 1 acute; 1 acute to chronic; 1 subacute; 4 subacute/chronic; and 16 chronic. One study reported on neck disorder with acute radiculopathy; two trials investigated subacute to chronic cervicogenic headache. Results showed that exercise is safe, with temporary and benign side effects, although more than half of the trials did not report on adverse effects. An exercise classification system was used to ensure similarity between protocols when looking at the effects of different types of exercises. Some types of exercise did show an advantage over the other comparison groups. There appears to be a role for strengthening exercises in the treatment of chronic neck pain, cervicogenic headache and cervical radiculopathy if these exercises are focused on the neck, shoulder and shoulder blade region. Furthermore, the use of strengthening exercises, combined with endurance or stretching exercises has also been shown to be beneficial. There is some evidence to suggest the beneficial effects of specific exercises (e.g. sustained natural apophyseal glides) with cervicogenic headaches and mindfulness exercises (e.g. Qigong) for chronic mechanical neck pain. There appears to be minimal effect on neck pain and function when only stretching or endurance type exercises are used for the neck, shoulder and shoulder blade region. No high quality evidence was found, indicating that there is still uncertainty about the effectiveness of exercise for neck pain. Future research is likely to have an important impact on the effect estimate.There were a number of challenges with this review; for example, the number of participants in most trials was small, more than half of the included studies were either of low or very low quality and there was limited evidence on optimum dosage requirements.
The review of six trials involving 374 people found that a short course of corticosteroids after discharge reduces the chances of a relapse, and lessens the need for using reliever inhalers without major adverse effects. The benefit lasts for about three weeks.
The findings of this review are based on five randomised clinical trials with 290 patients. Phyllanthus was tested versus antiviral drugs, including lamivudine, interferon alpha, thymosin, or thymosin alpha 1 for three months to 12 months. The primary findings of this review are that phyllanthus seemed to have a superior effect on clearance of serum HBeAg at the end of treatment in conventional meta-analysis, but not when trial sequential analysis was applied. Phyllanthus had no significant effect on clearance of serum HBsAg, serum HBV DNA, or HBeAg seroconversion when compared with antiviral drugs. No data were identified on mortality or morbidity, adverse events, quality of life, or liver histology. However, the findings in our review are inconclusive due to the small numbers of patients and outcomes, risk of bias, and the study design. We need more randomised trials to confirm or reject the potential effects of phyllanthus . We advocate that phyllanthus is primarily assessed against placebo. This can be done in randomised clinical trials in which all patients receive antiviral drugs that are known to offer more benefit than harm and the patients are then randomised to phyllanthus versus placebo. If the effect of phyllanthus versus placebo is unequivocally demonstrated in such trials, it may be prudent to assess the effects of phyllanthus versus other antiviral drugs superior to placebo in such trials. The quality of trials regarding conduct and report should also be taken into account.
Two small studies and one large study were identified. The two small studies enrolled infants given caffeine as a preventative measure. Neither study demonstrated any decrease in apnoea or other short term complications.
The one large study included a heterogeneous group of infants who received therapy for a variety of indications (prevention, treatment and avoidance of post-extubation apnoea of prematurity). In this overall population there was an improvement in clinical outcome at hospital discharge and developmental outcome at 18 to 21 months; however, these benefits could not be proven in the subpopulation who received prophylactic caffeine. A decrease in PDA was noted in this subpopulation.
The review looked to see if using CTG during pregnancy might improve outcomes for babies by identifying those with complications. It looked for studies that included women at both increased risk, and at low risk, of complications. The review included six studies with all of the women at increased risk of complications. Four of the studies were undertaken in the 1980s and two in the late 1990s. The included studies were not of high quality. There were no differences in outcomes identified (low/very low quality evidence), although when computerised interpretation of the CTG trace was used, the findings looked promising. However, CTG monitors, associated technologies and the way midwives and obstetricians care for women with different complications in pregnancy have changed over the years. This means that more studies are needed now to see if outcomes for babies at increased risk of complications can be improved with antenatal CTG, particularly computerised CTG.
Studies in animals have shown that lowering the body temperature can help to protect the brain cells in circumstances when the blood supply to the cells is compromised. Similarly, studies in humans who have been resuscitated after their heart stopped beating have shown that lowering their body temperature helps to reduce brain damage. The purpose of this updated version of a previous review of the same title was to determine whether cooling patients who were having brain surgery reduced death and serious disability, or was associated with increased risk of harm. A detailed search of the available literature up until May 2014 identified four eligible studies that included a total of 1219 participants. Their results were combined to answer these questions. No evidence was found that cooling patients who are having brain operations reduced the risk of death or severe disability, or produced significant harm.
Its use in newborn babies is studied in only one study of 63 babies. Propofol helped to reduce time to complete procedure, time of recovery and time to prepare drugs. However, with this small number of newborns studied, the safety can not be proven. Further studies are warranted.
We searched the medical literature for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of intravenous heparin in rAAA repairs (current until December 2015). We found no RCTs or CCTs of intravenous heparin in rAAA repairs that satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found no RCTs or CCTs of intravenous heparin in rAAA repairs (including parallel designs). Therefore, we were unable to assess the effect of intravenous heparin on all-cause mortality and incidence of general arterial disease, for example, cardiovascular, cerebral, pulmonary and renal pathologies in ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) management in people undergoing an emergency repair. It is clear that an RCT is needed to address this question in rAAA management as there is no high quality evidence.
The review included 56 trials with a total of 4826 participants. The results suggest that exercise may improve overall quality of life right after the exercise program is completed. Exercise may also improve the person's physical ability and the way the person can function in society. Exercise also reduced tiredness at different times during and after the exercise program. The positive effects of exercise were greater when the exercise was more intense. No effects of exercise was found in the way a person views his or her body, on the person's ability to think clearly, the person's mood, feeling of pain, and on the way the person views his or her spiritual health.
However, these findings need to be viewed with caution because this review looked at many different types of exercise programs, which varied by type of setting, length of the program, and how hard the trial participants had to exercise. Also, the investigators used a number of different ways to measure quality of life.
There is a need for more research to understand how to maintain the positive effects of exercise over a longer period of time after the exercise program is completed, and to determine which parts of the exercise program are necessary (i.e. when to start the program, type of exercise, length of the program or exercise session, how hard to exercise). It is also important to find out if one type of exercise is better for a specific cancer type than another for the maximum effect on quality of life.
We wanted to know whether galantamine is effective and helpful in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, in terms of memory, ability to carry out self-care, and behaviour. We also wanted to find out if galantamine causes any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared galantamine given by mouth to placebo (which does not contain any active ingredients but is given in the same way as the active medication) in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. We chose studies in which people were assigned randomly (like a flip of a coin) to receive galantamine or placebo for at least 4 weeks. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 21 studies that involved 10,990 people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. Their average age was 74 years. Treatment durations ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. Most studies included people with dementia due to mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease; one study involved people with severe Alzheimer's disease. Three studies included people with mild cognitive impairment. Pharmaceutical companies (Janssen / Johnson & Johnson) sponsored 16 of the 21 included studies.
After 6 months of treatment, participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who received galantamine had better memory, ability to do self-care activities, and behaviour than those who received placebo. Importantly, the memory improvements we observed were considered clinically meaningful according to standards set by experts. This same group of participants probably had better overall improvement than those who received placebo.
In people with mild cognitive impairment, galantamine, compared to placebo, may make little to no difference in improving memory or the ability to do self-care activities. However, participants who received galantamine probably had a lower risk of progression to dementia after 2 years of treatment.
Compared to those taking placebo, people on galantamine were three times more likely to experience gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). The number of deaths was low, and there was no evidence that galantamine caused more deaths than placebo. Many people in the studies (ranging from 17% to 40%) stopped taking their assigned medication early, more so in the galantamine groups than the placebo groups. This is a limitation which may favour galantamine. This review updates our previous review from 2006. The evidence is current to December 2022.
Therefore, we conducted a systematic review assessing the influence of CSFs on disease and infection-related outcomes. Our review showed that the addition of CSFs to chemotherapy in AML patients affected neither overall survival, nor the achievement of disease remission or the rate of relapse. Importantly, they did not affect the rate of infections in this population. We concluded that CSFs post-chemotherapy should not be given routinely in AML patients. However, their administration could be considered on an individual basis.
We found three relevant studies, all of which were carried out in specific hospital settings. Two papers only included patients with acute stroke, and the other included those who had sustained a hip fracture. The papers differed in many other ways, so we we were unable to estimate a summary of their combined results. In general, a 'positive' IQCODE picked up patients who would go on to develop dementia (good sensitivity), but mislabelled a number who did not develop dementia (poor specificity). We cannot make recommendations for current practice, based on the studies we reviewed. The included studies demonstrated some of the challenges of research that follows people at risk of dementia over time. Not all the studies had a robust method of ensuring that none of the included participants had dementia at the start of the study, and that only new cases were identified. Similarly, many of the participants included at the start of the study were not available for re-assessment, due to death or other illness.
The review was performed by a team based in research centres in the UK (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Oxford). We had no external funding specific to this study, and we have no conflicts of interest that may have influenced our assessment of the research data.
The evidence in this review includes research published up to 27 April 2020. We found only one report of a study that took place at three hospitals in the UK. It was a feasibility study: it looked at whether it would be possible to conduct larger and more conclusive randomised studies. A summary of the study data was published and presented at a conference. The study report was not good enough to judge the quality of the study. No information about funding was given.
We did not find any other studies that could be included in this review, and there are no ongoing randomised studies. The study randomised 22 children with portal hypertension and enlarged veins into two groups:
- one group had an elastic ring placed around the enlarged vein (12 children); and
- one group had no active treatment (10 children).
There was no information about the diagnosis, or age, of any of the children. The children were followed for at least six months. Two children were lost to follow-up by one year. Only 10 children in total completed the trial study at two-year follow-up.
In the group who had an elastic ring placed:
- one child died;
- no children had any other serious unwanted effects;
- one child needed a liver transplant; and 
- one child had oesophageal bleeding.
In the group who received no active treatment:
- no children died; 
- one child had a serious unwanted effect: an immune disorder in which blood does not clot properly (idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura); 
- no children needed a liver transplant; and
- three children had oesophageal bleeding.
No unwanted effects that were less serious were reported in either group. The study did not report any information about the children's well-being (quality of life). The insufficient and poor reporting of results from one small, randomised study, and the lack of other randomised studies, mean that we cannot draw trustworthy conclusions. We do not know how well elastic rings work to prevent bleeding from enlarged veins in the oesophagus in children and young people, or about any unwanted effects they might cause.
Until good-quality randomised studies take place and measure the numbers of deaths, quality of life, failure to control bleeding, and unwanted effects, we will not know if elastic rings are a good treatment to prevent bleeding in children and young people with long-lasting liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.
Ten different herbal medicines were tested in ten randomised trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The present systematic review found no significant antiviral effect of the herbal medicines when compared with placebo, but the data suggest that some herbal medicines in combination with interferon may have effects on the clearance of HCV RNA and on normalisation of liver enzymes. However, there is no strong evidence for any efficacy of these medicinal herbs for chronic hepatitis C due to the fact that most positive effects came from clinical trials with low methodological quality. Medicinal herbs for hepatitis C virus infection should not be used outside well-designed, randomised clinical trials.
The non-reporting of a piece of research and the selective reporting of only some of its findings has been identified as a problem for research studies such as randomised trials and systematic reviews of these. If the decision about what to report and what to keep unpublished is based on the results obtained in the trial, this will lead to bias and potentially misleading conclusions by users of the research. One way to see if there might be discrepancies between what was planned or done in a trial and what is eventually reported is to compare the protocol or entry in a trial registry for the trial with the content of its published report. This might reveal that changes were made between the registration and planning of the trial and its eventual analysis. Any such changes should be described in the published report, to reassure readers and others who will use the trial's results that the risk of bias has been kept low.
This Cochrane methodology review examines the reporting of randomised trials by reviewing research done by others in which the information in protocols or trial registry entries were compared to that in the published reports for groups of trials, to see if this detected any inconsistencies for any aspects of the trials. We included 16 studies in this review and the results indicate that there are often discrepancies between the information provided in protocol and trial registry entries and that contained in the published reports for randomised trials. These discrepancies cover many aspects of the trials and are not explained or stated in the published reports.
One trial with longer follow up (more than 10 years) showed improved survival with adjuvant radiotherapy but this improvement did not exist at 5 years follow up. Radiotherapy reduced the number of men whose cancer spread to other parts of the body (metastases). We found that radiotherapy improved local control in the prostate bed and did reduce the risk of cancer recurring. Radiotherapy reduced the number of men with an abnormal PSA blood test, but the importance of this is uncertain. Radiotherapy does increase the risk of side effects, (mostly mild) affecting bladder and bowel function.
It is not clear from these studies whether it is better to give radiotherapy immediately after surgery when these high risk features are present, or whether it would be just as good watching for a time, and only giving radiotherapy once the PSA blood test starts to rise. This is the subject of ongoing studies. Radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy should be considered if high risk features are present, but the optimal timing is unclear.
We searched for evidence on 30th November 2016 and identified five trials with a total of 1159 pregnant women. All five trials used X-ray pelvimetry in comparison to no X-ray pelvimetry.
The women who received X-ray pelvimetry were more likely to have a caesarean section (low-quality evidence ). Whether a woman had pelvimetry or not, we found no difference in the numbers of babies that died (very low-quality evidence ), who did not have enough oxygen during labour, or were admitted to special care baby units (very low-quality evidence ). For the women, no differences were found between numbers of women with wound sepsis, those who received a blood transfusion, or those whose caesarean section scar began to break down (all very low-quality evidence). Apgar score less than seven at five minutes was not reported in any study. There is too little evidence (the majority of which is low quality) to show whether measuring the size of the woman's pelvis (pelvimetry) is beneficial and safe when the baby is in a head-down position. The number of women having a caesarean section increased if women had X-ray pelvimetry but there was insufficient good-quality evidence to show if pelvimetry improves outcomes for the baby. More research is needed.
Two authors independently identified trials and independently extracted data. We performed all the analysis based on intention-to-treat analysis. One trial randomised 60 patients to three dimensional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 30) compared with standard two dimensional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 30). The report on the trial design revealed high risk of systematic error ('bias'). There were no post-operative complications or conversion to open cholecystectomy in either group. There was no difference in the operating time or number of surgical errors between the two groups. Currently, there is no evidence that three dimensional image is superior to two dimensional image in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further randomised clinical trials with low risk of systematic errors and random errors are necessary to assess the new systems of three dimensional imaging in comparison with two dimensional imaging.
The review of trials compared different ways of giving penicillin. Penicillin seemed to work better as injections than as tablets. Injections given every two or three weeks worked better than when given every four weeks. However, more research is needed.
We included six RCTs involving 327 women and five NRSs involving 648 women. Five RCTs evaluated medical treatments (imiquimod, cidofovir, indole-3 carbinol), and six studies (one RCT and five NRSs) evaluated surgical treatments or photodynamic therapy.
We pooled data from three similar trials involving 104 women and found topical imiquimod cream to be more effective than placebo in clearing uVIN after a 16-week course (58% cleared with imiquimod versus 0% with placebo). Most studies did not include long-term follow-up, but findings from one small study suggested that most women in whom uVIN was completely cleared at six months were likely to sustain this response by 12 months and beyond; however, more evidence is needed. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that topical cidofovir gel has a similar effect to imiquimod on clearing uVIN lesions at six months (complete response rates were 46% and 45%, respectively). Again, we are uncertain about the longer-term effects and more evidence is needed. Side effects of imiquimod included vulval pain, redness and swelling, usually managed by reducing the frequency of applications. Headaches and tiredness occurred more frequently with imiquimod than cidofovir. The evidence for imiquimod was of moderate to high quality, and that for cidofovir was of moderate quality. Very few women were immunosuppressed, therefore we cannot be certain whether these topical treatments will be as effective in these patients.
Low-quality evidence showed that surgical excision and laser vaporisation were probably equally effective in removing uVIN lesions. However, uVIN recurrence after treatment was common, occurring in about half of women treated. The risk of vulval cancer did not differ significantly between these treatments, but there were too few cases for firm conclusions. Alternative surgical procedures that might be as effective include CUSA (ultrasonic surgical aspiration) and LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure), based on low- to very low-quality evidence, respectively. Very low-quality evidence also suggested that photodynamic therapy may also be a useful treatment option.
We found no evidence on the effectiveness of medical treatment versus surgery, or of other treatments, such as HPV vaccines; however, we identified five ongoing trials that may provide important evidence in the future. Imiquimod or cidofovir as a 16-week course appears to be effective against uVIN in about half of women treated, but more evidence is needed to prove that this effect is sustained in the longer term. It remains unknown whether topical treatments are as effective as surgery. Surgical excision and laser vaporisation may be equally effective treatments for uVIN, but about half of women will experience uVIN recurrence after either treatment. If cancer is suspected, despite a diagnosis of uVIN, surgical excision remains the treatment of choice. If cancer is not suspected, treatment should be individualised, taking into account a woman's preferences. Long-term follow-up after any treatment is essential.
We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this update. This review includes one previously identified randomised controlled trial (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) performed in 1965. This study involved 2307 young, healthy military men at a training facility in the United States Navy, and evaluated the effects of a live attenuated (weakened) adenovirus vaccine, an inactivated type 4, and an inactivated type 4 and 7 vaccines compared to a placebo (fake vaccine). The included trial was funded by a government institution. There were no differences in the frequency of occurrence of the common cold between those who received a live attenuated adenovirus vaccine compared to those who received a placebo. There were no differences between groups in adverse events. However, as the trial participants were not representative of the general population and there were flaws in the study design, our confidence in the results is very low. Further research is needed to find out if vaccines can prevent the common cold, as the current evidence does not support the use of the adenovirus vaccine to prevent the common cold in healthy people. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low due to high risk of bias; because the study population was only young men; and due to the small number of people included in the study and low numbers of colds.
This review has found only one study that compared the effects of a second round of chemotherapy with treatment showing no benefits for the patients, apart from keeping them comfortable. This study does not provide enough evidence to judge whether such treatment causes more benefits than harms and further larger studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
Four studies with 753 participants were included in this review. Three compared respite care to no respite care and one compared respite care to polarity therapy, a type of touch therapy. All studies included people with dementia and their caregivers. We were not able to pool the results of the studies as there were so few studies and they measured the outcomes in different ways. All the studies reported outcomes for the caregiver, but only one reported outcomes for the person with dementia. The three studies that compared respite care to no respite care found no evidence of any benefit of respite care for people with dementia or for their caregivers for any outcome, including rates of institutionalisation and caregiver burden. The study that compared respite care to polarity therapy found that polarity therapy decreased caregiver perceived stress but that there was no difference between polarity therapy and respite care for other measures of psychological health and other caregiver outcomes. A host of methodological problems were identified in the available trials. One study did not report data that could be analysed, the remaining three studies were very small and had a very short duration. Further methodologically sound research is needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.
Four studies with a total of 136 participants were included. Two studies compared the use of plugs versus no plugs. The involuntary loss of stool was effectively blocked (pseudo-continence) in six (38%) participants who continued to use the plugs, at least in the short-term. One study compared two sizes of the same brand of plug; due to the high dropout in this study and the incomplete data, no results concerning this comparison are available. In one study a comparison of two different brands of plug was made. Loss of plug was reported by 7 patients (30%) with a polyurethane (PU) plug and by 15 patients (65%) with the polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) plug. Overall satisfaction, defined as patients' opinion that the plug was good to very good, was reported more often for the PU plug (n = 17) than for the PVA plug (n = 8).
In all included studies there was considerable dropout; in total 48 participants (35%) dropped out before the end of the study for varying reasons. Data presented are thus subject to potential bias, and only tentative conclusions are possible. The available data suggest that anal plugs can be difficult to tolerate. However, if they are tolerated they can be helpful in preventing incontinence. Plugs could then be useful in a selected group of people either as a substitute for other forms of management or as an adjuvant treatment option. Plugs come in different designs and sizes; the review showed that the selection of the type of plug can impact on its performance.
We searched scientific databases for studies that examined protocol-directed sedation in adult and paediatric intensive care patients. We identified four studies with 3308 participants (864 adults and 2459 paediatrics) to include in this review. All of these included studies compared the use of protocol-directed sedation delivered by nurses to usual care (that is, non-protocol-directed sedation). There was no difference in the length of time mechanical ventilation was needed or in ICU or hospital deaths between people who received protocol-directed sedation and those people managed with usual care. There was a significant reduction in the number of days people treated with protocol-directed sedation spent in hospital, when compared to those managed with usual care. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of people who accidentally removed their breathing tube or required their tube to be reinserted after accidentally removing it.
In conclusion, the benefits of protocol-directed sedation delivered by nurses compared to usual care are currently unclear in relation to the important outcomes of length of time mechanical ventilation was needed or number of deaths. The evidence available to answer our review question is low to moderate. This is mainly due to the often conflicting results that were reported from the four eligible studies. Further studies need to be conducted to determine the effectiveness of this intervention.
The review included 16 randomised controlled trials (more than 1800 women) that compared these procedures for treating couples with non-tubal subfertility. Only three trials reported live birth. The evidence is current to September 2013. No trial reported its funding source, but one reported no conflict of interest, and one stated that it had received no commercial funding. No clear evidence suggests any difference between IUI and FSP with respect to their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of couples with non-tubal subfertility. However, a high level of uncertainty due to lack of data is evident in the findings. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low for most outcomes, largely because of the small quantity of available data.
We included 32 randomised controlled trials (3492 women). We pooled the results of 23 trials (2796 women). We were unable to pool the results from the remaining nine trials, because investigators either measured adhesions in a way that would not allow us to pool the findings with other data, or did not report important statistical information. We searched all evidence up to August 2019. Fluids and gels appear to be effective in reducing adhesions, but more information is needed to determine whether they affect pelvic pain or live birth rates. Large, high-quality studies should be conducted in which investigators use the standardised way of measuring adhesions, developed by the American Fertility Society (the modified AFS score). one study reported uncertain results of the effect of a fluid agent (4% icodextrin, a glucose polymer) on pelvic pain. No studies reported pelvic pain outcomes with any other interventions. the pooled results of two studies of fluid agents (dextran, another glucose polymer) found uncertain effects on live birth rates. The data suggest that in women with a 13% chance of giving birth with no treatment, 4% to 19% would give birth if treated with fluid agents. The pooled results of two studies of steroids found uncertain effects on live birth rates. The data suggest that in women with a 13% chance of giving birth with no treatment, 4% to 19% would give birth if treated with steroids. No studies reported live birth rate with any other interventions.
We are uncertain whether fluid agents, gel agents, or steroids affect clinical pregnancy rates compared with no treatment. No studies comparing the effect of fluid agents with gel agents reported clinical pregnancy rates. four studies found that fluid agents reduced the incidence of adhesions at second-look laparoscopy (SLL) compared with no treatment (high-quality evidence). This suggests that in women with an 84% chance of having adhesions at SLL with no treatment, the use of fluid agents would result in 54% to 75% having adhesions. Five studies found that gel agents reduced the incidence of adhesions at SLL compared with no treatment (high-quality evidence). This suggests that in women with an 84% chance of having adhesions at SLL with no treatment, using gel agents would result in 39% to 75% having adhesions. Three studies found that gel agents probably reduced the incidence of adhesions at SLL compared with fluid agents (moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that in women with a 46% chance of having adhesions at SLL with a fluid agent, using gel agents would result in 21% to 41% having adhesions.
Eight studies examined the effect of gel agents or fluid agents on mean adhesion score. We are uncertain if they have an effect when compared with no treatment, or with each other.
No studies reported the effect of steroids on adhesion incidence or mean adhesion scores at SLL. no studies reported any adverse events caused by the intervention being investigated. The quality of the evidence ranged from very-low to high. The main reasons for downgrading evidence were imprecision (small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals that crossed the line of no effect), and poor reporting of methods.
We wanted to identify whether autoinflation was better than no treatment, medical treatment or surgical treatment for children with OME.
We also wanted to see if there were any unwanted effects associated with autoinflation. We searched for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other treatments in children with OME. We compared and summarised the study results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with OME. Most of the studies were in children aged over three years old, and only lasted for up to three months. They compared autoinflation (carried out two to three times per day) with no treatment.
We are uncertain whether autoinflation has any effect on hearing, as there was very little evidence about this.
Autoinflation may slightly reduce the number of children who still have OME after three months of follow-up, and may result in an improvement in quality of life.
Children who use autoinflation may experience more ear pain than those who do not receive any treatment, but only one study assessed this, and the number of children with pain was small (4.4% compared to 1.3% in those who did not have treatment). We have very little information about the longer-term effects of autoinflation. A variety of different techniques and devices are available for autoinflation, and we do not know if some of these are more effective than others. The evidence is up-to-date to January 2023.
We included 25 clinical studies in which people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups (called 'randomized controlled trials'), with results reported from a total of 1688 participants (929 females, 759 males). Participants were 29 to 72 years old. Eight trials compared participants receiving adductor canal block against patients receiving saline. A total of 15 RCTs compared adductor canal block versus femoral nerve block. The evidence is current to October 2018. No trial was funded by industry. We are uncertain whether patients treated with adductor canal block have lower pain intensity at rest or during movement (e.g. walking) compared with those who received only saline. It is unclear whether rates of adverse events after taking opioids (e.g. nausea) or after accidental falls during postoperative care are lower. It is also uncertain whether patients receiving adductor canal block show different postoperative pain intensity at rest and during movement compared to those treated with femoral nerve block. We noted no differences in adverse events after taking opioids and after accidental falls. We rated the quality of evidence for many outcomes as low or very low. In contrast, we rated pain at rest (at 24 hours) as high-quality evidence.
Only randomised controlled trials were included in this review. These are studies in which two groups of patients were compared, each group receiving a different form of SLT, with patients assigned to the groups in a random fashion to reduce potential for bias.
Six trials were found with a total of 159 patients. Methods varied so much that meta-analysis of the results was not possible. Considering the small number of patients and the methodological flaws in these studies, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of one form of SLT over another for the treatment of speech problems in individuals with Parkinson's disease.
This systematic review assesses the effects of different control interventions in randomised trials including patients with a mental health disorder. In randomised trials, patients are assigned by chance to one of two or more groups – usually an experimental intervention and a control intervention. There are many types of control interventions in mental health intervention research. Some of the most common are different types of placebos that lack what is assumed to be the active component in the experimental intervention, and usual care, where patients receive the standard treatment for their mental health disorder in the area where they live. Two other types of control interventions are wait-list or no-treatment where patients receive no trial-related care during the study (although some patients may receive care outside the studies). Wait-list patients are often offered the experimental intervention after the trial has been finalised if it is likely to provide more benefits than harms, while no-treatment participants are not offered the experimental intervention by the researchers.
We searched for randomised trials with patients with mental health disorders where wait-list, usual care, or placebo interventions were compared with either wait-list or no-treatment. We looked at differences between all the types of control interventions on beneficial effects and whether they caused any adverse effects. We included 96 trials with a total of 4200 participants. Only 83 trials (3614 participants) provided usable data. Fifteen different mental health disorders were included. We found that all the trials were at high risk of bias in how they had been conducted, which reduced the interpretability of our findings. However, the risk of bias was mostly due to lack of blinding in the placebo studies, which may be seen as an aspect of the review's methodological question rather than a flaw with the review itself. We found no clinically important differences for usual care or wait-list control interventions in the main analyses, however in our secondary analyses we found a clinically important favourable difference for usual care. In general, placebo control interventions tended to be favourable over no-treatment or wait-list control interventions across mental health disorders. We found no clinically important differences on adverse events.
This review suggests that different control interventions have a tendency to yield very different estimates for the effects of the experimental intervention and that the choice of control intervention has a large impact on how effective a mental health treatment appears to be. Control interventions in trials with patients with mental health disorders are often poorly reported upon, and guidelines are needed to inform researchers on how to properly design, report, and interpret these trials.
We found 104 studies (including 111,653 participants) testing the effect of any type of telephone counselling. The participants were mostly adult smokers from the general population, but some studies also looked at teenagers, pregnant women, and people with long-term or mental health conditions.
Some studies included participants who had called helplines that provide smoking counselling (quitlines). Other studies included people who had not called quitlines, but received calls from counsellors or other healthcare providers.
Some studies provided telephone counselling alone, but many others provided telephone counselling along with minimal support such as self-help leaflets, or more active support such as face-to-face counselling, or with stop-smoking medication. The number of calls offered ranged from a single call to 12 calls. Some studies only recruited people trying to stop smoking, while others offered support even to those not actively trying to stop.
Studies needed to compare groups whose participants had similar characteristics at the start of the study, to investigate whether the participants had stopped smoking for at least six months, and ideally would test whether people had quit with blood or urine tests.
We judged few studies to be well designed and conducted. Most had at least one issue that could have affected the results. In people who had called helplines, providing additional telephone counselling increased their chances of stopping smoking from 7% to 10%. In people who had not called a helpline, but received telephone calls from counsellors or other healthcare providers, their chances of stopping smoking increased from 11% to 14%. In studies which directly compared more versus fewer calls, people who were offered more calls (three to five) tended to be more likely to quit than those who received only one call. Telephone counselling appears to increase the chances of stopping smoking, whether or not people are motivated to quit or are receiving other stop-smoking support. The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate, meaning that further research is likely to have an important impact on our conclusions.
We wanted to find out if exercise in addition to usual care improved fatigue, functional capacity (ability to perform normal everyday tasks), quality of life, pain, and disease activity, and caused no harm. We searched for studies that investigated structured exercise programmes such as aerobic exercise, resistance, stretching or combinations of these (including a specific dosage of exercise, e.g. frequency, intensity, time, type)  in addition to usual care compared with placebo (pretend medicine), usual care alone, or another non-medicine intervention (e.g. relaxation therapy) in people with SLE.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 13 studies that involved 540 participants with SLE that included a structured exercise programme that lasted up to 12 weeks in duration. Usual care included DMARDs and glucocorticoids.
The main results of the review are:
1. Whole body vibration exercise plus usual care may result in little to no effect on fatigue, functional capacity, and pain when compared to whole body placebo vibration exercise (vibration switched off) plus usual care (1 study, 17 participants).
The study measured fatigue using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue domain (FACIT-Fatigue) (0 to 52 scale, where 0 means no fatigue) and, at 12 weeks, fatigue improved by 5 points in the exercise group compared to the group that did not exercise:
– People who exercised rated their fatigue at 33 points.
– People who did not exercise rated their fatigue at 38 points.
The study measured functional capacity using the Functional Capacity domain in the 36-item Short Form health questionnaire (SF-36) (0 to 100 scale, where 100 means best function) and, at 12 weeks, function worsened by 2.5 points in the exercise group compared to the group that did not exercise:
– People who exercised rated their functional capacity at 67.5 points.
– People who did not exercise rated their functional capacity at 70 points.
The study measured pain on the Pain domain of the SF-36 (0 to 100 scale, where 0 means no pain) and, at 12 weeks, pain improved by 9 points in the exercise group compared to the group that did not exercise:
– People who exercised rated their pain at 34 points.
– People who did not exercise rated their pain at 43 points.
More people from the exercise group (27%) withdrew from the study compared those in the placebo group (10%).
The study did not measure disease activity or quality of life.
2. Exercise plus usual care may result in little to no effect on fatigue, functional capacity, and disease activity when compared to usual care alone. And we are uncertain whether exercise improves pain when compared to usual care alone.
3. Exercise plus usual care may reduce fatigue, improve functional capacity, and probably results in little to no difference in disease activity, and may result in little to no difference in pain when compared to another non-medicine intervention plus usual care.
No studies reported any serious side effects that were related to the exercise programme during or following the intervention. We have little confidence in the evidence because the number of studies was very small, and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.
Most studies assessed the effectiveness of exercise for a short duration (12 weeks or less) and it is unclear if people would adhere to exercise over time. More rigorous studies of structured exercise over a period of time longer than 12 weeks are needed to improve our confidence in the benefits and safety of exercise in people with SLE. The evidence is up to date to 30 March 2022.
We searched for evidence in November 2016 and identified 14 randomised controlled trials of iodine supplements in the form of tablets, capsules, drops or injections before, during or after pregnancy. Eleven trials with over 2700 women contributed findings to the review. Eight trials compared iodine with no treatment or a placebo and three trials compared iodine given with other vitamins and minerals against only the vitamins and minerals.
Women who received iodine supplements were less likely to develop the unwanted effect of hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) after giving birth (three trials involving 543 women) but they were more likely to experience nausea or vomiting during pregnancy (one trial involving 76 women) when compared to those who did not receive iodine. One trial (365 women) did not find any difference in the number of women with an overactive thyroid gland during pregnancy. The number of women with an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) was not clearly different either during pregnancy (one trial involving 365 women) or after giving birth (three trials involving 540 women) when iodine supplements were given. A similar number of women had raised thyroid antibodies during pregnancy (one trial, 359 women) and after giving birth (three trials, 397 women). We found no clear differences between women given iodine supplements and those not when looking at preterm births (two trials, 376 women) or deaths around the time of giving birth (two trials, 457 women), babies born with a low birthweight (two trials, 377 babies), newborn babies with an underactive thyroid gland (two trials, 260 babies) or with raised thyroid antibodies (one trial, 108 babies).
The quality of the evidence was low to very low, mostly because few trials looked at each outcome or because of limitations in the study designs. Most of the findings were from one or two trials and small numbers of women were included. This means we are not confident in the results. The potential benefits and harms of any intervention must be weighed as part of deciding whether to use it. Our Cochrane Review provides a summary of the evidence but there were not enough data for any meaningful conclusions on the benefits and harms of routine iodine supplementation in women before, during or after pregnancy. The limited information we found suggests there are benefits and risks of iodine supplementation. More research will clarify the effects and safety of this intervention. Future research should use randomised controlled trial designs where practical and ethical, and include the outcomes from this review.
This review evaluated 11 studies which included 851 participants with 879 front and back teeth which had undergone root canal treatment. Sodium hypochlorite in a range of strengths was the most commonly used irrigating solution, followed by chlorhexidine as a solution or a gel. The amount of pain experienced immediately after treatment and between appointments did not appear to differ either between some of the irrigants or between the different strengths of individual irrigants. Limited data suggested that higher strength concentrations of sodium hypochlorite solution and a final rinse with chlorhexidine may be more effective than other irrigants at destroying bacteria.
The updated evidence is current to August 2015. We found only three appropriate studies with a total of 1158 participants to include. Data primarily came from one high-quality study with 1000 participants. Our analysis showed that in good grade patients, it remains possible that cooling the brain during surgery might prevent death or dependency in everyday activities. Very limited information was available for those without bleeding or those with poor grade bleeding. Unfavourable outcomes did not differ between participants with or without hypothermia. The quality of evidence for these outcomes remains unclear because they were reported in a variety of ways. We do not have enough data to be certain about the effect of cooling on death or dependency. The evidence for other outcomes was more uncertain, since we could not combine the data due to variation in the definition and reporting of outcome data. Data in our analyses were primarily from one high quality trial on good grade participants.
This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin α1 is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts. However, the use of purified thymus extracts should be investigated more thoroughly before the extracts are used routinely in patients. The findings were not conclusive and caution is advised. Overall, thymic peptides seem to be well tolerated.
Only randomised controlled trials were included in this review. These were studies where a group of participants were given one physiotherapy intervention and were compared with another group who received a different physiotherapy intervention. The participants were assigned to a group in a random fashion to reduce the potential for bias.
A total of 43 randomised trials involving 1673 participants (average trial size of just 39 participants) were identified as suitable for this review. The trials assessed various physiotherapy interventions, so they were grouped according to the type of intervention being used (general physiotherapy, exercise, treadmill training, cueing, dance or martial arts). However, despite this grouping, the physiotherapy interventions delivered and the outcomes assessed varied so much that the results of the individual trials could not be combined.
This review highlights that a wide range of different physiotherapy techniques have been tested to treat PD. Considering the small number of participants, the wide variety of physiotherapy interventions and the outcomes assessed, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of one approach of physiotherapy intervention over another for the treatment of PD.
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the role of vitrectomy in the treatment of endophthalmitis. We conducted a systematic review of studies of people with endophthalmitis who had undergone vitrectomy for the treatment of endophthalmitis following surgery or an eye injury. We identified one randomised control trial (RCT) that studied vitrectomy compared to antibiotic eye injections in endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. The single RCT suggested that vitrectomy had no advantage over standard treatment of intravitreal antibiotics alone. The results of our review were based on a single RCT, which was conducted over 27 years ago. Since this time there have been several surgical advances that may potentially alter the outcome of people undergoing vitrectomy. We searched for studies up to 5 May 2022.
We wanted to find out:
- whether cleaning venous leg ulcers helps them to become smaller and heal;
- whether some cleaning solutions, or methods of applying solutions, are more effective than others;
- which cleaning solution people prefer and find easiest to use;
- whether cleaning wounds has an impact on quality of life;
- how much cleaning wounds costs; and
- whether cleaning wounds is associated with adverse (unwanted) effects such as pain, infection or skin damage. First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where the treatment or care people receive is chosen at random). These studies provide the most reliable health evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. We found four studies that involved a total of 254 people with venous leg ulcers. There were 108 men and 144 women, all over 18 years old (information about gender was missing for two people).
The studies compared the effects of:
- a disinfectant and antiseptic agent (polyhexamethylene biguanide) applied using a syringe with a needle to flush (irrigate) the ulcer with fluid, against a salt (saline) solution;
- a gentle spray of a bleaching and antiseptic agent (aqueous oxygen peroxide, which is ozone dissolved in water), against sterile water;
- a detergent (propyl betaine combined with polyhexanide), against a saline solution – method of application not reported; and
- an antiseptic (octenidine dihydrochloride combined with phenoxyethanol) sprayed onto the wound, against a solution of several salts dissolved in water (Ringer’s solution).
No studies compared cleaning with no cleaning, or compared different cleaning methods.
We cannot tell whether cleaning wounds is beneficial or associated with any unwanted effects. This is because we have too little confidence in the evidence available regarding healing, changes in ulcer size, pain and unwanted effects. No study reported on patient preference, ease of use, cost or impact on quality of life. We do not know whether cleaning solutions are better than sterile water or saline solutions to help venous leg ulcers heal, or whether the choice of cleaning solution or method of application makes any difference to venous leg ulcer healing. Our confidence in the available evidence is very low. The results of our review are likely to change if more evidence becomes available. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to September 2019.
Where possible, urinary incontinence following prostate surgery can be managed using non-surgical and non-pharmacological interventions such as pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), electrical or magnetic stimulation, lifestyle modifications (such as diet or water intake), as well as combinations of these. However, there is currently uncertainty surrounding the benefits of these treatments. Therefore, we wanted to find out whether undertaking non-surgical and non-pharmacological interventions helps manage urinary incontinence in men who have undergone prostate surgery. We searched for studies investigating the effects of non-surgical and non-pharmacological treatments on urinary incontinence in men who have undergone prostate surgery. We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated the confidence we had in our findings based on the studies' methods, size and results. We found 25 studies including a total of 3079 men. Twenty-three of these recruited men who had previously undergone a form of radical prostate surgery, where the entire prostate is removed. Only one study recruited men who had previously undergone transurethral resection of the prostate, a procedure where parts of the prostate are removed through the penis. We were unclear on what type of surgery men in one study had undergone.
Four studies stated that they did not receive any funding, while seven were funded solely by governmental organisations and one solely by a foundation. One study was funded by a governmental organisation and a university, one by a charity and a university and one through both charity and a pharmaceutical company. Ten studies did not report where they had obtained funding for their study. Four studies reported on PFMT plus biofeedback versus no treatment, sham treatment and/or verbal or written instructions to perform the intervention. PFMT plus biofeedback may result in more men reporting cure of incontinence from 6 to 12 months. However, men undertaking PFMT and biofeedback may be less likely to be cured according to clinicians' measures at from 6 to 12 months. It is uncertain whether undertaking PFMT and biofeedback has an effect on surface- or skin-related adverse events (e.g. skin reactions or bruising) or muscle-related side-effects (e.g. soreness or discomfort). Condition-specific quality of life, participant adherence to the intervention and general quality of life were not reported by any study for this comparison.
Eleven studies assessed combinations of conservative treatments versus no treatment, sham treatment and/or verbal or written instructions to perform the intervention. Combinations of treatments may lead to little difference in the number of men reporting cure or improvement of incontinence between 6 and 12 months. Combinations of treatments probably lead to little difference in condition-specific quality of life and probably little difference in general quality of life between 6 and 12 months. There is little difference between combinations of treatments and control in terms of cure or improvement of incontinence using clinicians' measures between 6 and 12 months. However, it is uncertain whether participant adherence to the intervention between 6 and 12 months is increased for those undertaking combinations of treatments. There is probably no difference between combinations and control in terms of the number of men experiencing surface- or skin-related side-effects but it is uncertain whether combinations of treatments lead to more men experiencing muscle-related side effects.
We did not identify any studies assessing electrical or magnetic stimulation versus no intervention, sham or verbal or written instructions that reported on our key outcomes of interest. The certainty of the evidence identified was mixed, ranging from very low-certainty to high-certainty evidence. Our concerns mainly surrounded how many participants were involved in the studies, as studies were often small. We also had concerns that there may have been bias introduced into many studies. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether evidence from open/laparoscopic surgery is applicable to robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The evidence is up to date to 22 April 2022.
We wanted to find out if any intervention was better than another to:
1. improve how teeth are aligned;
2. reduce the severity of any other dental complications;
3. reduce unwanted effects of treatment;
4. reduce pain;
5. reduce infections after dental treatment using preventive antibiotics;
6. improve quality of life; or
7. reduce the effects on professional and academic functions (e.g. loss or change of job, number of days off work or school). We searched for studies that evaluated any treatment for dental or orthodontic problems in people with thalassaemia. We summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found only one study suitable for inclusion in our review. This trial was conducted in a clinical setting in Saudi Arabia and enroled 29 people with thalassaemia. One group of participants received treatment with a light stimulation device in the infected areas of the gums in addition to professional full-mouth cleaning, and the other group received professional full-mouth cleaning only. Full-mouth cleaning plus light stimulation may reduce some aspects of gum inflammation more than full-mouth cleaning alone. The study did not report any of our other outcomes of interest listed above. The study did not examine the effects of treatment beyond 12 weeks; nor did it examine unwanted effects of treatment. For these reasons, we have little confidence in the evidence. We cannot make definitive clinical recommendations based on this one study. The evidence is current to January 2022.
We wanted to find out which antiseptic, soap or alcohol is better for hand hygiene to prevent infection in newborns in the community and healthcare centres.
We also wanted to find out if any of the hand hygiene products will cause harm to mothers and healthcare workers. We searched for studies carried out in the communities or healthcare centres that compared the benefits and risks of any form of hand hygiene products (like soap, antiseptic, alcohol, hand sanitisers, or handrubs) against another type or against no hand hygiene products for prevention of infection in newborns. We searched for relevant studies up to July 2021. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on the quality of the studies We included six studies that involved nurses working in intensive care units of hospitals, all neonates on admission, and pregnant women in community settings. Three of the studies involved 279 nurses, and one study did not clearly report how many nurses were recruited into the study; two other studies included 361 pregnant women from community settings. Studies compared 'antiseptic detergent' versus alcohol hand rub (sanitiser); 'antiseptic detergent' versus plain soap; alcohol hand sanitiser versus 'usual care'; antiseptic detergent versus 'usual care' and antiseptic that contained iodine versus another (prepodyne versus betadine).
Two percent antiseptic detergent may reduce the risk of bacteria infections in neonates compared to alcohol hand sanitiser within the first 28 days of life. Overall, our review provides no strong evidence to support better effectiveness of one hand hygiene intervention compared to another for preventing infection in newborns. None of the five included studies examined other important issues such as the duration of hospital stay. There was not much difference in the undesirable effects of various hand hygiene interventions on the skin of caregivers.
In conclusion, we are not sure of the hand hygiene intervention that is better for preventing infection in newborn babies. We assessed only a few studies that involved small numbers of nurses and babies. In addition, most of the assessed studies had high risk of bias. Larger studies with low risk of bias are needed so reliable conclusions can be reached. We do not have sufficient information that would allow us to reach meaningful conclusions pertaining to which hand hygiene product is better for the prevention of newborn infection as many of the included studies had issues with how they were carried out. We have no confidence in the available evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of these hand hygiene interventions for preventing infection in newborns. Sources of funding were declared by four of the included studies, but two studies did not report how they were funded. The evidence is up-to-date to 12 December 2022.
The search was up-to-date to September 2020. We included 10 trials, enrolling 581 infants with NAS caused by maternal opioid use in pregnancy, in the review. There were multiple comparisons of different sedatives and regimens. The addition of phenobarbital to supportive care increased duration of hospitalisation and treatment, but reduced duration supportive care each day compared to supportive care alone. Phenobarbital reduced treatment failure compared to both diazepam and chlorpromazine. Clonidine and opioid compared to phenobarbital and opioid increased in days of hospitalisation and days of treatment. There were insufficient data to determine the safety and incidence of side effects for infants treated with combinations of opioids and sedatives including phenobarbital and clonidine. Side effects reported in infants treated with an opioid included oversedation from the addition of phenobarbital, and low blood pressure from the addition of clonidine with rebound high blood pressure and NAS reported after stopping clonidine. We found one ongoing study of clonidine plus morphine for NAS. This was low to very low for all results.
However, the review of trials found conflicting evidence about whether or not IPC is better than compression bandages and hosiery. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is better for healing leg ulcers than no compression. . Some studies suggest IPC might be a beneficial addition to bandages for some ulcers, but these studies might be biased. Delivering the IPC therapy in a rapid manner by inflating and deflating the IPC device more quickly resulted in more ulcers being healed than with a slower deflation regime.
One type of drug (gabapentin and pregabalin), an analogue to a common neurotransmitter appear to reduce itch in patients with CKD. Ondansetron, an anti-nausea drug, was another well studied treatment and appears have no significant association with itch reduction. Kappa-opioid drugs (nalfurafine) appear to slightly reduce itch. There is too little information on the remaining treatments for any thorough assessment of their efficacy in relieving itch or whether there is any anti-itch effect at all.
The three drugs mentioned above are well studied with higher quality evidence. The other treatments studied are of lower to moderate quality.
The studies seldom document a comprehensive list of adverse or side effects incurred during treatment. However, none of the adverse effects documented were severe. Further meaningful assessment on harm cannot be made. Drugs that work like neurotransmitters (gabapentin and pregabalin) reduce itch in patients with CKD. Other intervention either do not work, do not work as well, or need further study to make a conclusion.
This review found six mostly small studies with some limitations in their methods. All six studies were conducted in the neonatal nursery of a major tertiary hospital. In all studies, researchers enrolled preterm infants of average postmenstrual age of 29 weeks (nearly two and a half months preterm). Some studies enrolled twins only; others enrolled twins and triplets and quadruplets and chose to co-bed two of the higher-order multiples considered most stable at the time of enrollment. Overall, researchers reported no differences between the co-bedded group and the group receiving care separately in terms of weight gain, episodes of major disturbances in their breathing, heart rate or oxygenation level (apnea, bradycardia, or desaturation episodes), length of hospital stay, and occurrence of infection. Conflicting results were noted in the two included studies that assessed infants' pain response after heel prick. Overall quality of evidence was low because of limitations in study methods, small sample sizes giving rise to imprecise results, and inconsistency in study results. We can make no recommendations for or against co-bedding for stable preterm twins in the neonatal nursery on the basis of evidence gathered in this review. Further research on this topic is needed.
The evidence was current to 7 April 2014. We included 12 studies involving 9547 COPD patients over a period of four to 52 weeks. These studies were sponsored by drug companies and were well designed. Both patients and the people doing the research did not know which treatment the patients were getting; although in one study one treatment was known to both parties. More men than women took part, and they were mostly Caucasians. They were in their 60s and had smoked a lot in their lives. These people had moderate to severe symptoms when they started treatment. Aclidinium did not reduce the number of people with flare-ups that need additional drugs. There was little or no difference in deaths or serious side effects between aclidinium and a dummy inhaler. Aclidinium inhalers improved quality of life more than the dummy inhalers.
People who took aclidinium had fewer hospital admissions due to serious flare-ups. Based on our results, among 1000 COPD patients using a dummy inhaler over four weeks to one year 37 would have severe flare-ups needing hospital admission. Only 17 to 33 patients out of 1000 would require hospital admission if they were using aclidinium inhalers. We also set out to compare this new medication with tiotropium, which is already used to treat COPD. There were only two studies for this comparison thus we could not be sure how aclidinium compared to tiotropium. We also could not compare aclidinium with another well known inhaler that contains the drug formoterol because of unreliable data. For the comparison of aclidinium inhalers and dummy inhalers, we are confident that there are benefits in terms of the number of hospitalisations and patients' quality of life; we are less certain about the numbers of flare-ups needing additional drugs and serious side effects. We do not have enough information to assess any effect on the number of deaths. We did not have enough information to reliably compare aclidinium with tiotropium or formoterol.
The evidence we reviewed is current to August 2012. We found seven studies that matched our criteria. There were three from memory clinics (specialist clinics where people are referred for suspected dementia), two from general hospital clinics, none from primary care and two studies carried out in the general population. All studies included older people, with the youngest average age of 61 years in one study. There were a total 9422 people included in all 7 studies though only one study had more than 350 people.
The proportion of people with dementia was 5% to 10% in two population-derived studies and 22% to 54% in the five clinic-based studies. There was a large variation in the way the different studies were carried out: therefore we chose to present the results in a narrative summary because a statistical summary (combining all the estimates into a summary sensitivity and specificity) would not have been meaningful. We found that MoCA was good at detecting dementia when using a recognised cut-off score of less than 26. In the studies that used this cut-off, we found the test correctly detected over 94% of people with dementia in all settings. On the other hand, the test also produced a high proportion of false positives, that is people who did not have dementia but tested positive at the 'less than 26' cut-off. In the studies we reviewed, over 40% of people without dementia would have been incorrectly diagnosed with dementia using the MoCA. The overall quality of the studies was not good enough to make firm recommendations on using the MoCA to detect dementia in different healthcare settings. In particular, no studies looked at how useful MoCA is for diagnosing dementia in primary care settings. It is likely that a MoCA threshold lower than 26 would be more useful for optimal diagnostic accuracy in dementia, though this requires wider confirmation.
The evidence is current to July 2017, based on a total of 16 clinical trials which treated people between 1984 and 2007. Four eligible trials were excluded due to failure to obtain individual patient data, while one further eligible trial was identified only in 2015 and data were not sought. For each of the five study questions (see above), data from between three and six trials with between 1101 and 2996 participants were analysed. Each trial's data covered a follow-up period of between six and 11 years. All included trials employed modern, widely accepted forms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients were non-elderly adults of both sexes with early or advances stage disease, according to study question. All trials were funded by public bodies or charities without any direct industry funding. In the comparison of chemotherapy alone versus same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (all stages), the use of chemotherapy without additional radiotherapy was associated with a lower second cancer risk but possibly at the cost of more growth or regrowth of the disease.
In the comparison of chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus extended-field radiation (early stages), neither second cancer risk, survival or Hodgkin-free survival was markedly different.
In the comparison of chemotherapy plus lower-dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus higher-dose radiation (early stages), neither second cancer risk, survival or Hodgkin-free survival was markedly different.
In the comparison of fewer versus more courses of chemotherapy (early stages), neither second cancer risk, survival or Hodgkin-free survival was markedly different.
In the comparison of dose-intensified versus ABVD-like chemotherapy (advanced stages), dose-intensified chemotherapy improved Hodgkin-free survival, compared with ABVD-like regimens, at the cost of a greater risk of secondary leukaemia. Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified chemotherapy was not conclusive, although escalated-dose BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival. Evidence concerning survival and Hodgkin-free survival was of at least moderate quality, while evidence concerning second cancer risk was partly of low quality due to the small numbers of second cancers observed in the trials and too short follow-up. Thus, conclusions on second cancer risk remain tentative until more longer-term data are available. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results.
The risk of secondary leukaemia is increased among patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols; on the other hand these regimens improve Hodgkin-free survival. Treatment decisions have to be tailored for the individual patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define a patient population that can safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced dose radiotherapy did not appear to markedly affect Hodgkin-free survival or secondary malignancy risk.
In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. Fifty-nine randomised controlled trials (about 10,000 participants) were included in the review. The review showed evidence of differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability between sertraline and other antidepressants, with meta-analyses highlighting a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressants, both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, in a homogeneous sample of clinical trials, using conservative statistical methods. The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients and their carers' attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning, were not reported in the included studies. Nevertheless, based on currently available evidence, results from this review suggest that sertraline might be a strong candidate as the initial choice of antidepressant in people with acute major depression.
Clinical drug trials or studies are usually conducted to assess how well the drug works but also whether it causes any harm (side effects or adverse effects). Adverse effects can be detected by the trial doctor examining participants or taking some blood samples or doing other kinds of tests. The trial staff can also ask participants about how they are feeling after taking the trial drug. However, the way participants are asked about their health can vary from trial to trial, or even within a trial. In some trials, participants may be asked a simple open question such as 'how have you been feeling?', while in other trials, participants may be asked about whether they have had any of a long list of possible symptoms (such as 'have you had a headache, stomach ache, or sore muscles?'). There has been concern that these different kinds of questions and how they are phrased will impact on what participants report about their health during a trial. This might then affect the trial's results and what we know about the side effects of drugs.
We did this review to look at studies that compared different types of participant questioning methods in order to investigate these issues. We found 33 studies comparing mainly open questions with checklist-type questions, but also some ratings scales and participant interviews. While the studies were all very different in terms of the types of disease, drugs, and patients studied, we found in general that, as would be expected, when a more specific type of question was asked (like a checklist), participants reported more symptoms. What is interesting is that, in those studies that looked more closely at the types of symptoms reported, it seems that an open question picks up the more severe or bothersome symptoms compared to a checklist-type question. However, some studies found that even quite severe or bothersome symptoms were not reported when a participant is asked an open question and these severe symptoms will only be reported with the more specific question. This makes it difficult to say whether one method is better than any other and the different questioning methods may, in fact, be complementary and therefore should be used together. It is also difficult to say what a specific question should include, as it might take too long for a participant to have to answer a very long list. While more research is needed to resolve the remaining uncertainties, it is very important for trials to be clear about which kind of questioning was used when they publish their results. This will help readers understand the trial's findings about the side effects and make it easier to make accurate comparisons between trials.
This review evaluated existing therapeutic strategies that target the creatine kinase system in cardiovascular disease. The available trials indicate an improvement in abnormal heart rhythm and shortness of breath in heart disease. The effect on death and the size of myocardial infarction and the heart function were unclear. Given the small sample size of the discussed trials and the heterogeneity of the population included in these reports, larger clinical studies are needed to confirm these observations.
We found 25 randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 3378 women who underwent surgery with or without medical therapy. We used the term "surgery alone" to refer to placebo or no medical therapy. The evidence is current to November 2019. Medical therapy showed variable effects on pain, reappearance of pain or disease, and pregnancy rate when used before or after surgery for endometriosis. However, for outcomes disease recurrence and pregnancy, it may be most effective after surgery versus surgery alone compared to other comparisons reviewed. Very weak evidence suggests that if pelvic pain recurrence at 12 months or less is 24% among women having surgery alone, the chance with medical therapy before surgery would be between 17% and 40%.
Very weak evidence suggests that if disease recurrence at 12 months or less is 45% among women having surgery alone, the chance with medical therapy before surgery would be between 39% and 65%.
Very weak evidence suggests that if pregnancy rate is 58% among women having surgery alone, the chance with medical therapy before surgery would be between 53% and 79%. Weak evidence suggests that if pain recurrence at 12 months or less is 26% among women having surgery alone, the chance with medical therapy after surgery would be between 13% and 24%.
Weak evidence suggests that if disease recurrence at 12 months or less is 17% among women having surgery alone, the chance with medical therapy after surgery would be between 3% and 9%.
Very weak evidence suggests that if disease recurrence at 12 months or less (different classification used) is 45% among women having surgery alone, the chance with medical therapy after surgery would be between 30% and 52%.
Moderate-quality evidence suggests that if pregnancy rate is 34% among women having surgery alone, the chance with medical therapy after surgery would be between 35% and 48%. Weak evidence suggests that if pelvic pain recurrence at 12 months or less is 20% among women having medical therapy after surgery, the chance with medical therapy before surgery would be between 19% and 41%.
Very weak evidence suggests that if disease recurrence at 12 months or less is 40% among women having medical therapy after surgery, the chance with medical therapy before surgery would be between 39% and 66%.
Very weak evidence suggests that if pregnancy rate is 60% among women having medical therapy after surgery, the chance with medical therapy before surgery would be between 54% and 78%. The evidence was of very low to moderate quality.
We included eight randomized studies that involved a total of 829 participants 18 years of age and older. All participants had elective surgeries and needed general anaesthesia. Researchers directly compared cLMA against pLMA for providing artificial breathing during surgery.
We identified six cross-over studies that are awaiting classification; one is completed but has not been published, and five other studies are gathering data related to the first treatment period that are not yet available. Five studies did not report any funding sources. Of the remaining three studies, one reported that the Laryngeal Mask Company sponsored some data but was not involved in study design, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. The Joseph Drown Foundation, in Los Angeles, Califiornia, in the USA, partially supported another study. One of the authors of the final study had received research funds from Intavent Ltd, manufacturer of both types of laryngeal mask airway, but Intavent Ltd did not sponsor this study. We are unsure whether these devices exhibit important differences in providing adequate oxygenation and ventilation because there was not enough data to enable us to draw any firm conclusions. ProSeal laryngeal mask airway may provides a better seal because it leaks at higher pressure, but Classic laryngeal mask airway may be quicker to insert. However, these findings are not important clinically. We assessed all of the included studies as providing low-quality evidence because anaesthetists knew which device was being used on which participants (although this was probably unavoidable), and because it was unclear whether the investigator who collected the data was unaware of the intervention. This fact created the potential for bias.
We searched medical databases for studies of dipyrone used to treat pain following surgery in adults and compared with placebo (a pretend treatment). The medicines could be given by mouth, into a vein, into a muscle, or into the rectum. The evidence is current to 11 August 2015. We found eight studies, involving 809 participants treated with dipyrone, placebo, and various other painkillers. The studies were all small, but otherwise of moderate to good quality. A single 500 mg dose of dipyrone provided effective pain relief (50% or more reduction in pain over four to six hours) for 7 in 10 (70%) participants, compared with 3 in 10 (30%) with placebo (five studies, 288 participants in the comparison; moderate quality evidence), and fewer participants need additional painkillers within four to six hours (7% with dipyrone, 34% with placebo; four studies, 248 participants; low quality evidence).
There were too few data to compare dipyrone directly with other painkillers.
There was too little information available to draw any conclusions about other doses and ways of giving dipyrone used in these studies, or about the number of people who had side effects. The studies reported no serious side effects or people withdrawing from the studies because of side effects, although not all studies provided information on these outcomes.
We judged that all studies had significant risk of bias. The studies did not explain how people were allocated to treatment groups and did not say whether investigators knew which treatment people were receiving. Alongside other reasons, this reduced our confidence (certainty) in the results. Overall, we are uncertain to very uncertain whether the results we have reported are reliable. The true effect of vigabatrin could be significantly different to that reported here. Vigabatrin may significantly reduce seizure frequency for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy but we are uncertain. Most of the evidence was gathered from adults, therefore, the effects of vigabatrin could be different in children. All of the included trials were of short duration; therefore, we cannot report any long-term effects of vigabatrin. Importantly, reviews of long-term studies have reported that long-term vigabatrin use can lead to the development of visual problems.
This review includes data from eight randomised trials on tranexamic acid. Two trials also assessed antiulcer drugs. Only one trial used additional endoscopic therapy, as the remaining trials were performed before this intervention was introduced into clinical practice. These trials found that tranexamic acid appears to have a beneficial effect on mortality, but a high dropout rate in some trials means that we cannot be sure of these findings until additional research is published . Tranexamic acid did not reduce mortality in the trials that included antiulcer drugs or endoscopic therapy. Additional randomised controlled trials are needed before we can determine whether tranexamic acid has a beneficial effect on serious or uncontrolled upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Many patients who were randomly assigned were subsequently excluded from the assessment. The main source of bias was therefore attrition. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
To determine whether routine screening with mammography and ultrasonography is beneficial, a study (ideally a randomised controlled trial (RCT), that is a study in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing whether disease progression and death rates differ between methods is essential. None of the studies, which followed women for one to three years, lasted long enough to determine whether more cancer cases detected during screening with mammography and ultrasonography lead to reductions in disease and death. We found one RCT and seven cohort studies (a type of study in which groups of people are followed over time) that analysed whether the combination of mammography and ultrasonography is more effective than mammography alone for early detection of breast cancer in women at average risk of breast cancer with no symptoms.
The methods of the RCT were sound, and the study represented the best evidence currently available. The study included 72,717 women at average risk for breast cancer, 58% of whom had dense breast tissue. After a two-year follow-up, women screened once with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography had two more breast cancers detected per 1000 women compared with women screened with mammography (5.0 versus 3.2 per 1000 women screened). A recent publication analysed a subgroup of the RCT of 19,213 women, and reported results separately for women with dense and non-dense breasts.
In women with dense breasts, three more breast cancers per 1000 women were detected with mammography and ultrasonography than with mammography alone. This finding was supported by real-world evidence: the combined result of three cohort studies examining a total of 50,327 women with dense breasts found additional cancers in women with dense breasts when mammography screening was supplemented with ultrasonography. In women with non-dense breasts, the results of two cohort studies with data from 40,636 women were not consistent with the RCT and found no significant difference in the proportion of cancer cases between the two screening methods. In the RCT, 71% of all tumours identified at screening were classified as invasive, with no significant difference between the two groups. However, the result for the difference between the two groups was imprecise, and our confidence in the result is low. In women with invasive cancer found by mammography screening combined with ultrasonography, lymph nodes were affected in fewer cases than in the group screened by mammography alone (18% (23 of 128) versus 34% (29 of 86)). The RCT also showed that cancers that were not found during screening examinations (but were found in the time period between examinations) occurred less frequently when screening was performed with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography (5 versus 10 per 10,000) than when screening was performed with mammography alone. The rate of false-negative results, indicating a negative result when cancer is present, was lower (9% versus 23%) when ultrasonography was performed in addition to mammography. However, the combination of mammography and ultrasound resulted in more false-positives than mammography alone in women without cancer: 123 versus 86 per 1000 women. Moreover, of 1000 women screened with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography, 27 more needed a biopsy than with mammography alone. We searched for studies published up to May 2021. It is unclear whether or to what extent ultrasonography in addition to mammography screening can reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer therefore ultrasonography should not be used on a routine basis. For women to make an informed decision, we need to assess whether the few additional cancers that can be detected by ultrasonography actually result in a decrease in breast cancer disease and death.
In this review, the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants for amphetamine abuse or dependence were studied. We found eleven studies enrolling 791 amphetamine-dependent participants and assessing the effects of four different psychostimulants: dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil. Psychosocial interventions were additionally provided to all participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Australia or Northern Europe, and study length ranged from 8 to 20 weeks.
Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use or amphetamine craving and also did not increase sustained abstinence in comparison with placebo. Retention in treatment was similar and low with both treatments. Psychostimulants also did not increase the risk of adverse events that were intense enough to induce dropouts.
Research with larger and longer trials is needed to determine whether psychostimulants can be a useful replacement therapy for patients with amphetamine abuse or dependence. The design of future trials should consider the level of dependence at study entry, the potency and the dose of the psychostimulant administered, the length of the trial and the representativeness of included participants.
We wanted to find out which medical treatments are effective for the management of traumatic hyphema, a condition in which blood collects in the anterior segment (front of the eye) following significant trauma (physical injury to the eye). It was important to evaluate possible treatments for traumatic hyphema, because complications from the condition can affect final vision. We searched for studies that looked at a medical (non-surgical) treatment compared with another medical treatment or comparison group in people with traumatic hyphema. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 30 studies with a total of 2969 participants addressing our review question. Studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, China, South Africa, Malaysia, Iran, and Israel. The studies included more males than females, and participants tended to be children or young adults. Treatments included antifibrinolytic agents taken orally or applied directly to the eye (aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and aminomethylbenzoic acid), oral or topical corticosteroids, other kinds of eye drops, aspirin, estrogens, traditional Chinese medicine, patching, elevation of the head, and bed rest. Most studies looked at how often fresh bleeding occurred, because this secondary bleeding is often associated with more complications. Other outcomes examined included visual acuity and the length of time it took for the blood in the eye to be absorbed. We found no evidence that any medical treatment affected final vision, but we graded the evidence as generally of low certainty. Antifibrinolytic agents did appear to reduce the risk of new bleeding in the eye, but participants taking oral aminocaproic acid (an antifibrinolytic agent) appeared to have more nausea and vomiting compared with those in the comparison group. It was unclear whether antifibrinolytics reduced complications of secondary bleeding, as these events occurred infrequently in the studies. We found no evidence for the effectiveness of any other medical treatment in reducing the rate of fresh bleeding or the number of complications. The evidence for a beneficial effect of any of the evaluated treatments was uncertain because the numbers of participants and events were small. We reviewed studies published up to 22 March 2022.
The one included trial, of donepezil compared with placebo in 15 patients, showed no statistically significant difference in length of delirium. No other outcomes were measured.
We found three small trials (in total 223 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes) looking at different blood glucose targets: very tight, tight, moderate, and loose. The quality of the studies and therefore the strength of the evidence was very low or low, so future research may change the results.
There were very few differences between very tight and tight-moderate blood glucose targets in two trials, although there were more cases of low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) and longer hospital stays for women who had very tight blood glucose control.
A single trial compared tight, moderate, and loose blood glucose targets. In the loose target group, more women had pre-eclampsia, and there were more caesareans and large babies. There were few differences between the tight and moderate groups, although more women in the tight control group had low blood glucose in the first half of pregnancy. The evidence does not show much difference between moderate, tight and very tight blood glucose targets, although a loose blood glucose target may be worse for mothers and babies. However, the studies were small and the evidence is weak, so we do not yet know the best blood glucose target for women who have diabetes before becoming pregnant.
Results from both trials provide some evidence that giving children with CP bisphosphonate treatment for at least six months, may improve their bone strength. The strength of this effect could only be measured in one trial with 12 participants. This suggested an average improvement in bone strength of 18%, measured by bone mineral density (BMD). However, because of the very small number of participants in both trials, the wide variation in results, and some problems with the way the trials were conducted, this conclusion is uncertain.
Each study reported the results of changes in blood markers of bone strength in a different way, meaning we have inconclusive evidence, and cannot draw conclusions regarding the effects of bisphosphonate treatment.
Neither trial reported any significant risks or serious adverse outcomes among the children undergoing bisphosphonate treatment.
Neither trial examined the question of whether bisphosphonate treatment had an effect on changes in actual bone density, nor the rate of fractures of children with CP. We have limited confidence as to whether bisphosphonate treatment may improve bone health in children with CP.
Further studies are required to assess the benefit and risks of bisphosphonate treatment in children with CP. Future studies of bisphosphonate should examine the effects of bisphosphonate combined with other new treatment options.
In this review we investigated the use of TwHF as an immunosuppressive therapy for patients with primary NS. We only considered two standardised TwHF extracts which have lower toxicity profiles and fewer adverse effects than other non-standardised preparations. We reviewed the evidence from 10 randomised studies enrolling 630 Chinese patients with primary NS. Of these, four studies (293 patients) reported that when TwHF was used there was a significantly increased number of patients achieving complete, and complete or partial remission without increasing adverse events. There were no significant differences in complete, partial, or complete or partial remission when TwHF was compared with prednisone in four studies (223 patients). There were also no significant differences in complete, partial, or complete or partial remission when TwHF was compared with CPA in two studies (114 patients). One study reported TwHF significantly improved kidney function (decreased serum creatinine) when compared with CPA. TwHF was associated with a lower risk of psychosis than prednisone; and there was less likelihood of hair loss when compared to CPA. The quality of evidence was poor; there were only 10 studies, enrolling a total of 630 patients; follow-up was short; the maximum number of studies included in a comparison was four; and we had major concerns over the quality of the included studies. TwHF may have an add-on effect on remission in patients with primary NS; however there is insufficient evidence to assess if TwHF is as effective as prednisone or CPA.
We wanted to find out if low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets were better for weight loss and heart disease risk factors than balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity.
We wanted to find this out for people with and without type 2 diabetes. We searched six electronic databases and trial registries for all trials* that compared low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets with balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. The trials had to last for at least three months. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
*A trial is a type of study in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. We found 61 trials involving 6925 people who were overweight or living with obesity. The biggest trial was in 419 people and the smallest was in 20 people. All except one of the trials were conducted in high-income countries worldwide, and nearly half were undertaken in the USA (26). Most trials (36) were undertaken in people who did not have heart disease or risk factors. Most people (5118 people) did not have type 2 diabetes. The average starting weight of people across the trials was 95 kg. Most studies (37) lasted for six months or less; and the longest studies (6) lasted for two years. Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in weight loss over the short term (trials lasting 3 to 8.5 months) and long term (trials lasting one to two years) compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets, in people with and without type 2 diabetes. In the short term, the average difference in weight loss was about 1 kg and in the long term, the average difference was less than 1 kg.
People lost weight on both diets in some trials. The amount of weight lost on average varied greatly with both diets across the trials from less than 1 kg in some trials and up to about 12 kg in others in the short term and long term.
Similarly, low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and LDL cholesterol (‘unhealthy’ cholesterol) for up to two years.
We could not draw any conclusions about unwanted effects reported by participants because very few trials reported these. We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some the trials were conducted, which included that many trials did not report all their results. Further research may change these results. The evidence is up-to-date to June 2021.
We included four studies involving 365 women. High or low feedback of prenatal ultrasound to reduce women's state of anxiety is not supported by evidence from the three randomised controlled trials, involving 346 pregnant women, that looked at this outcome (low-quality evidence). Two trials with a total of 148 women reported on the women's views on the level of feedback. The women in the high feedback groups were not clearly more likely to choose very positive adjectives to describe their feelings after the scan. One trial with 129 participants reported that women who had high feedback during ultrasound were more likely to stop smoking and avoid alcohol during pregnancy. The trials were reported on between 1985 and 1996.
The evidence for this review is current as of 1 October 2018. We included three trials that compared dilute formula milk (half-strength, double-volume) with full-strength formula milk. The trials involved 102 preterm or low birth weight infants; two were conducted in the USA and one in India. The trials were small (14, 38 and 50 infants, respectively) and conducted between 25 and 30 years ago. The quality of two trials was judged to be poor due to insufficient information being provided in the trial publications, but judged to be moderate in the third trial (of 38 infants). None of the trials assessed necrotising enterocolitis as an outcome. Infants receiving dilute formula (half-strength, double-volume) experienced fewer episodes of feeding intolerance and achieved full energy intake earlier than infants receiving full-strength formula (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)).
Feeding intolerance
Two measures of feeding intolerance (abdominal distension and episodes of gastric residuals) were reported across the trials. Two trials (88 infants) provided data for abdominal distension and gastric residuals. Infants fed dilute formula experienced 19% (CI 16% to 23%) fewer episodes of abdominal distension (> 2 cm), equivalent to 0.67 episodes per infant in the half-strength group compared to 0.83 episodes in the full-strength group. It was not possible to combine data on gastric residuals but both trials reported fewer episodes of gastric residuals in the dilute formula group. The third trial (14 infants) only reported that there was no difference between the groups with respect to these two outcomes.
Time to establish full enteral feeding
In two trials (88 infants) infants receiving dilute formula experienced a 22% (CI 16% to 28%) reduction in the number of days required to reach an adequate energy intake (420 joules/kilogram), equivalent to 8 days in the half-strength group compared to 10.3 days in the full-strength group. In exclusively formula-fed preterm or low birth weight infants, low-certainty evidence shows that diluted formula may lead to an important reduction in the time taken to attain adequate enteral fluid and energy requirements, without increasing indicators of feeding intolerance. The clinical importance of the reduction in episodes of feeding intolerance is unclear. These findings are based on three small, old trials that may be of less relevance to current practice. A lack of data on other important outcomes, such as the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and weight gain, limits the usefulness of the studies.
The evidence is current to January 2015, the review includes three trials. Two assessed the effectiveness of vaccinating women of reproductive age (9823 infants): one (1182 newborns) assessed the effects of tetanus toxoid against polyvalent influenza in preventing tetanus and deaths within the 30th day of life; the other (8641 newborns) assessed the effects of tetanus-diphtheria toxoid against cholera toxoid administered in women of reproductive age in preventing newborn deaths. The third trial (48 women and their newborns) assessed the safety of tetanus toxoid diphtheria acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) administration during pregnancy in comparison with placebo. A protective effect against deaths caused by tetanus was observed among the newborns from mothers who received at least two doses of the tetanus toxoid vaccine when compared with newborns from mothers who were immunised with influenza vaccine. A similar protective effect was seen with at least two doses of the tetanus vaccine against newborn deaths. Cases of tetanus were less frequent among newborns from women who received at least one dose of tetanus toxoid. This evidence was of moderate quality. In the second trial immunisation of women of reproductive age with tetanus diphtheria toxoid had a greater protective effect against newborn deaths than did cholera vaccine. The quality of the evidence was low for this outcome. In the third study no serious adverse events (during pregnancy or in babies) were related to the receiving of Tdap vaccine. The women experienced more pain with the vaccine injection than with the placebo. The available evidence supports the implementation of immunisation programs for women of reproductive age or pregnant women in communities with similar, or higher, levels of risk of tetanus in newborn babies as at the two study sites.
We wanted to find out whether transcutaneous bilirubin measurement devices could accurately diagnose hyperbilirubinaemia. We searched for studies that had investigated the accuracy of transcutaneous bilirubin measurement compared with total serum bilirubin measurement. We had intended to combine the results across studies using statistical methods but were unable to; instead, we presented the results narratively. We found 23 studies (5058 participants) that were conducted in different countries and settings, used different transcutaneous bilirubin measuring devices, and defined hyperbilirubinaemia with different bilirubin values. Some of the infants were premature and others were born at term (from 37 weeks' pregnancy); their ages ranged from birth to one month of life. Overall, the findings of the studies suggest that transcutaneous bilirubin measurement is a good screening tool for detecting hyperbilirubinaemia in newborns. The included studies found different degrees or levels of accuracy for the use of transcutaneous bilirubin measurement. However, due to the differences between studies, we could not provide an overall combined summary of the accuracy of the different tests. The differences in these studies included factors like the threshold values for hyperbilirubinaemia, the types of transcutaneous bilirubin measuring devices, and age and ethnicity/skin colour of the included infants. The included studies were of high methodological quality. However, we reported the results narratively and did not formally evaluate the quality of evidence using GRADE. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.
We found five studies. The searches were done in April 2014. Three studies were done in the USA, one study in the UK and one study in Japan. A total of 4786 people (9503 eyes) were included in these studies. Most participants had PDR. We found that moderate vision loss at 12 months was similar in eyes treated with laser and eyes that were not treated, but similar assessments made at a later date showed that eyes treated with laser were less likely to have suffered moderate vision loss. Treatment with laser reduced the risk of severe visual loss by over 50% at 12 months. There was a similar effect on the progression of DR. None of the studies reported patient-relevant outcomes such as pain or loss of driving licence. We did not find very many studies and those we found were done quite a long time ago when standards of trial conduct and reporting were lower. We judged the quality of the evidence to be low, with the exception of the results for severe visual loss, which we judged to be moderate quality evidence.
we included five small trials (482 preterm infants) which were all of reasonably strong design. There was one ongoing study. The search for trials is up-to-date as of 20 February 2020. preterm babies who received extra zinc by way of the stomach (a maximum of 10 mg per day either by mouth or through a feeding tube) while they were still in hospital probably die less often, probably put on weight and grew slightly better in length than those preterm babies who did not receive extra zinc. Extra zinc probably makes little to no difference to common problems in preterm babies such as chronic lung or eye problems, infection with bacteria or bowel problems. The trials which we included in this review did not have any information on the effect of extra zinc on the development later in life of the babies such as their ability to walk, their hearing or vision, language or their intelligence. We did not find indications of adverse effects of the extra zinc given to the babies. New and larger trials are needed to learn more about the effect on long-term development and growth when zinc is given by way of the stomach to babies born early. we assessed the evidence from the included trials on the effects of extra zinc in preterm babies as being of 'low- to moderate-certainty', because the trials were small, some had a few methodological weaknesses and the reported findings were inconsistent with each other for some of the outcomes. This means that further research through larger trials will likely provide important contributions to the existing knowledge and increase our confidence in the results.
One randomised controlled trial on the use of thalidomide for the treatment of active Crohn's disease (and ulcerative colitis) in children is in progress and should be completed in 2011. One randomised controlled trial using lenalidomide, a drug similar to thalidomide, was identified. This relatively small but well designed study did not demonstrate benefit for lenalidomide treatment of active Crohn's disease. Patients treated with high dose lenalidomide (25 mg/day) were more likely than patients receiving placebo (fake drug) to experience side effects. Side effects in the study included headache, rash and nausea. Known side effects of thalidomide include severe birth defects. The use of thalidomide or lenalidomide for the treatment of active Crohn's disease is not recommended.
The three randomized trials compared PCV versus VCV in a total of 1089 adults with ALI/ARDS from 43 ICUs in five high-income countries. None of the trials were industry-funded. The evidence is current to October 2014. We could not be sure whether the proportions of patients who died in hospital were very different between those treated with PCV and with VCV. For every 1000 persons treated with VCV, 636 deaths were reported. On the basis of our results, we could expect to see between 210 fewer deaths and 13 more deaths with PCV. We found that effects on mortality in the ICU and on mortality at 28 days were similarly uncertain. Our results include the possibility that VCV or PCV could be better for reducing the duration of ventilation or the development of traumatic lung damage caused by ventilation (barotrauma). None of the studies provided reliable information regarding to what extent failure of other organs would be impacted by the type of ventilation, nor did they provide information on differences in infection risk or quality of life following discharge from intensive care. The overall evidence for mortality was of moderate quality. For outcomes such as duration of ventilation, barotrauma and organ failure, evidence was limited by the small numbers studied, the different methods used in the studies or differences in reporting of results, which made interpretation difficult. Available evidence is insufficient to confirm whether PCV offers any advantage over VCV in improving outcomes for people with acute lung injury on ventilator machines. More studies including a larger number of people given PCV and VCV may provide reliable evidence on which more firm conclusions can be based.
We included 38 clinical trials (8915 women) which had tested the effects of endometrial injury on the outcomes of IVF. The studies were conducted in different populations of women, and the way the endometrial injury was conducted also differed between studies in terms of the instrument used and the timing of the procedure in relation to the IVF cycle. Many of the studies were poor quality and at high risk of bias, and therefore we performed the main analyses only including studies that were not at high risk of bias. Of the 38 included studies, only eight were included in the primary analyses. It is unclear whether endometrial injury affects the chance having a baby from IVF. The results suggest that, if the chance of having a baby from IVF is usually about 27%, then the chance of having a baby when using endometrial injury before IVF would be somewhere between less than 27% and 32%. Similarly, for the outcome of pregnancy, if the chance of getting pregnant from IVF is assumed to be about 32%, then the chance of pregnancy when using endometrial injury before IVF is somewhere between 31% and 37%.
Endometrial injury does not appear to affect the chance of having a miscarriage from IVF. The endometrial injury procedure causes mild to moderate pain and a small amount of vaginal bleeding, although this is short-lived. This evidence does not support the routine use of endometrial injury for women undergoing IVF.
One small study compared endometrial injury using two different instruments in the cycle prior to the IVF cycle. All outcomes reported for this study were graded as very-low certainty due to risk of bias, and as such we were not able to interpret the study results. For the primary analyses, the evidence is of moderate certainty. The evidence was reduced because the results were imprecise, and consistent with endometrial injury having no effect, being beneficial, and being harmful to the chance of getting pregnant or having a baby.
This review looked at the effect of cutting down the proportion of energy from fat in our food on body fatness in adults who are not aiming to lose weight. Body fatness was measured using body weight, body mass index, waist circumference and percent body fatness. The evidence is current to October 2019. The review found that cutting down on the proportion of fat in our food leads to a small but noticeable decrease in body weight, body mass index, percentage body fat and waist circumference. The effect did not change over time, but reducing fat intake to a greater extent results in greater weight reduction. We assessed potential harms of reducing total fat, but found no evidence of harm on serum lipids, blood pressure or quality of life.
The results of the previous review were not clear on how to handle blood glucose control during surgery in people with diabetes. Therefore, we have performed an update to obtain the most recent scientific evidence available on glucose management in people undergoing surgery. We identified eight new studies that add to the previous 12 included in the last review, so a total of 20 trials are now included in this review. All the trials evaluated intensive control of blood sugar. We included 1320 participants with diabetes randomised to perioperative intensive glucose control and 1350 participants with diabetes randomised to conventional or regular glucose control in our analyses. The trials were conducted on all continents. The mean duration of the intervention period varied from during surgery to five days. The mean age of the participants was 63 years. Despite lower blood sugar concentrations during the perioperative period, intensive glucose control may lead to little or no reduction in relevant postoperative outcomes such as risk of infection, kidney problems, and hospital and intensive care unit stay. Likewise, intensive glycaemic control results in little or no difference in all-cause mortality.
Compared with conventional glucose control, intensive glucose control may reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Intensive glucose control may slightly increase the risk of hypoglycaemia events, including serious ones. We have high confidence in the results for mortality, but our confidence is low or very low for the other results. This is because of limitations in the studies, and imprecise and inconsistent results. This evidence is current to 25 July 2022
We included nine studies involving 210 ear, nose and throat residents and medical students. Four studies compared virtual reality endoscopic sinus surgery training with conventional training; one study compared virtual reality endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy training versus textbook reading; two studies compared virtual reality temporal bone dissection training versus cadaveric temporal bone dissection training and two studies compared virtual reality temporal bone dissection training versus a small group tutorial with temporal bone models. None of the studies were funded by an agency with a commercial interest in the results of the studies. None of the studies evaluated whether training in virtual reality influences patient outcomes or non-technical skills. There is evidence to support the introduction of virtual reality into surgical training on the basis that the technical skills acquired by this method are as good as, or better than, those learnt through conventional training. Virtual reality can be added to the extensive range of activities that constitutes a comprehensive surgical training programme. Virtual reality simulation should also be considered as an additional learning tool for medical students. We assessed the quality of the evidence in this review for most outcomes as 'low' (using the GRADE system). The key reasons for this were issues related to study design. The evidence in this review is up to date to 27 July 2015.
This review looks at whether family therapy is an effective intervention in treating people of any age with depression. Family therapy for depression is widely used, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States. The small number of randomised controlled trials included in the review were very heterogeneous, and therefore difficult to synthesise. Family therapy seems more effective than no treatment or being placed on a waiting list, but it remains unclear how effective this intervention is in comparison to other interventions. Further randomised controlled trials are needed.
We identified one new study for this update. The three studies included a a total of 207 participants, which were women with breast cancer. The studies were small in size. We found no evidence of an effect for depression, stress, anxiety, fatigue, and body image. The findings of individual studies suggest that dance/movement therapy may have a beneficial effect on the quality of life, somatization (i.e. distress arising from perceptions of bodily dysfunction) and vigor of women with breast cancer. No adverse effects of dance/movement therapy interventions were reported. The evidence is based on only three small studies and the quality of the evidence is not strong. No conclusions could be drawn regarding the effect of dance/movement therapy on psychological and physical outcomes in cancer patients because of an insufficient number of studies. More research is needed. We did not identify any conflicts of interests in the included studies.
We searched for evidence (January 2017) and included two trials involving 4523 women and their babies. Both trials were conducted in Ireland and were at a moderate to high risk of bias. We could not combine the data from these trials because they looked at different interventions and comparisons. One compared ‘universal’ screening with ‘risk factor’-based screening for GDM. The other compared screening women at their general practitioners' clinic (primary care) versus at the hospital (secondary care).
In one trial (with information available for 3152 women), more women were diagnosed with GDM in the group of women who received ‘universal’ screening, compared with the group of women with ‘risk factor’-based screening (low-quality evidence). The trial did not report on outcomes relating to the mothers, including high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy, caesarean birth, perineal trauma, weight gain in pregnancy, postnatal depression, and type 2 diabetes. The trial did not report outcomes relating to the babies including being born large-for-gestational age, death (before or shortly after birth), death or a serious complication, hypoglycaemia, or adiposity, type 2 diabetes, and disability in childhood or adulthood.
In the second trial (with information available for 690 women), screening at the general practitioner's clinic versus the hospital did not make a clear difference to the number of women diagnosed with GDM (low-quality evidence), high blood pressure (l ow-quality evidence), pre-eclampsia (low-quality evidence), or the number who had a caesarean birth (l ow-quality evidence). This trial did not report perineal trauma, weight gain in pregnancy, postnatal depression, or type 2 diabetes. Screening at the general practitioner's clinic versus at the hospital did not make a clear difference to the number of babies born large-for-gestational age (low-quality evidence), death (before or shortly after birth), death or a serious complication (low-quality evidence), or hypoglycaemia (very low-quality evidence). Childhood or adulthood adiposity, type 2 diabetes, and disability were not reported in the trial. There is not enough evidence to guide us on effects of screening for GDM based on different risk profiles or settings on outcomes for women and their babies. Further large, well-designed, randomised controlled trials are required to assess important short- and long-term outcomes for mothers and their babies.
The review set out to compare studies where women receiving standard care were compared with women attending on a reduced number of occasions. We included seven randomised controlled trials involving more than 60,000 women. We assessed studies for risk of bias and graded the quality of the evidence. The trials were carried out in both high-income (four trials) and low- and middle-income countries (three trials). In high-income countries the number of visits was reduced to around eight. In lower-income countries many women in the reduced visits group attended for care on fewer than five occasions, although the content of visits was altered so as to focus on specific goals. In this review there was no strong evidence of differences between groups receiving a reduced number of antenatal visits compared with standard care on the number of preterm births or low birthweight babies (moderate-quality evidence). However, there was some evidence from these trials that in low- and middle-income countries perinatal mortality may be increased with reduced visits (low-quality evidence) although there may have been fewer admissions to neonatal intensive care but the evidence for this latter outcome was not strong. There was no clear difference between groups for our other primary outcomes including maternal death and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including pre-eclampsia). There was evidence that women in all settings were less satisfied with the reduced schedule of visits; for some women the gap between visits was perceived as too long. Reduced visits may be associated with lower costs.
We found only one high quality study of 55 babies that compared sodium bicarbonate treatment with no treatment. The study did not show any benefit of the use of this drug immediately after birth, nor any adverse effects.
This review of controlled clinical trials found that iron supplementation, which is generally well tolerated orally, may reduce the frequency and severity of breath-holding attacks, particularly if the child is anaemic. It is not known if this benefit is sustained after three months or if iron therapy should be continued until the child grows out of the breath-holding episodes.
To answer this question twelve studies of six to 14 months duration involving 350 people were analysed. Thyroid hormone therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism did not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity (for example less heart attacks or strokes). Data on health-related quality of life and symptoms did not demonstrate significant differences between placebo and thyroid hormone therapy. Some evidence indicated that thyroid hormone had some effects on blood lipids and technical measurements of heart function. Adverse effects were inadequately addressed in most of the included studies and have to be urgently investigated in future studies, especially in older patients.
Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 27 February 2018. We included 38 studies and a total of 1042 infrabony defects. We considered four different types of surgical treatments and compared each technique with the same one when APC was added. Overall we considered these comparisons: open flap debridement with APC versus without APC; open flap debridement and bone graft with APC versus without APC; guided tissue regeneration with APC versus without APC; and enamel matrix derivative with APC versus without APC. There is very low-quality evidence that the addition of APC to two types of treatment: open flap debridement and open flap debridement with bone graft, may bring some advantages in the treatment of infrabony defects. However, for the other two types of treatment, guided tissue regeneration and enamel matrix derivative, there is insufficient evidence of a benefit. We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to problems with the design of the studies.
 Key results
Results suggest that oral dextrose gel probably corrects individual episodes of low blood glucose levels and may result in a slight reduction in the risk of major disability at age two years or older; however, the evidence is uncertain. The evidence was not sufficient to show whether oral dextrose gel reduces the need for other treatments. Oral dextrose gel compared to placebo gel probably reduces mother-infant separation and probably increases the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding after discharge from the hospital. Researchers reported no adverse events when oral dextrose gel was given to infants.
We searched for studies up to October 2021.There are two ongoing studies that may alter the conclusions of this review when published. The available studies were small in size and there are not enough studies and to be entirely certain about the results.
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure following abdominal surgery. The trials compared NPPV with usual care(oxygen therapy through a face mask). We included two trials involving 269 participants.The participants were mostly men (67%) and on average 65 years of age. One trial was conducted in several intensive care units (ICU). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to May 2015. This review examined mortality, rate of tracheal intubation, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications after NPPV, and changes in the levels of gases within the blood (arterial blood gases).
Compared with oxygen therapy, NPPV decreased the rate of tracheal intubation. Out of every 1000 adults who developed acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, 181 adults treated with oxygen therapy would need to be intubated compared with 54 adults treated with NPPV.
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV tended to reduce mortality. However, since the number of participants included in the two trials was small, more studies are needed.
The use of NPPV also reduced the length of stay in the ICU by almost two days when compared to oxygen therapy. However, the mean length of stay in the hospital was similar in the two groups.
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV improved blood gas levels one hour after the intervention.
There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic (e.g. where two pieces of intestine are joined together) leakage, pneumonia related complications and sepsis (blood poisoning) or infections. However, adults treated with NPPV had lower rates these complications than adults treated with oxygen. There was low quality evidence for hospital mortality, low quality of evidence for rate of tracheal intubation, and very low quality of evidence for ICU length of stay. The findings of this review showed that NPPV is an effective and safe treatment for adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, due to the low quality of the evidence, more good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.
We found 32 studies that tested the effects of increased police patrols on traffic deaths, injuries, and crashes. There was one randomized controlled trial and no quasi-randomized controlled trials. Almost all of the programs included additional interventions like community information programs, media campaigns, and special training for police officers. Most studies found that increased police patrols reduced traffic crashes and fatalities. Evidence for the effect on traffic injuries was less consistent. The detail provided on the methodology of included studies was almost uniformly poor. When this information was reported, the methodological quality was often weak. Therefore, the available evidence does not firmly establish that increased police patrols reduce the adverse consequences of alcohol-impaired driving. Good quality controlled studies with adequate sample size are needed to evaluate increased patrols. Also needed are studies assessing the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.
We searched the medical literature widely for randomised controlled trials that investigated the effects of progesterone in people with TBI up to 30 September 2016. Randomised controlled trials provide the most robust medical evidence. . We included five studies with a total of 2392 participants, and identified three ongoing studies. The studies all compared a group of participants who received progesterone within 24 hours of TBI against a group who received a pretend - or dummy - medicine (known as a placebo) that looked the same as the progesterone.
The results of our review did not find evidence that, when compared to placebo, progesterone could reduce death and disability in people with TBI. There were too few data available on the other outcomes that we were interested in (pressure inside the skull (intracranial pressure), blood pressure, body temperature and adverse events (harms)), for us to be able to analyse these in detail. However, although the information available shows no evidence of a difference in effect between the progesterone and control groups for intracranial pressure, blood pressure or body temperature, one study showed an increased level of an adverse event called phlebitis (inflammation in the vein) in the progesterone group, possibly because the progestreone was given into the vein through an intravascular infusion ('drip'). We judged the quality of the evidence to be low for the data on risk of death, and moderate for the data on risk of disability. These judgements resulted from differences across studies, including different doses of progesterone and different time points for assessment of participants in the included studies. This means that we have limited confidence in the conclusions of this review.
This review of 16 trials, involving 3361 patients, has found that the outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage, in terms of survival and being independent in activities of daily living, is improved by treatment with calcium channel blockers (antagonists). If the largest trial is excluded from the analysis, the results are no longer statistically significant, and therefore the evidence is not beyond all doubt. However, given the high likelihood of benefits and the modest risks associated with this treatment, the review authors conclude that calcium antagonists, in the form of oral nimodipine 60 mg every four hours, are useful in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Magnesium is another calcium antagonist with promising results, but larger trials with this drug are needed before we can be certain about a beneficial effect.
We included one trial with 269 participants who were followed up for 24 months. We assessed data to identify differences in blood pressure, number of deaths and serious diseases between a group of people receiving psychological assistance to reduce alcohol intake and people not receiving this assistance. Based on this limited information, although those participants who received psychological assistance were able to reduce their alcohol intake more than those without such assistance, we found no differences in the number of deaths, total heart problems and total vascular problems between people receiving psychological assistance to decrease alcohol intake and those not receiving such help. We also found no differences in blood pressure reduction. Data on quality of life or serious adverse effects were not available. We found only one relevant study to answer our question. The certainty of evidence from this single included study was evaluated as being low to very low. More long-term trials need to be conducted to assess the effect of reduction in alcohol intake on blood pressure.
We searched the literature to August 2015 and included nine studies that analysed 634 participants; durations of studies ranged from 4 and 24 weeks. The interventions included calcium-enriched bread, low phosphorus intake, low protein intake, very low protein intake, post-haemodialysis supplements and low lipid diet. Only one study reported death; none of the included studies reported cardiovascular events or fractures. One study reported adverse events. There was insufficient reporting of design and methodological aspects among the included studies to enable robust assessment of risk of bias.
We found scant evidence to suggest that restricting protein or phosphorus in the diet may have positive effects for people with CKD. Evidence from one small, low quality study suggested that calcium-enriched bread may help to increase calcium and decrease phosphorus and the calcium × phosphate product.
Evidence was assessed as low quality, and was insufficient to inform clinical decision-making about the value of dietary modification for people with CKD-MBD. None of the included studies reported our primary outcomes of cardiovascular events or fracture; only one study reported adverse events.
We included two trials (144 total participants) in this review. Participants included men and women, most of whom were older than 50 years, who had good visual acuity. Participants were either susceptible to or had been diagnosed with an early stage of AMD. Both trials compared simvastatin with placebo. The larger trial, with 114 participants and conducted in Australia, used a higher dose of 40 mg per day and had a treatment period of three years. The smaller trial, with 30 participants and conducted in Italy, used a lower dose of 20 mg per day and had a treatment period of three months. The evidence provided in this review was up-to-date as of March 2016. Neither trial provided sufficient evidence to determine whether statins are effective in delaying the onset or progression of AMD. Information was lacking for outcomes related to vision, quality of life, and adverse events. The overall quality of the evidence was low. In the smaller trial, the number of participants enrolled and the short treatment period may not have been sufficient for detecting the effect of statins on AMD, which develops over time. In the larger trial, 30% of participants did not attend the three-year follow-up visit, and the amount of missing data hindered our ability to draw any reliable conclusions for this trial.
Twenty-two trials randomised approximately 6200 people to pioglitazone treatment. The longest duration of pioglitazone therapy was 34.5 months. Unfortunately, the published studies of at least 24 weeks pioglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide convincing evidence that patient-oriented outcomes are positively influenced by this compound. The occurrence of oedema was significantly raised. The results of the single trial with relevant endpoints (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial In Macrovascular Events - PROactive study) have to be confirmed by other independent investigations. Until new evidence becomes available (several large trials are ongoing) the place of pioglitazone in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus remains unclear. 
Furthermore, confusion arises due to different labelling of pioglitazone, for example in Europe and the USA. Consumers and physicians need clear guidance and transparent information about which studies exactly are used for the decisions of the relevant drug authorities.
This review of 16 trials in 34,369 non-surgical patients who suffered an acute medical illness found that heparin reduced the number of patients suffering DVTs but also increased the risk of bleeding complications when compared to participants that received a placebo or no medication. We had some concerns over how reliable the results were from the unblinded studies, which made up just under half of the studies. Also, most of the studies were lacking explanations of how the allocation of the treatments was performed. The lower risk of PEs (when combining those that caused death and those that did not) with heparin could have been a chance effect. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the rate of death or thrombocytopaenia. The review also found that patients who were given LMWH developed fewer DVTs and fewer bleeding complications compared with those given UFH, leading to the conclusion that LMWH is more effective and carries a lower risk of adverse events in preventing blood clots than with UFH. There was no clear evidence of differences between LMWH and UFH for PE, death or thrombocytopaenia.
Cochrane Schizophrenia's Information Specialist ran an electronic search in January 2016, searching their specialised register for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either chlorpromazine or clotiapine. The search identified six reports. We inspected these reports and found four trials, published between 1974 and 2003, randomising 276 participants that could be included in the review. The four included trials were poorly conducted and did not report data for clinically important change in global or mental state, or cost of care. Improvement in overall mental state was reported and participants receiving clotiapine had better improvement scores than those receiving chlorpromazine. However the trials also reported data for improvement in the negative symptoms, no difference between the two treatments was found. Clotiapine did not cause more movement disorders than chlorpromazine, and similar numbers of participants left the trials early. There is some very low-quality evidence that favours clotiapine over chlorpromazine for improving overall mental state. For other outcomes, including adverse effects, there is no evidence of a difference between these two antipsychotics. However these data are very difficult to draw conclusions from, only four small trials provided data and these were poorly conducted. We cannot draw conclusions on the comparative effectiveness of chlorpromazine versus clotiapine from such data.
This review is an update of one last published in 2015. We wanted to know whether exercise improves pain, physical function, and quality of life for people with knee osteoarthritis. We searched for studies of adults with knee osteoarthritis that assessed the effects of land-based exercise on pain, physical function, and quality of life. The studies had to compare a group of people doing exercise to a group who received attention or a placebo (fake) intervention, or to a group receiving no treatment, usual care, or limited education. We also included studies comparing exercise plus another intervention versus that intervention on its own.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and consistency of results. We found 139 studies with a total of 12,468 people. Study participants were, on average, aged between 41 and 81 years. Exercise programs lasted between 2 and 104 weeks. Outcomes were measured right after the end of the exercise program, with some studies also collecting outcomes in the weeks and months after the end of the program.
Thirty trials (22%) compared exercise to attention control or placebo. Sixty trials (43%) compared exercise to no treatment, usual care, or limited education. Forty-nine trials (35%) added exercise to another type of treatment and compared that to the other treatment on its own. To determine whether benefits would make a meaningful difference to someone with knee osteoarthritis, we compared our findings to established 'minimal important difference' scores for pain (12 points on a 0 to 100 point scale), physical function (13 points), and quality of life (15 points).
Exercise compared with attention control or placebo
- Exercise may result in a slight improvement in pain (8.7 points better on a 0 to 100 point scale).
- Exercise likely results in an improvement in physical function (11.3 points better on a 0 to 100 point scale).
- Exercise likely results in little to no improvement in quality of life (6.1 points better on a 0 to 100 point scale).
In terms of adverse events at final follow-up, we found that exercise may not increase adverse events.
Exercise compared with no treatment, usual care, or limited education
- Exercise may result in an improvement in pain (13.1 points better on a 0 to 100 point scale).
- Exercise likely results in an improvement in physical function (12.5 points better on a 0 to 100 point scale).
- Exercise likely results in a slight improvement in quality of life (5.4 points better on a 0 to 100 point scale).
In terms of adverse events at final follow-up, we found that exercise may increase adverse events.
Exercise added to another treatment compared to the other treatment alone
- Exercise likely results in an improvement in pain (10.4 points better on a 0 to 100 point scale).
- Exercise likely results in a slight improvement in physical function (9.7 points better on a 0 to 100 point scale).
- Exercise likely results in a slight improvement in quality of life (4.2 points better on a 0 to 100 point scale).
In terms of adverse events at final follow-up, we found that exercise likely increases adverse events slightly. We have low to moderate confidence in our results. Many studies are of poor quality with small sample sizes. Therefore, some studies may have made the benefits of exercise seem greater than they are. We searched for studies up to 4 January 2024.
The quality of the evidence is limited by small sizes of the groups being studied, significant risk of bias, and incomplete data on important outcome measures, as well as by the lack of an English translation of the full-text manuscript of one study. Further high-quality research is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of sulthiame as a single treatment in epilepsy.
The evidence is current to April 2020.
Exercise is moderately more effective than no therapy for reducing symptoms of depression.
Exercise is no more effective than antidepressants for reducing symptoms of depression, although this conclusion is based on a small number of studies. 
Exercise is no more effective than psychological therapies for reducing symptoms of depression, although this conclusion is based on small number of studies.
The reviewers also note that when only high-quality studies were included, the difference between exercise and no therapy is less conclusive.
Attendance rates for exercise treatments ranged from 50% to 100%.
The evidence about whether exercise for depression improves quality of life is inconclusive. The reviewers recommend that future research should look in more detail at what types of exercise could most benefit people with depression, and the number and duration of sessions which are of most benefit. Further larger trials are needed to find out whether exercise is as effective as antidepressants or psychological treatments.
Ankle-foot orthoses are devices that can be provided to improve walking in people with neuromuscular disorders. There are many different types of ankle-foot orthoses and their effects on walking vary considerably. To help healthcare professionals and patients make informed decisions about the use of ankle-foot orthoses, we wanted to review the available evidence about their effects on walking. We searched the medical literature for all relevant studies that compared walking with ankle-foot orthoses to walking only with shoes. We then compared the results, summarised the evidence, and assessed our confidence in the evidence. To do this, we considered the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. We found 10 relevant studies with 186 participants in total. Overall, the results suggest that the use of ankle-foot orthoses made from carbon may reduce walking effort (measured objectively), increase walking speed, and enhance satisfaction while walking. Leather AFOs may increase walking speed. We are unable to draw conclusions about perceived walking effort and balance with AFOs compared to shoes, and about the use of AFOs, as the evidence is very uncertain. We are unable to draw conclusions about adverse events due to AFO interventions in comparison with no intervention. The certainty of all evidence for the effects found was either very low or low. Currently, the evidence for using ankle-foot orthoses to improve walking in people with calf muscle weakness is limited. Large prospective studies of high quality are needed to address this knowledge gap. The variety in the effects found for AFOs of different materials warrants further investigation. Future studies could examine the effect of AFO material on the improvement of walking in people with calf muscle weakness due to slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders. Four of the included studies that assessed the effects of AFOs had a randomised cross-over design; the other six studies were not randomised. Outcomes were assessed at different time points, and most studies did not include follow-up assessments. The ankle-foot orthosis types that were examined varied in their design and material. Most ankle-foot-orthosis types, in particular the ankle-foot orthoses that were made of carbon, were custom-made; the remainder were prefabricated. These factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. We searched for studies published up to February 2023.
We included studies with children (younger than 18 years of age) suffering from acute severe pain as a result of injury or medical illness. The target intervention was INF administered for pain relief compared with any other drug intervention for pain relief (e.g. intravenous morphine) or non-drug intervention (e.g. limb splinting, wound dressing) provided in the emergency setting. The evidence is current to January 2014. We identified three studies that included 313 children with acute severe pain resulting from broken bones of the upper and lower limbs. These trials compared INF versus morphine administered by a needle into a muscle (intramuscular morphine) or via a drip into a vein (intravenous morphine), as well as standard concentration INF versus high concentration INF. The collective study population in these trials consisted of children three to 15 years of age. Males accounted for approximately two-thirds of the overall study population. The review concluded that INF may be an effective analgesic for the treatment of children in acute moderate to severe pain, and its administration appears to cause minimal distress to children; however, the evidence is insufficient to permit judgement of the effects of INF compared with intramuscular or intravenous morphine. No serious adverse events (e.g. opiate toxicity, death) were reported. Limitations of this review include the following: Few studies (three) were eligible for inclusion; no study examined the use of INF in children younger than three years of age; no study included children with pain resulting from a "medical" cause (e.g. abdominal pain seen in appendicitis); and all eligible studies were conducted in Australia. Consequently, the findings may not be generalizable to other healthcare settings, to children younger than three years of age and to those with pain from a "medical" cause.
In this review of two randomised trials involving 3477 participants, we found that cilostazol was more effective for the prevention of stroke, heart attack and death from vascular causes in Asian patients with stroke. In terms of safety, it causes more side effects than aspirin but less serious bleeding in the brain and the body.
We included one trial with 117 children with SCD aged between six months and four years. This was a one-year doubIe-blind (both participants and doctors did not know which treatment group the participants were allocated to) controlled triaI comparing children taking folic acid supplements to those taking a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). The trial investigators reported that folic acid supplementation led to higher levels of folic acid measured in the blood. However, there were no differences in haemoglobin concentrations at the end of one year.
The trial also reported on clinical factors linked to treatment, including growth, major and minor infections, acute splenic sequestration, episodes of bone or abdominal pains. The investigators reported no differences in these outcomes from baseline to the end of the trial; however, the trial was not large enough to detect any possible differences reported between the folic acid group and the placebo group. In the included trial it was not clear how participants were allocated to receive folic acid or placebo. The method of making sure that participants and trial staff did not know what treatment each person was receiving (called allocation concealment) was also not described. These two factors mean that the trial had a high risk of biased results.
The trial did not contain many participants. For many of its clinical endpoints, it was not designed to show differences between people taking folic acid and those taking a placebo. This means that the results from this trial are imprecise, and therefore hard to interpret.
Finally, our review was meant to investigate folate supplementation (folate occurring naturally in foods, provided as fortified foods or additional supplements such as tablets) in children and adults. Because we only identified one trial that investigated one form of supplementation in children, the results are not useful for other populations.
Therefore, we judged the evidence from the included trial to be of low quality. Based on just one low quality study with evidence only to show that folate supplementation raises the blood levels of folic acid, we cannot state whether this treatment is effective or not.
More trials with more people and longer treatment duration (and follow-up) of folate supplementation in people with SCD are needed to strengthen this review; however, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated.
We did not find any relevant studies to include in the review, but we found two studies which we might be able to include in an update of this review when we have more information about them and they have both been completed. When we ran our searches, we did not find any studies that matched our inclusion criteria. This means we cannot comment on how CGMS affects the outcomes we set out to investigate as there is no evidence for us to look at. We found one ongoing study in people with CFRD who are in hospital for a pulmonary exacerbation (flare up of chest symptoms). The study is comparing the effects of giving insulin via an insulin pump and monitoring blood sugar using a CGMS to giving daily insulin injections (or if participants are already using an insulin pump before being admitted to hospital, they continue with this) and monitoring blood sugar levels using the 'finger stick' method. The people using the finger stick method will wear a dummy CGMS so the clinicians measuring outcomes will not know which group they are in. The study has not yet been completed, so we could not include it, but we might be able to include it in a future version of this review.
More research is needed on this topic to help fill the gap in the evidence which we have identified in this review.
We identified four trials that included 758 participants. We excluded studies in which the participants had complications. Two of the four included studies in this review were small and the quality of the evidence was low to moderate. We do not know if acetaminophen is effective for reducing common cold symptoms or its adverse effects. We cannot either 'recommend' or 'not recommend' its use in common practice because we do not have enough well-designed trials to reach a conclusion. There is a need for more high-quality studies to determine the effectiveness of acetaminophen in relieving common cold symptoms.
The evidence is current to January 2017. We included 64 studies related to six different types of drugs recommended for HAI prevention. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. The participants' ages ranged between 16 and 65 years. Eleven studies included people at a high risk of this condition due to their history of HAI or other illnesses such as asthma. Twenty-four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. In 23 of the included studies, the source of funding was unclear. Only 18 studies declared their possible conflicts of interests. We classed 24 more studies as still ongoing or waiting for assessment. Our findings suggest that acetazolamide is an effective treatment for the prevention of acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day, when this drug is compared to a placebo (i.e. a pill with no active agent). Most of the available information relates to the prevention of uncomplicated HAI (headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness) rather than to more serious brain or lung problems. We also found that acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia in the fingers (i.e. a sensation of tingling, tickling, pricking, or burning of the skin), although this outcome is not well reported in the available evidence. The benefits and harms of other drugs such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear, due to the small number of studies. We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate to very low. Several studies had quality shortcomings, including their use of small numbers of participants and a lack of reporting of important outcomes such as side effects. For most of the drugs covered by the studies, additional research is required to clarify their effectiveness and safety.
We found 15 studies involving 1731 women that contributed data to the analyses. Studies were undertaken across the world, including countries in Europe and Scandinavia, and Iran, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and USA.
We found that relaxation techniques, yoga and music may help women manage labour pain, although the quality of the evidence varied between low and very low, and more data are needed. Also, in these trials there were variations in how these techniques were used. There was no clear evidence that these therapies had an impact on assisted vaginal or caesarean birth. There were insufficient data to say if these techniques influenced the baby’s condition at birth. The use of some relaxation therapies, yoga, or music may possibly be helpful with reducing the intensity of pain, and in helping women feel more in control and satisfied with their labours. However, the wide variations in types of techniques used in these studies make it difficult to say specifically what might help women. Therefore further research studies are needed.
We included 19 studies with 2385 participants with CS or LCOS complicating myocardial infarction, heart failure or cardiac surgery. The follow-up periods of the studies varied between the length of the recovery period and a period of up to 12 months. Eight studies were funded by the manufacturer of the investigated drug. In one study, the relationship to the pharmaceutical industry was not determined. We compared different strategies employing inotropic or vasodilating drugs (i.e. levosimendan, enoximone, piroximone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopexamine, milrinone, dopamine and dobutamine). Low-quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding short- and long-term mortality in the comparison of levosimendan with dobutamine. Very low-quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding long-term mortality in the comparison of levosimendan with placebo; no data were available for the short-term follow-up. Very low-quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding short-term mortality in the comparison of levosimendan with enoximone, epinephrine with norepinephrine-dobutamine, dopexamine with dopamine, enoximone with dobutamine, and dopamine-milrinone with dopamine-dobutamine; no data were available for the long-term follow-up. Very low-quality evidence reflects uncertainty for all-cause mortality in the short and long term when comparing epinephrine with norepinephrine. No data on all-cause mortality were available in the comparison of milrinone with dobutamine, enoximone with piroximone and enoximone with epinephrine-nitroglycerine. This evidence is current to October 2019. We have very little confidence in the results of the studies that we analysed (low- or very low-quality evidence) due to relevant study limitations (risk of bias), imprecision or indirectness.
This review included eight randomised controlled trials of autoinflation for glue ear. All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up.
The review authors used a combined outcome measure which included any outcome signifying improvement (as defined in the individual studies) and measured outcomes at the time points 'up to one month' and 'more than one month'. Improvement was demonstrated only in 'more than one month' analyses. Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device at both under one month and over one month. None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions.
The authors conclude that the evidence for the use of autoinflation in the short term appears favourable. Given the small number of studies and the lack of long-term follow-up, the long-term effects associated with the use of these devices cannot be determined.
We found 13 studies, including 313 people with type 1 or 2 diabetes. We found that reducing salt intake by an average of 5 g/day lowered BP, with systolic BP reduced by 7 mm of mercury (Hg) and diastolic BP reduced by 3 mm Hg. We found that the amount of protein in the urine was reduced in four of the eight studies that reported this outcome. Only one study reported side effects with low BP when standing up with low salt diets reported in a quarter of the participants. Lowering dietary salt intake to the recommended levels of 5 g/day or less would benefit people with diabetes by lowering BP by similar amounts to a single BP medication.
Studies conducted more than 20 years ago suggested that physostigmine could improve memory in people with or without dementia. Investigation of this property has been limited by the very short half-life of physostigmine. Various forms of administering the drug have been tried to overcome this problem, most recently a controlled-release (CR) oral formulation, and a skin patch. An additional limiting factor has been a high incidence of adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Physostigmine appears to have no advantage over some newer anticholinesterase drugs. The short half-life remains a serious disadvantage and requires complex forms of administration. There is no reason to recommend further research into this drug.
The review clearly showed evidence that people treated for chronic heart failure for three months or more with phosphodiesterase III inhibitors were more likely to die than people given an inactive placebo treatment.
We included 14 controlled trials involving 805 critically ill participants on mechanical ventilation. All participants were alert. Slightly more patients (58%) included in these studies were male and their average age was 58 years.
The majority of the studies examined the effects of patients listening to pre-recorded music. Most studies offered one 20 to 30-minute music session to the participants. The findings suggest that music listening may have a large anxiety-reducing effect on mechanically ventilated patients. The results furthermore suggest that music listening consistently reduces respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure, suggesting a relaxation response. No evidence of effect was found for diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, or oxygen saturation level and inconsistent results were found for heart rate and hormone levels. One large-scale study reported greater reductions in the intake of sedative and analgesic medications in the music listening group compared to the control group, and two other studies reported similar trends.
Music listening did not result in any harm. Most trials presented some methodological weakness. Therefore, these results need to be interpreted with caution. However, the results are consistent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music interventions for anxiety reduction in medical patients. Therefore, we conclude that music interventions may provide a viable anxiety management option to mechanically ventilated patients.
The authors found three studies involving 70 adult burn patients. The results of the studies provide no conclusive evidence for the benefit of early enteral nutritional support compared to delayed support, on outcomes such as length of hospital stay and mortality.
The trials involved a small number of participants and were limited by methodological weaknesses. There is a need for larger, high quality research into the use of early versus delayed feeding in burn patients.
Overall, the authors conclude that there is currently little evidence to support the use of early nutritional support, but more trials are needed.
Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a set of symptoms experienced when one reduces or stops alcohol consumption after prolonged periods of alcohol intake. Some studies show that AWS coincides with low levels of magnesium in the blood. Since magnesium may play a role in dampening the excitability of the central nervous system, some researchers believe that low levels of magnesium may make the central nervous system 'hyper-excitable' and may cause AWS symptoms, which include sleeplessness, tremors, anxiety, headache, excessive sweating and reduced appetite. Many AWS treatment protocols therefore recommend magnesium supplementation.
The goal of our review was to determine whether magnesium supplementation prevents or treats AWS in adults. Our review of four trials covering 317 participants determined that there is not enough evidence about the benefits or harms of using magnesium supplements to prevent or treat AWS in adults.
We found 15 randomised controlled trials (a type of experiment in which people are randomly allocated to one or more treatment groups) that compared the use of vasodilators versus placebo or no treatment in a total of 1326 women undergoing fertility treatment. The evidence is current to October 2017. Only three of the included studies reported live birth rates. Overall, vasodilators probably make little or no difference in rates of live birth. Moderate-quality evidence shows that vasodilators probably increase overall rates of side effects (including headache and tachycardia (faster than normal heartbeat)) in comparison with placebo or no treatment. However, low-quality evidence suggests that vasodilators may increase the chance of becoming pregnant. The evidence is of low to moderate quality. More research is needed (one study is ongoing and will be incorporated into this review in a subsequent update).
Two trials were included this review. One trial (considered to be at a high risk of bias) evaluated the impact of Hib vaccination during pregnancy and the other trial (judged to be at a low risk of bias) evaluated the impact of viral influenza vaccination during pregnancy.
In one small study (involving 213 women, mainly Hispanic and with low income, and 213 neonates, conducted in the US), women were given either Hib vaccination or a placebo control at between 34 to 36 weeks gestation. This trial did not report on any of this review's primary outcomes, including: mortality, respiratory tract infection or sepsis among the women or their babies. Nor did the study report on any of this review's other secondary outcomes apart from preterm birth and there were no clear differences between the vaccination and placebo groups.
In one large trial (involving 2116 women and 2049 infants, conducted in Soweto, South Africa) pregnant women received either inactivated viral influenza vaccination or a placebo control. Viral influenza vaccination was associated with a reduction in confirmed influenza among women and their babies. However, there was no clear difference between groups in terms of pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, preterm labour and stillbirth), influenza-like illness in women or their babies (high quality evidence), any respiratory illness, hospitalisation for respiratory infections and deaths among women (moderate quality evidence ) and their babies (moderate quality evidence ), neonatal hospitalisation for sepsis (moderate quality evidence ), or maternal hospitalisation for any infection (moderate quality evidence). Similarly, there was no clear difference in any adverse systemic reactions between the vaccine and placebo groups. Evidence from one large high quality trial on the effectiveness of viral influenza vaccine during pregnancy suggests reduced reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) ) confirmed influenza among women and their babies, suggesting the potential of this strategy for scale up but further evidence from varying contexts is required.
Further trials for both Hib and viral influenza vaccines with appropriate study designs and suitable comparison groups are required.
There are currently two ongoing studies - these will be incorporated into this review in future updates.
This review identified all randomised or quasi-randomised trials of Ginkgo biloba extract in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. There was no convincing evidence, from trials of sufficient methodological quality, to support the routine use of Ginkgo biloba extract to promote recovery after stroke. High-quality and large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed to test its efficacy.
Antibiotics can be used individually, or combined, and administered for different durations. To identify the best antibiotic(s), or dose pattern, for preventing development of MRSA infection after surgery, we investigated studies that compared different antibiotics with each other, or with no treatment, to prevent MRSA SSIs. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and set no limits regarding language, or date, of publication, or trial size. Two review authors identified studies and extracted data independently.
We identified 12 RCTs, with 4704 participants. Eleven trials compared 16 preventative (prophylactic) antibiotic treatments, and one compared antibiotic prophylaxis with no prophylaxis. Generally, MRSA status of the participants prior to surgery was not known.
Four studies reported deaths (14/1401 participants): approximately 1% of participants died from any cause after surgery, but there were no significant differences between treatment groups. Four trials reported on serious antibiotic-related adverse events - there were none in 561 participants. None of the trials reported quality of life, length of hospital stay or use of healthcare resources. Overall, 221 SSIs due to any bacterium developed in 4032 people (6%), and 46 MRSA SSIs developed in 4704 people (1%). There were no significant differences in development of SSIs between the 15 comparisons of one antibiotic treatment against another. When antibiotic prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav was compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis, a significantly lower proportion of people developed SSIs after receiving co-amoxiclav (74% reduction in all SSIs, and 95% reduction in MRSA SSIs).
Two trials reported that 19 participants developed MRSA infection in wounds (SSIs), chest, or bloodstream, but there were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed them between the two comparisons.
Prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav decreases the proportion of people developing MRSA infections compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis in people without cancer undergoing surgery for feeding tube insertion into the stomach using endoscopy, although this may be due to decreasing overall infection thereby preventing wounds from becoming secondarily infected with MRSA. There is currently no other evidence that either a combination of prophylactic antibiotics, or increased duration of antibiotic treatment, benefits people undergoing surgery in terms of reducing MRSA infections. Well-designed RCTs are necessary to assess different antibiotic treatments for preventing MRSA infections after surgery.
We wanted to find out whether psychedelic-assisted therapy was better than active-placebo-assisted therapy to improve anxiety, depression, and existential distress. We also wanted to find out whether psychedelic-assisted therapy was linked with any unwanted effects or risk of harm. Our aim was to systematically collect and evaluate available evidence for psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat anxiety, depression, and existential distress. We searched for high quality clinical studies. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods. We found six studies testing psychedelic-assisted therapy using psilocybin (3 studies), LSD (2 studies), and MDMA (1 study). The studies involved 149 adults with anxiety, depression, or existential distress. The largest study tested psilocybin in 56 people and the two smallest studies tested psilocybin or LSD in 12 people. The studies took place in the USA and Switzerland. Most studies had a follow-up of 6 to 12 months. Drug companies were not involved in study funding, but funding was provided by organisations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy.
Psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) compared to an active placebo (e.g. a very low dose of the same drug) may reduce anxiety and depression. However, our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; we may find that the true effect is substantially different when more studies are conducted. Psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics may reduce existential distress, but the evidence is mixed and very uncertain. For psychedelic-assisted therapy with MDMA, the data on anxiety or depression is inconclusive, and existential distress was not investigated.
Psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) compared to an active placebo may improve quality of life and induce spiritually significant experiences, but the evidence is very uncertain. For MDMA-assisted therapy, quality of life did not improve, but the evidence is very uncertain. Spirituality outcomes were not assessed for MDMA.
Psychedelic-assisted therapy seems to be well tolerated, but evidence about side effects is very uncertain. The studies reported no serious side effects. The classical psychedelic studies reported mild to moderate side effects such as nausea, anxiety, dry mouth, psychotic-like symptoms (e.g. pseudo-hallucination, where people know that they are hallucinating), and high blood pressure, which subsided when the drug effects wore off or the following day. The MDMA study reported anxiety, dry mouth, jaw clenching, and headaches, which subsided when the drug effects wore off or within the following week. There were several limitations to the evidence. Importantly, participants were often aware of the treatment they were receiving, which may influence their results. In addition, the studies were small. It is important to note that future studies might change the conclusions of this review. As the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) currently classifies psychedelics as Schedule I substances (i.e. having no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse), research involving these drugs is restricted, but is steadily increasing. This review is based on a search for evidence up to March 2024.
This review of trials found only four studies which had an overall low quality. Three trials showed no significant differences between momordica charantia and placebo or antidiabetic drugs (glibenclamide and metformin) in the blood sugar response. The duration of treatment ranged from four weeks to three months, and altogether 479 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated. No trial investigated death from any cause, morbidity, health-related quality of life or costs. Adverse effects were mostly moderate, including diarrhoea and abdominal pain. However, reporting of adverse effects was incomplete in the included studies. There are many varieties of preparations of momordica charantia, as well as variations in its use as a vegetable. Further studies are needed to assess the quality of the various momordica charantia preparations as well as to further evaluate its use in the diet of diabetic people.
The purpose of this review was to assess the evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions for improving ankle flexibility in people with neuromuscular disease. Four studies were included in the review involving a total of 149 participants. Two studies showed that wearing a night splint was no more effective than not wearing a night splint for increasing ankle flexibility in 26 people who had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. One study showed corticosteroids (prednisone) did not significantly improve ankle flexibility in 103 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the other study showed that while orthopaedic surgery initially increased ankle flexibility in 20 young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy this was not sustained in the long term. This review shows that, currently, there is limited evidence supporting any intervention for improving ankle flexibility in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. More research is needed.
We assessed whether anesthetic eye drops reduce pain in people with corneal abrasions. We also examined whether anesthetic eye drops influence the healing of the corneal wound or cause unwanted effects on the eyes. We performed a systematic review by searching for studies that compared anesthetic eye drops with no treatment, inactive eye drops, or a different medication. We summarized the review findings and reported results along with our confidence about the evidence based on the study design and method. We found nine studies that had enrolled 556 people aged 17 years or older. Four studies took place in hospital emergency care settings and five took place in eye surgery settings. Most studies were one week long, but their length ranged from two days (one study) to six months (another study). Only four studies reported funding sources, none of which were drug companies.
In comparison with inactive treatment, anesthetic eye drops alone were effective in reducing eye pain up to 24 hours after treatment and may also be effective when combined with NSAIDs. When compared with NSAIDs, the anesthetic eye drops alone were slightly less effective at pain control. At 48 hours, anesthetics alone decreased eye pain relative to inactive eye drops but were no more effective at 72 hours. Anesthetic eye drops resulted in a slight delay in wound healing up to 72 hours after treatment. Other complications, such as infections, were slightly more frequent with anesthetics, but these complications were similar between groups up to one week after treatment. There were too few studies to know whether people responded to treatment differently when the abrasion was from an injury or from eye surgery. No study looked at quality of life.
The evidence for all outcomes in this review is very uncertain. Further research studies that enroll larger numbers of participants and follow them for at least one week are likely to change our findings. We are not confident of the conclusions suggested by the evidence found for this review of the effectiveness and safety of anesthetic eye drops because of the flawed collection and reporting of data, and the small size of the studies. The evidence is up-to-date as of 10 February 2023.
Some of the trials contributing data to the review had methodological problems, which may have introduced bias and inconsistent results into this review. Also, we believe that the difference in study design with regards to whether the treatment was masked from the patients and clinicians (e.g. with a placebo tablet) had an impact on the rates of withdrawal from the study treatments, which also is likely to have impacted on the outcomes related to seizure control
These problems may have affected the results of this review and we judged the quality of the evidence provided by this review to be moderate to low quality. We do not suggest using the results of this review alone for making a choice between phenytoin or phenobarbitone for the treatment of epilepsy. Future trials comparing these drugs or any other antiepileptic drugs should be designed using high-quality methods to ensure results are also of high quality.
The evidence is current up to 15 November 2021. We included four studies with a total of 3699 participants. All studies included were randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of women aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. The studies compared weekly versus tri-weekly dosing of paclitaxel, plus carboplatin. We found that, compared with tri-weekly paclitaxel dosing, weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin likely slightly improves progression-free survival, although results in little to no difference in overall survival (high-certainty evidence).
For adverse effects, we found that weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin likely results in little to no difference in severe low neutrophil count (a type of white blood cell that helps to fight infections) (moderate-certainty evidence); increases severe anaemia (haemoglobin level - an important component of red blood cells) (high-certainty evidence) and may result in little to no difference in severe damage to nerves (low-certainty evidence). Weekly dosing of paclitaxel likely prolongs progression-free survival compared to tri-weekly dosing of paclitaxel, when combined with carboplatin in the initial treatment of ovarian cancer. However, this does not improve overall survival.
In May 2016 we searched for as many relevant studies as we could find that investigated the use of topical antibiotics on surgical wounds healing by primary intention. We managed to identify 14 studies which compared topical antibiotics with no treatment, or with antiseptics (i.e. other treatments applied to the skin to prevent bacterial infection), and with other topical antibiotics. Eight of these trials involved general surgery and six involved dermatological surgery (surgery involving only the skin). Many of the studies were small, and of low quality or at risk of bias. After examining them all, the authors concluded that the risk of having a surgical site infection was probably reduced by the use of topical antibiotics applied to wounds after surgery, whether the antibiotics were compared with an antiseptic, or to no treatment. As infection is a relatively rare event after surgery, the actual reduction in the rate of infection was 4.3% on average when the use of topical antibiotic was compared with antiseptic, and 2% when use of the topical antibiotic was compared with no treatment. It would require 24 patients on average to be treated with topical antibiotics instead of antiseptic, and 50 patients to be treated with topical antibiotic compared to no treatment in order to prevent one wound infection. Four studies reported on allergic contact dermatitis, but there was insufficient evidence to determine whether allergic contact dermatitis occurred any more frequently with topical antibiotics than with antiseptics or no treatment, and this should also be considered before deciding to use them.
This plain language summary is up to date as of May 2016.
We wanted to see whether ATAD could be an effective and safe treatment for people with N-ERD. We wanted to know whether ATAD could have an effect on quality of life or control of asthma, or result in less need for (oral) corticosteroids (such as prednisone, which may have unwanted effects) and less need for surgery in people with chronic rhinosinusitis. We searched for studies that investigated aspirin (either given by mouth or sprayed directly into the nose) compared with a placebo (dummy pill). We were interested in adults with a confirmed diagnosis of aspirin intolerance with asthma or chronic rhinosinusitis, or both. We compared and summarised the results of the studies we found and rated our confidence in the evidence based on the amount and quality of the evidence found. We found five studies with a total of 211 people. The studies, which were performed in specialist care centres, compared ATAD with placebo in people with a confirmed diagnosis of N-ERD. In all studies, treatment was given by mouth. All participants had chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. People in four studies also had asthma and two studies reported that people had previous surgery for nasal polyps. Results were reported at six months after treatment, and one study reported data at 36 months. All but one study reported funding for the study.
We found that after six months of treatment, daily aspirin may result in better quality of life compared to placebo (based on three studies with 85 people). It is unclear if the treatment has any effect on control of asthma, causes unwanted effects, affects the flow of air through the nose, changes the use of nasal sprays or asthma inhalers, or changes nasal or lung symptoms. No study reported on nasal polyps at six months.
One study reported that daily aspirin for 36 months may lead to a better quality of life, but may have little or no effect on the occurrence of any serious unwanted effects, size of nasal polyps and need for surgery. No unwanted effects were reported. The study did not report other results at 36 months.
We cannot conclude how often and for how long aspirin should be taken. People in these studies could use other medications for asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis, which could have a potential influence on the results. We have little confidence in the evidence for improved quality of life. We are very unclear about the evidence for aspirin controlling asthma or causing unwanted effects. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Further, the studies were relatively small. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.
The review included randomised controlled studies comparing the use of different interventions to improve dysphagia among patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer. To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014). The review updates the previous version but still fails to present any obvious superiority of one technique over another among the different kinds of interventions. Self-expanding metal stents provided safer and more effective relief of dysphagia compared to rigid plastic stents. Other techniques like radiotherapy or brachytherapy were also suitable alternatives and might be favourable in improving quality of life and prolonging survival. Individual differences should be emphasised when the intervention type was determined. Half of the studies included in this review were of high quality. Most studies did not state the methods used to seek and report quality of life outcomes and adverse effects.
We looked at studies that compared IVIG with aspirin. Our results showed that children who received IVIG probably developed fewer coronary artery abnormalities than children treated with aspirin alone. Reporting of adverse effects varied between studies, but there was little or no difference in the number of adverse effects between groups. Acute coronary syndromes were poorly reported, so we cannot say if IVIG affected this. IVIG treatment probably reduced the duration of fever compared to aspirin alone. There was little or no difference in the need for additional treatment between IVIG and aspirin groups, and no study reported on the length of hospital stay. No deaths were reported in either group.
We looked at studies that compared high-dose IVIG regimens with medium- or low-dose regimens. Our results showed that children who received high-dose regimens probably developed fewer abnormalities. There was no apparent difference in the number of adverse effects between the high and medium- or low-dose groups. Acute coronary syndromes were poorly reported, with little or no difference seen between groups. Higher-dose regimens may reduce the duration of fever and need for additional treatment compared to medium- and lower-dose regimens. We did not find a clear difference between regimens in length of hospital stay. One death was reported in one study, so we cannot say for sure if one regimen was better than another for this outcome.
We also looked at studies that compared IVIG with prednisolone. The evidence was very uncertain for number of coronary artery abnormalities and duration of fever, and there was little or no difference between groups in adverse effects, acute coronary syndromes, and deaths. Results for all outcomes were limited by the small number of children with Kawasaki disease involved. No study reported on need for additional treatment or length of hospital stay. Our confidence in the evidence provided from the included studies differed between outcomes and ranged from very low to moderate, due to concerns about how some of the studies were carried out, differences in the regimens used, and there were often only small numbers of events and participants providing data. Our findings are in keeping with current guideline recommendations and evidence from long-term studies involving large numbers of people. The evidence is current to April 2022.
In reviewing evidence available until November 2013, we found seven eligible studies of children hospitalised with acute asthma; four of these studies (472 children one to 18 years of age) contributed data to the review. Four studies compared the combination of anticholinergics (ipratropium bromide) and beta2-agonists versus the same dose of beta2-agonists alone. Included studies enrolled both girls and boys, with a gender ratio ranging from 59% to 73% males. No additional benefit was noted by adding anticholinergics to β2-agonists in terms of duration of hospital stay in patients compared to those who received beta2-agonists alone. Two of four trials (50%) contributing data were deemed of high methodological quality. No trial reported information on serious adverse events. No statistically significant group difference was noted in other markers of response to therapy, that is, the need for supplemental asthma therapy, time to short-acting beta2-agonists spaced at four hours or longer, asthma clinical scores, lung function and overall withdrawals for any reason. No apparent benefit is derived from adding anticholinergics to beta2-agonists in children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation, that is, beyond initial treatment in the emergency department. No adverse health effects were reported, yet the small number of trials combined with inadequate reporting prevents firm reassurance regarding the safety of anticholinergics. In the absence of trials conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU), no conclusion can be drawn regarding children with very severe exacerbations who are admitted to the ICU. Our findings support the ongoing recommendations provided by national and international guidelines. This review is based on a small number of identified trials conducted in children with acute asthma. All trials contributing to the primary outcome are of high methodological quality, but they are few. As the addition of new trials may change the conclusion, the quality of evidence was downgraded from high to moderate. Additional and larger trials are needed.
The authors of this review wanted to compare intramuscular arteether with other drugs used to treat severe malaria. They identified two small trials with 194 participants. Both trials compared arteether with quinine in children with cerebral malaria (an unrousable coma that cannot be attributed to any other cause other than malaria). There was no difference between the drugs in the number of deaths, people with neurological symptoms, or other outcomes, but there were probably too few participants to detect differences.
We updated our extensive searches for randomised controlled trials, which are the fairest tests of treatment, in October 2021. We found nine trials, which included 1491 people with a brain haemorrhage in the past. Four trials studied short-term use of injected blood thinning drugs (known as 'anticoagulants') in immobile brain haemorrhage survivors. Three trials studied long-term use of oral anticoagulants in brain haemorrhage survivors with an irregular heart beat (known as 'atrial fibrillation'). One trial studied long-term use of oral blood thinning drugs (known as 'antiplatelet drugs') after brain haemorrhage, and another trial compared two different types of antiplatelet drug. We did not identify significant benefits or risks of short-term injected anticoagulants or long-term oral antiplatelet drugs. Although long-term oral anticoagulants reduced the risk of any major bleeding or clotting event in brain haemorrhage survivors with atrial fibrillation, the findings were not precise, and we were only moderately certain about the evidence. We did not identify significant differences in benefits or risks when comparing two long-term antiplatelet drugs (cilostazol versus aspirin) for people who had both a stroke or mini-stroke due to clotting and a brain haemorrhage in the past. Although antithrombotic drugs appear to be promising after brain haemorrhage, we cannot be certain on the basis of the trials that have been done so far. Larger trials are needed to be sure about the effects of these drugs after brain haemorrhage. Eight ongoing trials will help resolve these uncertainties if they recruit large numbers of participants.
We searched for trials which looked at the health outcomes for women and babies after specific interconception care, and compared the outcomes for standard care (with no interconception care of this type). Our search identified one trial which has yet to issue a full set of results, plus two further trials; one of these is still underway and the other has yet to be published. Because there are no studies currently available, there is not enough evidence at present to say if interconception care for women with a history of GDM can help to improve the health of mothers and their infants. More high-quality studies are needed, which assess both short- and long-term health outcomes for women and their babies, as well as evaluating the impact on the health services.
Researchers from Cochrane searched for all available literature up to 30 November 2014. One randomised controlled trial met our inclusion criteria. In this review, the efficacy of oral zinc salt was compared with placebo. One study enrolling 294 infants was identified. This study evaluated oral zinc salt, given in a dose of 5 mg twice daily to infants between 25 and 168 hours old. The administration of oral zinc salt did not affect the incidence of jaundice (hyperbilirubinaemia) in these infants.
We searched for clinical trials in which NSAIDs were used to treat symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults. The latest search was in January 2017. Six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, randomising 292 participants to treatment with NSAID or placebo. NSAIDs tested were etoricoxib 90 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily, naproxen 1000 mg daily, and tenoxicam 20 mg daily; 146 participants received NSAID and 146 placebo. Study duration was between three and eight weeks. Not all studies reported the outcomes of interest. We found no difference between NSAID or placebo for a range of outcomes. Pain reduction by half or better was experienced by 1 in 10 with NSAID and 2 in 10 with placebo. Pain reduction by a third or better was experienced by about 2 in 10 with both NSAID and placebo. Side effects were experienced by 3 in 10 with NSAID and 2 in 10 with placebo. The evidence was of very low quality. This means that the research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The chance that the real effect of NSAIDs could be substantially different is very high. Small studies like those in this review tend to overestimate results of treatment compared to the effects found in larger, better studies. The very low-quality evidence and the lack of any obvious benefit mean that NSAIDs cannot be regarded as useful for the management of fibromyalgia.
We found five trials comparing different ways of giving antibiotics when treating exacerbations in a total of 183 people with cystic fibrosis. Two trials compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenous antibiotics alone (77 participants) and three trials compared a combination of inhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone (106 participants). In all trials, the inhaled antibiotics were compared to the same antibiotics given intravenously. The numbers of participants in each trial ranged from 16 to 62. Inhaled antibiotics alone versus intravenous antibiotics alone
One trial (18 participants) reported a perceived improvement in lifestyle in both groups, but neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but neither reported any difference between treatment groups. One trial (18 participants) reported no difference in the need for additional antibiotics and the second trial (59 participants) reported on the length of time until the next exacerbation - there was no difference between inhaled or intravenous antibiotics for either outcome. Only one trial (18 participants) measured adverse events and sputum microbiology, but did not find any difference between treatments for either outcome.
Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone
One trial found that there is likely no difference in quality of life between treatments. All of the trials reported lung function, but found no difference between groups. One trial showed there to be little or no difference in the time until the next exacerbation. None of the trials reported on the need for additional antibiotics; however, one trial (28 participants) found no difference in the number of hospital admissions between groups. There may be no difference between groups in adverse events and one trial (62 participants) reported no difference in the appearance of antibiotic-resistant organisms. We graded the certainty of the evidence as very low or low. We had concerns since only one trial stated how the participants were diagnosed with CF or how they defined an exacerbation. It was not possible to keep secret which treatment the participants were receiving, as the trials compared different ways of giving the antibiotics; we thought this would likely influence some of the results. We were not sure whether the participants were put into the different groups truly at random and we do not know how this might have affected the results.
This review aimed to assess whether increasing fluid intake of breastfeeding mothers has a beneficial effect on breast milk production and infant growth. However, the review only identified one small quasi-randomised controlled trial (involving 210 women). The trial was of low quality and did not report on two of this review's important outcomes (satisfactory weight gain in the infant or duration of exclusive breastfeeding). The study did report on breast milk production (this review's other main outcome), but the data were not in a format that would permit further analysis in this review. The trial reported that advising women to consume extra fluids did not result in increased breast milk production, as measured by test feeds (also known as test weighing). In the 1950s, when the study was conducted, it was common for babies in developed countries to be weighed before and after a feed, known as test weighing or test feeding. However, this practice is not now routinely practiced for term infants due to concerns about lack of precision as a measure of breast milk production. The included study did not report any of this review's secondary outcomes: duration of any breastfeeding; mother's satisfaction with breastfeeding; hydration in mother; dehydration in the infant; or episodes of gastrointestinal illness.
The effect of additional fluids for breastfeeding mothers remains unknown, due to a lack of well-conducted trials. However, because the physiological basis for any such improvement remains unclear, the conduct of further clinical trials may not be a priority. There is not enough evidence to support an increased fluid intake beyond what breastfeeding mothers are likely to require to meet their physiological needs.
This review included six studies involving over 1345 TBAs, more than 32,000 women and approximately 57,000 births and examined the effect of TBA training, or additional training, on TBA behaviour and on pregnancy outcomes. We conclude that while there are a few more studies meeting the inclusion criteria and the results are promising for some outcomes, more evidence is needed to establish the potential of TBA training to improve peri-neonatal mortality. A lack of contrast in training in the intervention and control clusters and an insufficient number of studies may have contributed to the lack of observed differences in maternal deaths and deaths of their babies (early neonatal deaths).
This review suggested that 54 out of every 100 patients who had chemotherapy after surgery were alive after three years, compared to 45 out of every 100 patients who received only surgery. Although these results are encouraging, there are not enough trials or patients for these results to be completely reliable. More randomised trials are needed. This review should encourage greater participation in ongoing randomised trials.
We included seven trials with 1497 women who had HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in this review. They were assigned by chance to receive trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy (taxane, anthracycline or capecitabine in four studies), hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitors including letrozole or anastrozole in two studies) or targeted therapy (lapatinib in one study). Women treated with trastuzumab were followed up until disease progression in five studies and beyond disease progression in two studies. The length of trastuzumab administration varied between 8.7 and 30 months, and follow-up averaged two years after starting trastuzumab.
All studies found that trastuzumab extends time to disease progression, with gains varying between two and 11 months, and in five studies it extended time to death by between five and eight months. However, some patients develop severe heart toxicity (congestive heart failure) during treatment. While trastuzumab reduces breast cancer mortality by one-fifth, the risk of heart toxicity is between three and four times more likely. If 1000 women were given standard therapy alone (with no trastuzumab) about 300 would survive and 10 would have heart toxicities. With the addition of trastuzumab to this treatment, an additional 73 would have their lives prolonged, and an additional 25 would have severe heart toxicity. Omitting the anthracycline-trastuzumab arms (which would not be regarded as standard of care) 21 patients would have severe heart toxicity (11 more than the chemotherapy alone group). These heart toxicities are often reversible if the treatment is stopped once heart disease is discovered. Women with advanced disease might choose to accept this risk. On balance, this review shows that with trastuzumab the time to disease progression and survival benefits outweigh the risk of heart harm.
Trastuzumab does not increase the risk of haematological toxicities, such as neutropenic fever and anaemia; however, it seems to raise the risk of neutropenia. There were insufficient data on the impact of trastuzumab on quality of life, treatment-related deaths and brain metastases to reach a conclusion for these outcomes.
We rated the overall quality of the evidence as moderate, with the main weaknesses being the fact that all studies included were open-label (not blinded), which may have affected the outcome assessments for time to disease progression and toxicities, and that two studies have not published their results for mortality. Furthermore, the recruitment in three out of seven studies was stopped early and in three trials more than 50% of patients in the control groups were permitted to switch to the trastuzumab arms at disease progression, making it more difficult to understand the real net benefit of trastuzumab on mortality. The evidence to support the use of trastuzumab beyond disease progression is limited.
It is important to highlight that, although trastuzumab is used for women with HER2-positive early breast cancer, the women enrolled in these metastatic trials were not previously treated with trastuzumab. The effectiveness of trastuzumab for women relapsing after adjuvant trastuzumab is still an open issue, although it is likely that it is offered to the majority of them.
In most industrialized countries, drowning is one of the top killers of children, especially young children. Medical care offers little to help drowning victims, and thus survival must rely on prevention of the drowning. The review found no trials of pool fencing. However evidence from other studies found that pool fencing that adequately prevents children reaching the pool unsupervised can prevent about three-quarters of all child drownings in pools. Fencing which completely encircles the pool and isolates it from the house is much more effective than methods where children can still gain access to the pool through the house.
There are many ways of performing a caesarean section and the techniques used depend on a number factors including the clinical situation and the preference of the operator. The peritoneum is a thin membrane of cells supported by a thin layer of connective tissue, and during caesarean section these peritoneal surfaces have to be cut through in order to reach the uterus and for the baby to be born. Following a caesarean section, it has been standard practice to close the peritoneum by stitching (suturing) the two layers of tissue that line the abdomen and cover the internal organs, to restore the anatomy. It has however been suggested that peritoneal adhesions may be more likely rather than less likely when the peritoneum is sutured, possibly as a result of a tissue reaction to the suture material. This review of trials sought to address whether to routinely suture these thin layers of tissue or not after delivering a baby by caesarean section. Twenty-nine randomised controlled trials were identified, with differences in their methodological quality; 21 trials involving over 17,000 women contributing data to the review. Several minutes were saved when the peritoneum was not stitched, and with a shorter period of hospital stay in most of the women. Postoperative adhesion formation was assessed in only four trials with 282 women, and no difference was found when leaving both layers of peritoneum unclosed was compared with closure of both. Longer-term outcomes were not adequately assessed, particularly adhesion formation, subfertility and ease of other surgeries in later life. Although the methodological quality of trials was variable, the results were in general consistent between the trials of better and poorer quality. Further studies are needed to further assess all these outcomes.
The evidence is current to August 2017. We searched the literature and found a total of 2554 citations that were potentially relevant. After reviewing each of these, we found 11 articles describing clinical trials that could help us answer our question. Taken together, these trials included 12,944 adult participants who suffered cardiac arrest either in-hospital or out-of-hospital. The newest studies identified in this update are larger and of higher quality than those that had been identified in prior versions of this review. Several studies were sponsored by device manufacturers. We found that available studies have important differences from one another. The most important differences were the type of mechanical device studied and the type of CPR protocol provided for patients assigned to the manual chest compression group. These differences make comparisons across studies challenging. Some studies reported improvements in rate of survival for patients treated with mechanical chest compressions compared to patients treated with manual chest compressions, while others reported no difference or even suggested harm associated with mechanical chest compressions. When considering all of the identified studies together, it seems like mechanical chest compression devices probably have a very similar effect on survival when compared with high-quality manual chest compressions. With the inclusion of several large studies, the overall quality of evidence has improved considerably, and now may be considered to be of low to moderate quality.
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of collaborative care in comparison to standard or usual care. Collaborative care aims to improve both the physical and mental health of people living with long-term conditions. All definitions agree that it seeks to develop closer working relationships and better communication between primary care (general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses) and specialist health care (such as Community Mental Health Teams, including psychiatrists and psychologists). There are different ways in which this can be achieved, making collaborative care complex. Greater joined-up working between services is expected to provide someone with a severe mental illness (SMI) with better care, based in the community, which is often a less stigmatised and stigmatising setting than hospital. It is also important because about 31% of people with SMI living in the UK are seen only in a primary care setting. Electronic databases were searched in 2020 and 2021 for trials of collaborative care. The primary outcomes of interest were quality of life, mental health and admissions to hospital. We included eight studies in this review. This is an update of the original review published in 2013, which included only one study. This version is based on new searches of the literature that identified an additional seven studies. No differences were shown in quality of life, mental state or admissions to a psychiatric hospital at 12 months. One study showed an improvement in disability at 12 months. Disability was used as an indirect measure of how well people function in their lives, in terms of their social roles and activities.
Although personal recovery and experience of care/satisfaction were outcomes that those with ongoing mental health problems highlighted as important, none of the included studies measured these. Our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. Most of the studies included did not meet a strict definition of collaborative care (what we called type A collaborative care) and there were large variations in the interventions delivered. Furthermore, the majority of evidence was either low- or very low-certainty. Further research is needed to determine whether collaborative care is good for people with a diagnosis of severe mental illness in terms of clinical outcomes or helping people feel better, as well as its cost-effectiveness. Further high-quality RCTs with a clear focus on assessing outcomes directly related to collaborative care are needed in this area, which may also benefit from mixed-methods and qualitative research to understand how collaborative care can best be delivered. None of the studies measured adverse effects of collaborative care.

In this review of randomized controlled trials, a commercially available inactivated vaccine given in two doses was shown to provide disease protection for at least one year after vaccination, but with some adverse events. Disease protection by two vaccines, widely used in China but presently commercially unavailable, has not been investigated in randomized controlled trials. Further research is needed on all currently used as well as newly developed vaccines.
We conducted a review to determine the effectiveness of adding oxygen to exercise training in comparison to exercise training without oxygen supplementation in people with COPD. Five studies addressed the question although, because of measurement of different outcomes, the maximum number available for looking at any individual outcome was three (31 patients receiving oxygen versus 32 not). People with COPD may exercise longer and have less shortness of breath when using oxygen during an exercise-training program. These studies did not look at the effect of oxygen on shortness of breath in daily life. From the evidence to date, it is not possible to determine whether individuals with COPD should use oxygen during exercise training. Stronger studies with more participants are required in order to understand how oxygen-supplemented exercise training for people with COPD will affect their shortness of breath, activity and quality of life.
We included six randomised studies (involving 122 pregnant women) but only four studies (involving 116 women) contributed to the analyses. Our review found that there is not enough reliable evidence to compare planned caesarean delivery with planned vaginal delivery. Sometimes a planned caesarean cannot happen because labour progresses too quickly and sometimes, even though vaginal delivery is planned, complications arising during labour may make a caesarean section necessary. The review found that not enough women have been recruited into trials and, therefore, the decision how best to deliver a preterm baby, either cephalic or breech presentation, remains opinion and current practice within a hospital, rather than being evidence-based.
All four trials were stopped early, due to difficulties with recruiting women. There were no data on serious maternal complications including admissions to intensive care unit. However, there were seven cases of major maternal postpartum complications in the group allocated to planned caesarean section (wound dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, endotoxic shock and puerperal sepsis) and none in the group randomised to vaginal delivery. Excess blood loss from the birth canal after childbirth (postpartum haemorrhage) was not clearly different between the two groups, nor was birth asphyxia or respiratory distress syndrome or injury to the baby at birth.
We included 20 studies with a total of 2125 participants covering 23 different treatments. Triple-combination cream was significantly more effective at lightening melasma when compared to hydroquinone alone or to dual combinations such as tretinoin and hydroquinone, tretinoin and fluocinolone acetonide, or hydroquinone and fluocinolone acetonide. Tretinoin was more effective at lightening melasma compared to placebo, as was the skin-whitening complex Thiospot. However, many studies were of a poor quality with a only small number of participants.
The side-effects reported most frequently by both participants and clinicians were dry, red, and sore skin. No serious side-effects were seen.
More evidence is needed on other treatments which are widely used, including the role of sunscreens which were recommended in almost all studies. There is a need for high-quality studies comparing the treatments for this difficult to manage condition. For example, studies should have a minimum follow-up period of 6 months and should clearly categorise participant groups such as age, type of melasma, and duration of the condition at the start of the trial so that these differences can be considered when assessing results. Addtionally, study outcomes should include participants' views in a standardised manner because they may perceive the degree of skin lightening differently to the trial investigators.
We identified 19 randomized controlled trials and included 11, but only eight contributed data. The most commonly studied methods of skin closure were non-absorbable staples compared with absorbable subcutaneous sutures. Staples were associated with similar outcomes in terms of wound infection, pain and appearance compared with sutures. Non-absorbable staples had an increased risk of skin separation and, therefore, reclosure. Skin separation was defined differently across trials and removal of staples varied from about day three to day seven postoperatively.
There is not enough evidence from the included studies to say which method of closing the caesarean skin incision is superior. Too few trials compared different kinds of sutures. The use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infection was not reported in most trials.
We included information from 17 clinical trials involving a total of 1264 patients. Compared with usual care in this patient group, we found that NIV was more beneficial for reducing deaths and the number of patients who needed to be intubated. On average, risk of dying was reduced by 46% and risk of needing intubation was reduced by 65%. Reviewers rated the quality of evidence for both of these findings as 'moderate' (according to GRADE criteria). People who had NIV spent an average of three and a half days less in hospital than those who did not. This review provides convincing evidence to support the use of NIV as an effective treatment strategy for patients admitted to hospital for acute exacerbations of COPD and respiratory failure.
Through comprehensive search and screening of medical databases, we found two clinical studies that tested different treatments. One study, with 130 participants included, compared hyperfractionated radiotherapy (six-week course with treatment twice a day ) with conventional radiotherapy (six-week course with treatment once a day ). The second study, with 71 participants included, compared hypofractionated radiotherapy (three-week course with treatment once a day ) with conventional radiotherapy. For the comparison of hyperfractionated radiotherapy and conventional radiotherapy, there was no clear evidence of effect on OS, event-free survival (EFS; time from diagnosis, study entry, or treatment to disease progression, disease relapse, a second tumour, or death), radiological response (a reduction in tumour size of more than 50%), and toxicities (damage to the body due to radiotherapy).
For the comparison of hypofractionated radiotherapy and conventional radiotherapy, there was no clear evidence of effect on OS, progression-free survival (PFS; time from diagnosis, study entry, or treatment to disease progression), and side effects. For the hyperfractionated radiotherapy, when compared with conventional therapy, the quality of evidence was low for OS and EFS, and very low for radiological response and toxicities.
For the hypofractionated radiotherapy, when compared with conventional therapy, the quality of evidence was moderate for OS, and low for PFS and toxicities.
This review of clinical trials covered 58 studies in which nurses delivered a stop-smoking intervention to smokers. More than 20,000 participants were included in the main analysis, including hospitalized adults and adults in the general community. The most recent search was conducted in January 2017. All studies reported whether or not participants had quit smoking at six months or longer. This review found moderate-quality evidence that advice and support from nurses could increase people's success in quitting smoking, whether in hospitals or in community settings. Eleven studies compared different nurse-delivered interventions and did not find that adding more components changed the effect. The quality of evidence was moderate, meaning that further research may change our confidence in the result. This is because results were not consistent across all of the studies, and in some cases there were not very many studies contributing to comparisons.
We selected studies that assessed the effect of dietary calcium interventions such as supplementation or food fortification on blood pressure in normotensive people of all ages. Searches were last run in September 2020. This review analysed information from 20 trials of which 18 trials (3140participants) provided date for the effect of the intervention. We found that an increase in calcium intake slightly reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 1.37 mmHg lower and by 1.45 mmHg lower, respectively. This effect was higher with doses of calcium above 1000 mg/day. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 1.05 mmHg with doses of calcium 1000 to 1500 mg/day and by 2.79 mmHg with doses of calcium equal to or over 1500 mg/day.
We noted a reduction in blood pressure in both men and women and at ages from 11 to 82 years old, but the reduction was greater among younger people. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 1.86 mmHg among those less than 35 years and by 0.97 mmHg among those 35 years or older.
None of the studies reported adverse events. We need further research to determine the ideal dosage of supplementation and whether it is more effective and safer as part of the diet or as a supplement. We found high quality of evidence for systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both men and women. The quality of evidence was also high for participants 35 years or older and moderate for younger people.
The quality of evidence was high for doses of calcium of 1000 to 1500 mg/day and was moderate for lower or higher doses.
Five of the 18 trials were industry funded.
We searched medical and dental sources for studies up to 21 January 2015. We identified five relevant studies. They were at high risk of bias because the participants knew which treatment they received and so did the people who treated them.
Four studies compared crowns with fillings. Two of them compared metal crowns fitted using the conventional method with fillings and two compared metal crowns fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of the studies also compared the Hall Technique with 'non-restorative caries treatment' (not using either a filling or crown but opening the cavity to make it possible to clean with a toothbrush, sealing with fluoride varnish and encouraging toothbrushing). The final study compared crowns made of two different materials (stainless steel versus stainless steel with a white covering). We looked at what happened for each treatment at the time of the dental appointment or within 24 hours of treatment, in the short term (less than 12 months) and long term (12 months to 48 months). Teeth restored with preformed crowns are less likely to develop problems (e.g. abscess) or cause pain in the long term, compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique (no injections or tooth trimming) gave less discomfort at the time of the appointment, when compared with fillings. Crowns may increase the risk of gingival bleeding but this result was unclear. Only one small study compared crowns with non-restorative caries treatment and one small study compared metal and white crowns, and we could draw no reliable conclusions from these. Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in any of the studies: these included time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns are more effective than fillings for managing decay in primary molar teeth. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns fitted using the Hall Technique are less likely to cause abscesses and pain than fillings. The evidence comparing preformed crowns with non-restorative caries management, and comparing preformed metal crowns with preformed white crowns, is very low quality so we do not know which is better. Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with decay, or that have had pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings.
All included trials randomised participants with acute respiratory infections to receive antibiotics based on procalcitonin levels ('procalcitonin-guided' group) or a control group. The trials were performed in primary care, the emergency department and medical wards, and the intensive care unit. Included participants had acute upper or lower respiratory infections, including pneumonia, bronchitis, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and others. All studies were investigator-initiated trials. Half of the trials were funded by national agencies or did not report funding, and half of the trials received funding from the biomarker industry (e.g. Thermo Fisher Scientific). We studied 6708 participants from 26 trials in 12 countries. Mortality at 30 days was significantly lower in procalcitonin-guided participants compared to control participants (286 deaths in 3336 procalcitonin-guided participants (8.6%) versus 336 deaths in 3372 controls (10.0%)). There was no significant difference with regard to treatment failures. Results were similar for different clinical settings (primary care, emergency department, intensive care unit) and types of respiratory infection. Regarding antibiotic exposure, participants in the procalcitonin-guided group had a 2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure and a reduction in antibiotic-related side effects (16.3% versus 22.1%). The quality of the evidence was high for mortality and antibiotic exposure. Most of the trials did not use blinding, however we did not expect that mortality would be biased by this limitation. The quality of the evidence was moderate for treatment failure and antibiotic-related side effects because the definitions for these endpoints among trials were not identical.
We found one randomised controlled trial and nine observational studies that examined this question. Overall we found that in couples in which the infected partner was being treated with antiretroviral drugs the uninfected partners had, at worst, more than 40% lower risk of being infected than in couples where the infected partner was not receiving treatment. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) already recommends antiretroviral treatment for all persons with ≤350 CD4 cells/µL, we also examined studies that had studied couples in which the infected partners had CD4 counts higher than this level. We found that there is strong evidence from the randomised controlled trial that in this group HIV was less likely to be transmitted to uninfected partners from treated infected partners than from untreated infected partners.
The evidence is current to June 2019. We included eight trials (1976 analysed participants). One included trial assessed salt bath plus UVB versus other treatment without UVB (psoralen bath + UVA), but it did not report our primary outcomes for this comparison. Eight trials assessed our second comparison of interest: salt bath with UVB versus other treatment with UVB or UVB only, and those that reported any outcomes of interest (only five studies) specifically compared salt bath with UVB versus UVB only.
No study reported our secondary outcomes. The duration of trials in total ranged between at least two months and up to 13 months. Outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment.
We analysed trials in which different treatments were applied to different participants, and we separately analysed trials in which different treatments were applied to the same participant, but to different body parts. Participants were male or female, and their ages mostly ranged from 41 to 50 years. In five studies, the median PASI score at baseline ranged from 15 to 18 and was balanced between treatment arms. Three studies did not report PASI score. Three studies were sponsored by commercial spa or salt companies, one by health insurance companies, one by an association of dermatologists, and three did not report on funding. Half of the studies were conducted in multiple centres; the remainder were conducted in single centres. Most of the studies were conducted in Germany; all were based in Europe. No study reported primary outcome data for the comparison salt bath with UVB versus other treatment without UVB; five studies reported primary outcome data for salt bath with UVB versus UVB only. With respect to achieving PASI-75, the pooled data of two studies indicated that salt bath + UVB may reduce psoriasis severity compared to UVB only (low-certainty evidence); however, these two studies were conducted by the same group, and the German Spas Association funded one of the trials (the other trial did not report any funding source). Neither of the studies hid the treatment allocation from the outcome assessors.
When assessing treatment-related adverse events requiring withdrawal, data from three other studies showed there may be little to no difference between salt bath plus UVB and the comparator UVB only (low-certainty evidence). The adverse events included skin irritation and severe itch immediately after Dead Sea salt soaks (salt bath + UVB group), and inadequate response to phototherapy and conversion to psoralen bath + UVA (UVB only group). We judged the evidence for ‘PASI-75’ and ‘treatment-related adverse events requiring withdrawal’ as low certainty. Our confidence was affected by limitations, such as risk of bias (examples being inadequate blinding and high probability of publication bias). The reporting of our outcomes was non-existent or limited.
The review includes three trials; one for 12 weeks and two with four-year follow up. We could not combine any data. Trials showed that oral steroids of 1mg/kg to 2 mg/kg (prednisolone equivalent) given every other day seemed to slow the advance of lung disease. However, there are serious adverse effects such as cataracts and the slowing of growth at the higher dose. These led to one trial stopping early. Follow-up data show that catch-up growth started two years after treatment ceased. Treatment must use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration of therapy to reduce the risk of a permanent effect on growth. A dose of 1 mg/kg on alternate days might be considered for up to 24 months, but close attention should be paid to adverse effects. We do not expect any further trials of this treatment to be undertaken, so we do not plan to continue to regularly update the review. However, if any new information is published, we will include this when it is available. This is an update of a previously published review.
Systematic reviews can help with this process by bringing together the relevant evidence and using clear methods which seek to minimise bias. Interventions to help improve the uptake of systematic review evidence have been developed to help with improving the use of evidence. We identified eight studies which evaluated the effectiveness of these types of interventions. There was some evidence to show that a clear message, based on systematic review evidence, which is targeted and disseminated to the relevant healthcare professionals may improve evidence-based practice. If the aim is to help decision-makers increase their awareness and knowledge of systematic review evidence, and evidence-based practice, then interventions that address some of these aims have been evaluated but have shown little effect on practice.
The evidence is current to July 2015. We found no new studies in this update of the review. This review identified three randomised controlled trials that compared giving platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding when the platelet count is 10 x 109/L (the current standard) or below versus giving platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding at higher platelet count levels (20 x 109/L or below or 30 x 109/L or below). None of the studies compared a lower trigger or alternative trigger to the current standard. These trials were conducted between 1991 and 2001 and included 499 participants. Two trials included adults with leukaemia who were receiving chemotherapy. One trial included children and adults receiving a stem cell transplant.
Two of the three studies reported sources of funding. Neither of the studies that reported funding sources were industry sponsored. Giving platelet transfusions to people with low platelet counts due to blood cancers or their treatment to prevent bleeding when the platelet count was 10 x 109/L or below did not increase the risk of bleeding compared to giving a platelet transfusion at higher platelet counts (20 x 109/L or below or 30 x 109/L or below).
Giving platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding only when the platelet count was 10 x 109/L or below resulted in a reduction in the number of platelets given. We found no evidence to demonstrate that giving a platelet transfusion when the platelet count was 10 x 109/L or below decreased the number of transfusion reactions compared to giving platelet transfusions at higher platelet counts (20 x 109/L or below or 30 x 109/L or below).
None of the three studies reported any quality of life outcomes.
Findings from this review were based on three studies and 499 participants. Without further evidence, it is reasonable to continue using platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding based on the current standard transfusion threshold (10 x 109/L). The evidence for most of the findings was of low quality. This was because participants and their doctors knew which study arm the participant had been allocated to, and also the estimate of the treatment effect was imprecise.
This review examines the extent to which parenting programmes (relatively brief and structured interventions that are aimed at changing parenting practices) are effective in treating physically abusive or neglectful parenting. A total of seven studies of mixed quality were included in the review. The findings show that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of parenting programmes to reduce physical abuse or neglect (i.e. using objective assessments of abuse such as reports of child abuse; children on the children protection register etc). There is, however, limited evidence to show that some parenting programmes may be effective in improving some outcomes that are associated with physically abusive parenting. There is an urgent need for further rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of parenting programmes that are specifically designed to treat physical abuse and neglect, either independently or as part of broader packages of care.
We found only two randomised controlled trials in which the effects of amifostine were compared with placebo. The two randomised clinical trials investigated 130 patients treated with high dose radioactive iodine for thyroid cancer. Altogether data from the two trials suggest that amifostine has no obvious protective effects on the salivary glands in these patients. Two patients in one study collapsed after initiation of amifostine therapy and had to be treated by withdrawing the infusion and volume substitution. Both patients recovered without sequelae.
Until better data become available, the use of sour candy or lemon juice to increase salivation might be more appropriate during radioactive iodine treatment for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Patients should be well informed of the importance of hydration, acid stimulation and glandular massage after radioactive iodine treatment. In addition, early recognition and treatment of xerostomia may improve outcomes.
The review authors searched published medical articles to clarify the role of gemcitabine (given by injection into a vein) compared with placebo (an inactive substance or preparation used as a control intervention in an experiment), or with no intervention, or with non-gemcitabine chemotherapy combinations in the treatment of people with advanced bile duct cancer. The review authors looked for randomised clinical trials, where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatments groups, in order to perform statistical analysis from which to draw conclusions about the intervention. The evidence is current to June 2017. The review authors found seven randomised clinical trials, and judged all of them to be at high risk of bias. These trials randomised 600 people with advanced bile duct cancer. The majority of these trials suggested that there were no demonstrable differences in either benefits or harms between gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy regimens compared with non-gemcitabine chemotherapy combinations. Only one trial, comparing gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus S-1 plus cisplatin suggested that gemcitabine-containing regimens might decrease death. The review authors identified three ongoing randomised clinical trials.
As far as funding goes, two of the seven trials were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, three were not sponsored by the industry, and the remaining two trials provided no information about funding. The evidence obtained from the seven low-quality randomised trials was insufficient to prove whether or not gemcitabine-containing combinations are better than non-gemcitabine-containing combinations for people with advanced bile duct cancer. Moreover, gemcitabine-based combinations showed an increase in non-serious adverse events, particularly haematological toxicities (damage to blood and body tissues). More randomised clinical trials are needed.
This systematic review was undertaken to see if giving folate to people with depressive disorders reduced their depressive symptoms. Three randomized trials were identified, involving a total of 247 people. In all three trials, folate was well tolerated. In two of these trials, folate was added to other antidepressant drug treatment and there was limited evidence that folate helped. In the third trial, folate was compared to trazodone, an antidepressant drug. No difference was found. There is therefore limited evidence that adding folate to other antidepressant may be helpful, but larger trials are needed before patients and clinicians can be confident that it will be helpful.
There are many types of chemotherapy used in triple-negative breast cancer. We wanted to find out if a specific class of chemotherapy called 'platinum-based chemotherapy' increases:
– the length of time people stayed alive without cancer recurrence after diagnosis (disease-free survival);
– the total length of life after diagnosis (overall survival);
– the likelihood that the cancer had disappeared in the removed breast and lymph node tissue when chemotherapy was given before surgery (pathological complete response).
We also wanted to find out if platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with more unwanted outcomes like chemotherapy delays, dose reductions or side effects. We searched for studies looking at chemotherapy for early triple-negative breast cancer that compared regimens containing platinum chemotherapy to regimens without platinum chemotherapy.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and size. We found 20 studies that involved 4688 people with early triple-negative breast cancer, with average follow-up in studies ranging from three to eight years.
Platinum chemotherapy was associated with longer disease-free survival and overall survival, and reduced the chance of disease recurrence and death by about one third. These benefits were seen with chemotherapy used before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant). When used before surgery, it also improved the likelihood of a pathological complete response.
We did not find that any particular subgroup, such as people with a high-risk gene mutation, had more benefit from platinum chemotherapy.
However, people receiving platinum chemotherapy were more likely to need the dose of their chemotherapy to be reduced, or to have a delay in their chemotherapy. They were also more likely to stop chemotherapy early.
Platinum chemotherapy also caused more serious side effects including low blood cell counts. It was not associated with an increase in having fevers associated with low white blood cell counts (febrile neutropenia), nerve damage symptoms (neuropathy) or death caused by treatment. The evidence was generally of high quality and included enough data to make judgements to answer our main questions.
However, there were many types of chemotherapy used across studies. Although we have shown that platinum chemotherapy improves long-term outcomes, we do not know what the best chemotherapy combination is.
None of the studies reported quality of life, which we had initially set out to measure and record. This evidence is up-to-date to April 2022.
We found 14 studies comparing oral progestogens with GnRH agonists, antagonists and other progestogens in a total of 3224 women undergoing assisted reproductive technology. The evidence is current to December 2021. Fourteen well-designed studies were included in the analysis. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following GnRH antagonists is assumed to be 18%, the chance following medroxyprogesterone acetate (progestogen) would be between 14% and 32%.
Cancellation rates may have no differences between progestogens and GnRH antagonists and may be slightly reduced in GnRH agonists in comparison to medroxyprogesterone acetate 4 mg.
No conclusions can be retrieved regarding clinical pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate, when comparing progestogens with GnRH antagonists.
In women with normal number of eggs (normo-responders), micronised progesterone (progestogen) may increase by 2 to 6 the number of MII oocytes in comparison to GnRH antagonists.
There may be little or no differences in gonadotropin doses. There may be no differences in live birth rate when comparing medroxyprogesterone acetate 4 mg (progestogen) to GnRH agonist in normo-responders undergoing assisted reproductive technology.
The evidence suggests that if the chance of cycle cancellation following GnRH agonists is assumed to be 5%, the chance following medroxyprogesterone acetate 4 mg (progestogen) would be between 2% and 16%.
No conclusions can be retrieved regarding clinical pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate when comparing progestogens with GnRH agonists.
There may be little or no differences in MII oocytes.
Medroxyprogesterone acetate 4 mg (progestogen) reduces the doses of gonadotropins in comparison to GnRH agonists. None of the studies that reported live birth rate were included in the primary analysis.
- Dydrogesterone probably decreases the cancellation rate in comparison to medroxyprogesterone acetate and micronised progesterone.
- Medroxyprogesterone acetate suggested a slightly lower cancellation rate in comparison to micronised progesterone 100 mg.
- Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg probably suggests lower oocyte pick-up cancellation rates than in medroxyprogesterone acetate 4 mg.
- Data were lacking on other unwanted effects.
The evidence suggests that:
- if the chance of cancellation following medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg is assumed to be 5%, the chance following medroxyprogesterone acetate 4 mg would be between 5% and 22%;
- if the chance of cancellation following micronised progesterone 100 mg is assumed to be 17%, the chance following medroxyprogesterone acetate 4 mg would be between 8% and 24%;
- if the chance of cancellation following dydrogesterone 20 mg is assumed to be 7%, the chance following medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg would be between 6% and 17%;
- if the change of cancellation following dydrogesterone 20 mg is assumed to be 12%, the chance following medroxyprogesterone acetate 4 mg would be between 8% and 24%
- if the chance of cancellation following dydrogesterone 20 mg is assumed to be 11%, the chance following micronised progesterone 100 mg would be between 10% and 24%.
There is probably little or no difference in clinical pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate between medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg (progestogen) and dydrogesterone 20 mg (progestogen).
There may be little or no differences in MII oocytes and in gonadotropin doses.
Evidence about other moderate or severe unwanted events was poorly reported and inconclusive for all the comparisons. There remains uncertainty about whether any progestogens compared among them or to GnRH antagonists or GnRH agonists changes the chance of having a baby. However, there may be little or no differences in the egg retrieval cancellation rate when compared to GnRH antagonists and progestogens may increase the risk of cancellation when compared to GnRH agonists. Among progestogens, cancellation rate may be lower in dydrogesterone in comparison to the rest, and medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg may be better than medroxyprogesterone acetate 4 mg and micronised progesterone. The certainty of the evidence was assessed as low. The reason for this is that most comparisons included only one study that did not recruit a large enough number of women to provide meaningful results. This means that results must be treated cautiously, and further studies are needed to confirm findings.
We identified 10 studies reporting information on 5056 people with abdominal pain that started suddenly. The studies included pancreatitis due to all causes. All of the studies were of unclear or low methodological quality, which may result in arriving at false conclusions. We excluded the study that contributed approximately two-thirds of the participants included in this review from the results of the analysis presented below due to concerns about whether the participants included in the study are typical of those seen in the emergency department. The accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, and urinary trypsinogen-2 in making the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was similar. About a quarter of people with acute pancreatitis fail to be diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with these tests. The patient should be admitted and treated as having acute pancreatitis, even if these tests are normal, if there is a suspicion of acute pancreatitis. As about 1 in 10 patients without acute pancreatitis may be wrongly diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with these tests, it is important to consider other conditions that require urgent surgery, even if these tests are abnormal. The diagnostic performance of these tests decreases even further with the progression of time, and additional investigations should be performed if there is a suspicion of acute pancreatitis.
This systematic review investigated the efficacy of lithium compared to that of placebo in the maintenance treament of mood disorders (unipolar and bipolar disorder). Nine randomised studies (reporting on 825 participants) were included in the review. Lithium was more effective than placebo in preventing relapse in mood disorder overall. Lithium was more effective than placebo in bipolar disorder, though estimates of the size of the effect varied between studies. In unipolar disorder, lithium appeared to be more effective than placebo but the evidence for this was less clear cut. 
Lithium should be considered for maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder and, although the evidence is less reliable, it may be considered as one of a range of treatments with possible benefit in preventing relapse in unipolar disorder. When considering lithium maintenance therapy, patients and clinicians should take into account the evidence of efficacy, side effects and the individual's likely adherence to the recommended treatment regimen. Caution should be exercised in abruptly stopping lithium therapy in patients who have been taking it successfully for some time, due to the high risk of relapse.
We searched scientific databases from their inception to January 2017 and found 25 trials where people were randomly allocated to either a group receiving drug-eluting stents or a group receiving bare-metal stents. The 25 trials (26 comparisons) included 12,503 adults with a mean age of 60.8 years. The people receiving drug-eluting stents did seem to have a reduced risk of experiencing a serious adverse event compared with those receiving bare-metal stents, without affecting the risk of dying from any cause or specifically heart disease, or of having a heart attack. The serious adverse event likely to be avoided by those receiving drug-eluting stents seems to be repeat balloon angioplasty. No data were reported on quality of life or chest pain (angina) after receiving the stent. The evidence should be interpreted with caution, as we judged the quality to be low to very low due to limitations of the included randomised clinical trials. The reason for the very low-quality judgement was mainly due to all included trials being at high risk of bias. Consequently, the results may show more benefit of drug-eluting stents than the 'real life' effect would show. Furthermore, most of the outcomes in our review lacked sufficient statistical power. Future well-designed randomised clinical trials may therefore change the above-mentioned results.
We analysed these 17 placebo trials examining the efficacy of antidepressant treatment in older people. Just under 2000 patients were entered into the meta analysis. TCAs, SSRIs and MAOIs proved effective in both institutionalised and community patients. Low dose TCA treatment may be effective but further studies are needed.
Five randomised controlled trials enrolling 302 infants met the inclusion criteria. In an infant with tongue-tie and feeding difficulties, surgical release of the tongue-tie does not consistently improve infant feeding but is likely to improve maternal nipple pain. Further research is needed to clarify and confirm this effect. The quality of the evidence is very low to moderate because overall only a small number of studies have looked at this condition, the total number of babies included in these studies was low and some studies could have been better designed.
We found eight randomised controlled trials comparing long-term GnRH agonist therapy with no pretreatment including a total of 640 women with endometriosis prior to IVF/ICSI. The evidence is current to January 2019. Compared to no pretreatment, we are uncertain whether long-term GnRH agonist therapy prior to IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis affects the live birth rate. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth rate is assumed to be 36% with no pretreatment, the chance following long-term GnRH agonist therapy would be between 9% and 31%. We are also uncertain whether this intervention affects complication rate, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. No studies compared long-term GnRH agonist therapy to long-term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations in the evidence were lack of blinding (the process where the women participating in the trial, as well as the research staff, are not aware of the intervention used), inconsistency (differences between different studies) and imprecision (random error and small size of each study).
A total of 16 studies were included, with 24,930 randomised participants (current until May 2015). The main outcomes of interest were symptomatic (showing symptoms) VTE, including DVT and PE, and bleeding (major, clinically relevant non-major and minor bleeding). Six studies compared heparin with placebo, one compared the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin with placebo, two compared DOAC with placebo, one compared VKA with heparin, five compared DOAC with heparin and one study compared using a variety of anticoagulant treatments with placebo. Only three trials included participants undergoing knee replacement and no studies included participants undergoing hip fracture repair.
For the comparison heparin versus placebo (six studies) no differences were found between the study arms for symptomatic VTE, symptomatic DVT, symptomatic PE and major bleeding. Minor bleeding was increased in the heparin group. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was not reported.
The comparison VKA versus placebo (one study) and the comparison placebo with anticoagulants chosen at the discretion of the investigators (one study) showed no differences between the study arms for symptomatic VTE, symptomatic DVT, symptomatic PE and major bleeding. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding were not reported.
For the comparison DOACs versus placebo (two studies), reduced symptomatic VTE and symptomatic DVT were found in favour of the DOAC but no differences were found for symptomatic PE, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding.
Comparing extended-duration VKA with extended-duration LMWH (one study) there was no difference between the study arms for symptomatic VTE, symptomatic DVT, symptomatic PE, major bleeding and minor bleeding. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was not reported.
Comparing extended-duration DOAC with extended-duration LMWH (five studies) there was no difference between the study arms for symptomatic VTE, symptomatic DVT, symptomatic PE, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding. Overall, the included studies were of good methodological quality, with the majority of studies having little risk of bias due to study design and reporting. The majority of concerns came from lack of reporting of specific details. The quality of the evidence was generally moderate, either because only one study was included in a comparison, because of few events or because there were a lot of differences between the findings of the studies meaning that the data were difficult to interpret. Further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between VTE and extended-duration oral anticoagulants for knee replacement and hip fracture repair as well as outcomes such as DVT below the knee and above the knee, reoperation, wound infection and healing.
The available evidence from randomized controlled trials supports the use of subacromial corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff disease, although its effect may be small and short-lived, and it may be no better than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Similarly, intra-articular steroid injection may be of limited, short-term benefit for adhesive capsulitis. Further trials investigating the efficacy of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain are needed. Important issues that need clarification include whether the accuracy of needle placement, anatomical site, frequency, dose and type of corticosteroid influences efficacy.
Cochrane Review authors included 39 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 7249 women. All studies reported clinical pregnancy, but only 14 studies reported live birth, and only 18 reported multiple pregnancy. The evidence is current to May 2020. This review of RCTs demonstrates that we are uncertain of the effects of assisted hatching on live birth rate when compared to no assisted hatching. Assisted hatching may increase slightly multiple pregnancy rates when compared to no AH. Assisted hatching may improve slightly the chances of clinical pregnancy in women. We are uncertain about the effects of AH on miscarriage.
Only studies that report live birth and multiple pregnancy as their primary outcome measures should be performed and funded in the future. The quality of the evidence is low to very low. The main limitations are serious risk of bias associated with poor reporting of study methods, inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias.
How do drugs (or drug combinations) used to treat people of any age who have the genetic variant F508del impact their lives? Are these drugs associated with any unwanted side effects? We searched for and included studies that looked at drugs (and drug combinations) used to treat pwCF who had at least one copy of the most common CF-causing gene variant (F508del) compared to control medications.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 34 studies that involved 4781 pwCF and which lasted between 1 day and 48 weeks; all studies compared an active drug treatment to a placebo (drug containing no active treatment). We do not have enough information to decide if 14 studies should be included or not and eight studies have not yet been completed.
Eight studies looked at treatment with a single drug (monotherapy). These studies did not report any deaths or clinically relevant improvements in quality of life (QoL) scores. There was not enough evidence to show an effect on lung function. All studies reported side effects; there were a wide range of side effects each reported by a small number of participants in the studies.
There were 16 studies assessing a combination of two drugs (dual therapy), either tezacaftor plus ivacaftor or lumacaftor plus ivacaftor. One participant taking tezacaftor plus ivacaftor died, but this was not thought to be related to the treatment. Both dual therapies resulted in improvements in QoL and lung function; rates of pulmonary exacerbations (a flare-up of symptoms) were also lower. Neither dual therapy was linked to severe side effects, although people starting treatment with lumacaftor plus ivacaftor experienced shortness of breath for one to two weeks; this usually stopped without further treatment. More concerningly, in longer studies some people taking lumacaftor plus ivacaftor experienced a rise in blood pressure. Two people (out of over 500) even stopped lumacaftor plus ivacaftor treatment because of high blood pressure. These side effects were not reported for tezacaftor plus ivacaftor.
There were 11 studies assessing different combinations of three drugs (triple therapy). The combinations were based on tezacaftor with ivacaftor (or deutivacaftor, which is a similar but chemically altered version of ivacaftor) and investigators then added either elexacaftor, VX-659, VX-440 or VX-152 and compared these to either triple placebo, or tezacaftor with ivacaftor and one placebo. Some studies split groups by treatment and also by different genetic variants. No study reported any deaths. Triple therapies improved QoL scores and lung function in all comparisons, with no difference in the number or severity of side effects. Fewer people with two copies of F508del taking elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor experienced a pulmonary exacerbation than those taking the control treatment. Our certainty in the evidence ranged from uncertain to very certain, but we were quite certain of the evidence for most results. While studies generally provided few details about their design, so we could not make clear judgements on potential biases, we had fewer concerns with the larger, more recent studies. Some of our findings are based on studies that were too small to show important effects and for 16 studies the results may not be applicable to all pwCF due to them only including people of certain ages (i.e. only adults or only children). Also, one study had an unusual design where people were given monotherapy and then later a dual therapy. This review updates our earlier review. We last looked for evidence on 28 November 2022.
We searched for studies that compared combined compression and medication against either compression or medication alone. We found 34 studies with a total of 14,931 participants. The mean age of participants, where reported, was 62.7 years. Most participants had either a high-risk procedure or condition (orthopaedic surgery in 14 studies and urology, cardiothoracic, neurosurgery, trauma, general surgery, gynaecology or other types of participants in the remaining studies).
Compared to compression alone, compression plus medication was better by reducing the rate of new cases of pulmonary embolism (19 studies, 5462 participants). DVT was also reduced for compression combined with medication when compared with compression alone (18 studies, 5394 participants). The addition of a medication to compression, however, increased the risk of any bleeding compared to IPC alone, from 1% to 5.9%. Major bleeding followed a similar pattern, with an increase from 0.3% to 2.2%. Further analysis looking at different types of participants (orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic participants) showed a similar risk for DVT. It was not possible to assess differences between subgroups for pulmonary embolism.
Compared with medication alone, combined compression and medication was better by reducing pulmonary embolism (15 studies with 6737 participants). DVT was also reduced in the combined compression and medication group (17 studies with 6151 participants). No differences were observed in rates of bleeding (six studies with 1314 participants). Further analysis looking at different subgroups of participants did not show any overall difference in incidence of pulmonary embolism or DVT between orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic participants. We found our confidence in the evidence ranged from high to very low. We had concerns on how the studies were carried out, because there were small numbers of clots overall and different definitions used for bleeding between the studies. This review updates our previous evidence. The evidence is current to January 2021.
This review identified five relevant studies, comprised of 341,342 participants in total. Two of the studies were assessed to be of low risk of bias, whilst the remaining three had more substantive methodological weaknesses. Meta-analysis of all five included studies demonstrated no statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.17). Meta-analysis of the two low risk of bias studies indicated no significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30). Only one study included in this review (ERSPC) reported a significant 21% relative reduction (95% CI 31% to 8%) in prostate cancer-specific mortality in a pre-specified subgroup of men. These results were primarily driven by two countries within the ERSPC study that had very high prostate cancer mortality rates and unusually large reduction estimates. Among men aged 55 to 69 years in the ERSPC study, the study authors reported that 1055 men would need to be screened to prevent one additional death from prostate cancer during a median follow-up duration of 11 years. Harms included overdiagnosis and harms associated with overtreatment, including false-positive results for the PSA test, infection, bleeding, and pain associated with subsequent biopsy.
Therefore, we reviewed the literature to find studies that compare the effects of oral-and-written methods to those of computer-assisted family history taking on the quality of collected data as well as on allowing us to identify people who are at risk of developing diabetes. In this occasion we found no randomised controlled trials that investigated the above. We therefore suggest that more primary research is required in this area to allow an informed decision to be made by physicians, patients and policymakers.
Sepsis is the inflammatory response of the body to severe infection, which can be caused by a variety of micro-organisms including bacteria, viruses and fungi. Signs of sepsis include fever, hypothermia, rapid heart rate and respiration; and a laboratory finding of increased or decreased white blood cell count. Deaths as a result of sepsis and septic shock remain high despite giving antibiotics, especially if the functions of a persons's vital organs such as the lungs, heart and kidneys are affected. Several studies have looked into other agents than antibiotics to help the body fight the effects of sepsis. Intravenous immunoglobulin preparations contain antibodies that help the body to neutralize bacterial toxins. There are two types of preparations. These are polyclonal immunoglobulins that contain several antibodies directed at endotoxin and inflammatory mediators, and monoclonal immunoglobulins which target a specific inflammatory mediator or antigen. Intravenous immunoglobulins are blood products, specifically pooled sera derived from human donor blood.
For this updated Cochrane review, we searched the medical literature databases to January 2012. We included 43 randomized controlled trials (RCTs); 25 were RCTs of polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) with 17 in adults (1958 participants) and eight in newborn infants (3831 participants) including a large polyclonal IVIG trial on infants with sepsis that was published in 2011. The remaining 18 trials (a total of 13,413 participants) were of monoclonal antibodies. Both standard and immunoglobulin M (IgM)-enriched polyclonal immunoglobulins decreased the number of deaths in adults but not in infants. However, no reductions in adult deaths were seen with polyclonal IVIG using high quality trials only. Among newborn infants with sepsis, there is definitive evidence that standard polyclonal IVIG does not reduce the number of deaths. In the monoclonal immunoglobulin trials, anti-endotoxin antibodies showed no benefit while the anti-cytokines showed a very small reduction in deaths among adults with sepsis.
The polyclonal immunoglobulin trials in adults were small compared to the trials of monoclonal agents. The reduction in deaths observed with polyclonal IgM-enriched preparations as add-on therapy for sepsis needs to be confirmed in large studies that use high quality methods.
From the literature search in September 2014, we included one randomised controlled trial, involving 311 participants, that looked at early or delayed radiotherapy given at the time of disease progression in people with LGG. This study was well-designed and reported useful data on survival, but did not include other clinically important information, such as functional independent survival (functional, or neurological impairment, or both) and quality of life. Therefore, we felt that the trial was of unclear quality. People who received early (soon after surgery) radiotherapy had a longer time until their disease progressed than people who only had radiotherapy once the disease had progressed. However, the people that were initially observed had similar survival to the people who had early radiotherapy. Quality of life measures such as memory, executive function, and cognitive deterioration differences were not evaluated in either group. The findings did not suggest that people who received early radiotherapy lived longer than those had delayed radiotherapy. However, people who had early radiotherapy had better control over their seizures than those who had delayed radiotherapy. The toxic effects of radiotherapy were rated as minimal in both groups using a grading system which measured severity and included skin reactions, ear inflammation, mild headache, nausea, and vomiting.
Update searches in November 2019 found no new articles which met the inclusion criteria. No articles were considered eligible for inclusion in this review update. Based on the current evidence, the results should be interpreted with caution. It is unclear whether or not early radiotherapy is better than delayed radiotherapy because survival was the same in both groups. People who had early radiotherapy experienced longer periods of tumour remission compared with patients who had delayed radiotherapy. However, it is unclear if these people suffered increased rates of cognitive impairment, neuroendocrine dysfunction, or radiation necrosis compared with people who had delayed radiotherapy. Toxic effects of radiation were minimal in both groups and there were no cases of second malignancies.
We studied the evidence up to 1 May 2020. We found 31 studies with 8254 men. The studies compared SSRIs to placebo (a pill with inactive ingredients). SSRIs probably improve sexual satisfaction for men with premature ejaculation compared to placebo. They probably also improve the sense of control over ejaculation and decrease unhappiness and relationship problems. However, they likely increase side effects. We judged the quality of evidence to be moderate for SSRIs, helping men’s sense of change with treatment, happiness with intercourse, and feeling of control over ejaculation. The quality of evidence was also moderate for medicine side effects. These results mean that our evaluation is likely to be close to the truth. However, the evidence on improving relationship problems and the time to ejaculation is of low certainty. This means that the true effect of treatment on those two concerns could be different from the results of this review. That may be caused by weaknesses and variations in the studies we examined.
Eight studies including several thousand patients described 29 different questions and physical exam tests that have been used to look for spinal fractures. Most of the 29 were not accurate. The best four questions asked about use of steroids (which can cause weak bones), the patient’s age (age above 74 increases the risk of fractures) and recent trauma such as a fall. Using a combination of the best questions appears to improve the accuracy. For example, women above age 74 are more likely to have a fracture when they come to the physician complaining of back pain. In the emergency room, the best indication of a spinal fracture was a bruise or scrape on the painful area of the back.
Fractures are rare and generally do not require emergency treatment, even if red flags exist clinicians and patients can watch and wait. During the waiting period, patients should avoid treatments like exercise and manipulation that are not recommended for spinal fractures.
The worst effects of low quality red flag screening are overtreatment and undertreatment. If the tests are not accurate, patients without a fracture may get an x-ray or CT scan that they don’t need—unnecessary exposure to x-rays, extra worry for the patient and extra cost. At the other extreme (and much less common), it might be possible to miss a real fracture, and cause the patient to have extra time without the best treatment.
Most of the studies were of low or moderate quality, so more research is needed to identify the best combination of questions and examination methods.
This systematic review set out to compare the effects of 'tight' versus 'very tight' control of mild to moderate pre-existing or non-proteinuric gestational hypertension on pregnancy outcomes. It found insufficient evidence to determine which degree of control of blood pressure during pregnancy was more effective for improving outcomes for the mother and her baby. The review included two trials that studied 256 women. A blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg using methyldopa reduced the rate of admission to hospital during pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference between tight and very tight control groups regarding severe pre-eclampsia, induction of labor and cesarean delivery and no cases of eclampsia or maternal deaths.
This systematic review uses the data of individual patients from eight and published data from another six randomized controlled trials. We found that the administration of chemotherapy before surgery leads to longer survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, the junction between esophagus and stomach, and the stomach. The findings suggest that patients whose tumor is in the junction between esophagus and stomach and younger patients benefit most from the chemotherapy. Moreover, the addition of radiation to the chemotherapy seems to yield an additional advantage to patients, at least in tumors of the esophagus and the junction between esophagus and stomach. Chemotherapy before surgery does not increase the risk of suffering a complication during or after surgery.
We included 62 randomised trials involving 19,935 older participants. Most trials included more women than men; the average ages in the trials ranged from 62 to 85 years. Trials compared the interventions to an inactive control group receiving usual care (no change in usual activities) or a matched level of attention (such as social visits) or to an active control group receiving an exercise programme. We identified 43 trials that compared a multifactorial intervention with an inactive control. Multifactorial interventions led to some reduction in the rate at which people fall compared with the inactive control group, but the quality of evidence was low because of large differences in how studies were conducted. There may be little or no difference in the number of people who experienced one or more falls (fallers), recurrent falls, fall-related fractures, or experienced a fall requiring hospital admission or medical attention. Multifactorial interventions may make little difference to people's health-related quality of life. There was very limited evidence on adverse events related to the intervention; all 12 reported musculoskeletal complaints such as back pain were minor.
We did not find enough evidence to determine the effects of multifactorial interventions compared with exercise as this was only assessed in one small trial.
We identified 18 trials assessing the effects of multiple component interventions. Seventeen compared the intervention with an inactive control group and five compared the intervention with exercise. Seventeen of the trials included exercise in the intervention and another component, often education on falls prevention or home safety assessment. There was limited evidence on adverse events related to the intervention; all six reported events were minor.
Multiple component interventions probably reduce the rate at which people fall and the number of fallers compared with the inactive control group. They may also reduce the number of people who experienced recurrent falls. The evidence was not enough to determine their effects on fall-related fractures or hospital admission. Multiple component interventions may make little or no difference to the risk of a fall requiring medical attention. However, they may slightly improve a person's health-related quality of life.
Trials comparing multiple component interventions with exercise showed there may be little or no difference in the rate at which people fall and the number of fallers, but not enough evidence to determine the effects on hospital admission. Other falls outcomes were not reported. We rated the quality of the available evidence as of low or very low quality. This means that we have limited confidence about the results where the evidence is low quality, but are uncertain where the evidence is of very low quality.
In May 2015, this review identified 28 small, low quality studies involving 2564 participants looking at intra-articular morphine for pain relief after knee arthroscopy. From 9/20 studies we did not find evidence that intra-articular morphine given at a dose of 1 mg was better than placebo for pain relief. From the limited evidence available we were unable to determine how intra-articular morphine compared with morphine injected into the muscle (intra-muscular morphine). There was also low quality evidence for the effects of 1 mg intra-articular morphine compared with intra-articular bupivacaine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sufentanil, fentanyl and pethidine, so we were unsure which worked best. We were unable to determine how similar the rates of side effects such as nausea and vomiting were between intra-articular morphine and placebo. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low.
Future research should focus on finding effective analgesics for knee arthroscopy.
This updated review contains two interrupted-time-series (ITS) studies (studies in which data are collected at multiple time points before and after an intervention), one from the original review, which evaluated a targeted educational intervention aimed at reducing the incidence of wrong-site surgery, and which was found to reduce its incidence. An additional study evaluated the incidence of wrong-site surgery before and after the introduction of the Universal Protocol, however the relevance of these findings regarding the impact of the intervention is unclear given that prior to its introduction, the incidence was decreasing due to other unclear factors. Overall, this review now contains two studies, of relatively low quality evidence, on very specific populations and their generalisability to a larger audience is low.
The authors of this review examined all research studies that report an evaluation of the effectiveness of motorcycle rider courses in reducing the number of traffic offences, motorcycle rider crashes, injuries and deaths. This review included 23 research studies, including three randomised trials, two non-randomised trials, 14 cohort studies and four case-control studies. The types of rider training that were evaluated varied in content and duration. The findings suggest that mandatory pre-licence training may present a barrier to completing a motorcycle licensing process, thus possibly indirectly reducing crash, injury, death and offence rates through a reduction in exposure to riding a motorcycle. However, on the basis of the existing evidence, it is not clear if (or what type of) training reduces the risk of crashes, injuries, deaths or offences in motorcyclists and the selection of the best rider training practice can therefore not be recommended.
It is likely that some type of rider training is necessary to teach motorcyclists basic motorcycle handling techniques and to ride a motorcycle safely. It is therefore important that further research work be conducted to rigorously evaluate motorcycle rider training courses, particularly in low income countries where the main burden of motorcycle injuries and deaths occur.
This review found a small benefit in platinum-based chemotherapy over non-platinum therapy. It also found that platinum combinations may offer improved survival over single platinum and that cisplatin and carboplatin are equally effective. The trials were done when paclitaxel (an effective new drug) was not used routinely. The results therefore, will need to be looked at in the light of new evidence from paclitaxel trials.
We included evidence published up to 3 May 2021. We included findings from eight studies involving 1585 adults, with most being men (1019 men versus 506 women) with average ages 60 to 69 years. All studies were conducted in the ICU settings, and many people were severely ill and required mechanical ventilation and tube feeding for more than 48 hours. The duration of the studies ranged from three to 90 days.
Two studies (417 participants) compared less-frequent GRV monitoring with a more-frequent regimen. Two studies (500 participants) compared no GRV monitoring with frequent monitoring. One trial (329 participants) assessed the effects of GRV threshold by comparing a higher threshold at the time of aspiration against a lower threshold. Two studies (140 participants) compared the technique of returning versus discarding the aspirated/drained GRV.
We found that the evidence is uncertain about GRV monitoring (less frequent versus more frequent; no monitoring versus frequent monitoring) on mortality, pneumonia, vomiting, and length of hospital stay. Five of the eight included studies assessed mortality as an outcome measure. Most studies were poorly conducted with sparse data, which made interpretation difficult. Thus, the overall reliability of the included evidence for our review outcomes was very low, and our findings should be treated with caution.
Clinical trials have come to different conclusions about the best approach. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize available clinical research studies that have examined outcome according to donor vs. no donor status, or genetic randomization. This is a method of analysis for assessing the effect of transplantation in this disease condition. Our analysis supports matched sibling donor allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation as the approach which offers the best long-term outcomes, specifically providing optimal survival and reduced risk for ALL relapse.
Short-term studies indicate that people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease respond to the administration of oxygen when they do exercise tests. Ambulatory oxygen is the use of supplemental oxygen during exercise and activities of daily living. One way to assess if ambulatory oxygen is beneficial for a patient with COPD is to compare the effects of breathing oxygen and breathing air on exercise capacity. Some people with COPD may benefit more than others, and trials should take account of whether people who do not already meet criteria for domiciliary oxygen also respond. This review shows that there is strong evidence that ambulatory oxygen (short-term) improves exercise capacity. Further research needs to focus on which COPD patients benefit from ambulatory oxygen, how much oxygen should be provided and the long-term effect of ambulatory oxygen.
We searched for evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) through July 2018. This updated review now includes 10 RCTs involving 6242 women. Six studies focused on counseling and four studies involved reminders of next dose or appointments (+/- educational health information). All studies were conducted either in the USA or Mexico. The one study that was added neither changed the results nor improved the certainty of evidence. · improve continuation of contraception (6 studies; 2624 participants; very low certainty evidence)
· reduce discontinuation due to menstrual problems (1 study; 350 participants; low certainty evidence)
· reduce discontinuation due to adverse events (1 study; 350 participants; low certainty evidence)
· have no effect on pregnancy outcomes (3 studies, 1985 participants; very low certainty evidence) · may improve continuation of contraception (2 studies, 933 participants; very low certainty evidence)
· may make little or no difference to adherence to pills (1 study, 73 participants; moderate certainty evidence)
· may make little or no difference to on-time injections for injectable contraception (2 studies, 350 participants; low certainty evidence). There is some evidence to suggest that both intensive counseling and reminders (provided with or without educational information) may improve continuation of shorter-term hormonal contraception compared with usual family planning care.
We found 12 studies, eight weeks in duration, that randomly assigned 7439 adult people with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate hypertension to aliskiren at doses ranging from 75 mg to 600 mg or placebo. All studies were funded by the manufacturer Novartis. Detailed information regarding adverse events, obtained from nine clinical study reports submitted to regulators, are included in this update. We concluded that aliskiren is better than placebo at lowering blood pressure and that the magnitude of this effect could be similar to other classes of drugs when 300 mg, which is the maximum recommended dose, is used. Aliskiren 300 mg reduced blood pressure by eight points in the upper number (called systolic blood pressure) and five points in the lower number (called diastolic blood pressure). Aliskiren had no effect on blood pressure changeability. Due to very limited information regarding change in heart rate and pulse pressure (difference between upper and lower number) it was not possible to analyze these outcomes.
The studies were too short in duration to assess side effects. Aliskiren did not increase death, non-fatal serious adverse events or withdrawal due to side effects. The most common adverse events observed were headache, diarrhoea, dizziness and fatigue. Diarrhoea was considerably increased with aliskiren 600 mg as compared to placebo. The decrease in blood pressure at the recommended dose was rated as moderate-quality evidence and adverse event data was graded as low-quality evidence as included studies were assessed to have high likelihood of reporting and funding bias.
We searched the medical literature for studies of different treatments for jellyfish stings. We compared and summarised the results of the studies for different species of jellyfish. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size, and the consistency of findings across studies. We found nine studies with 574 participants, assessing three groups of treatments. We found no studies that assessed a fourth type of treatment (tight bandages applied to the site of the sting).
The included studies all had small numbers of participants and problems related to their methods (e.g. because participants were aware of the type of treatment, or because many participants left the study before the end). We also found some differences in the findings between studies, which we were unable to explain. We used these issues to rate our confidence in the evidence. Four studies compared hot or cold treatments. In two studies, people were stung accidentally by bluebottle jellyfish in Australia. In the other two studies, people were stung accidentally by Hawaiian box jellyfish or major box jellyfish in Australia and Hawaii, USA; these box jellyfish do not cause Irukandji syndrome (a condition that may lead to serious complications, and very occasionally to death). The studies looked at the effect of treatments on pain relief. Heat was applied to the sting site using a hot pack or hot water (with showers, baths, buckets, or hoses). Cold was applied using ice packs or cold packs. People were treated on the beach or at the hospital.
Due to our limited confidence in the available evidence, we cannot tell whether applying heat or cold to a jellyfish sting reduces or stops pain within one hour of treatment; reduces the need for retreatment or switching to the alternative treatment; reduces skin reactions in the first 24 hours (itchiness, red marks, or rashes); or causes any harms (burns or temporary redness around the area of application). This finding relates directly to the types of jellyfish described in this section. Four studies compared topical treatments that were applied to the skin on and around the sting site. In one study, people were treated on the beach after accidental stings by Hawaiian box jellyfish in Hawaii. In the remaining three studies, people volunteered to be stung in a laboratory setting.
Treatments included: fresh water, seawater, Sting Aid (a commercial product), Adolph's meat tenderiser (papain, an enzyme present in papaya), isopropyl alcohol, ammonia, heated water, acetic acid, or sodium bicarbonate. In some of these treatments, vinegar was also applied to the sting site.
Due to our low confidence in the available evidence, we cannot tell whether applying any of these treatments to a jellyfish sting reduces or stops pain within six hours of treatment, or causes harm. One study withdrew a treatment (ammonia) because one participant had a chemical burn after this treatment. This finding relates directly to the types of jellyfish described in this section. These studies did not measure retreatment, switching to alternative study treatment, or skin reactions. These treatments are injected directly into the body (under the skin, into muscles, veins, or spine). In one study, people were treated in hospital after accidental stings by box jellyfish that cause Irukandji syndrome. Treatment included magnesium sulfate or a placebo (which looked like the treatment but had no active ingredients), which was given intravenously (directly into the bloodstream through a vein).
This study did not measure pain relief in a way that could be included in this review, and did not measure any of the outcomes that we were interested in. We have very little confidence in the available evidence. It is unclear whether any of the evaluated treatments reduce or stop pain, or provide other benefits after people have been stung by the jellyfish species in these studies. The findings in this review are only relevant to stings from a small number of jellyfish species that were in Australia, Malyasia, and Hawaii (USA). These findings therefore must not be used to decide treatment options for any other type of jellyfish. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2022.
We searched four computerised databases and five trial registers to 19 May 2021. We looked for all trials that randomly allocated participants to one treatment or another (randomised controlled trials, RCTs), and included adults (aged 18 years or older) with early NSCLC (stages I to III), confirmed by laboratory testing of a sample of the tumour. We found 11 RCTs, which included over 5000 participants who had received surgery or curative radiotherapy, and were randomly allocated to receive either immunotherapy or no further treatment. We found that giving immunotherapy, mainly vaccine-based (aiming to activate the host immune system to induce human immune response to tumour-specific antigens), after surgery or radiotherapy did not make people live longer. People who were given vaccine-based immunotherapy did not seem to experience more side effects than the others. We did not find results that could tell us whether the addition of immunotherapy improved quality of life. At the moment, there is no evidence to support or refute giving immunotherapy (mainly vaccine-based) to people with localised NSCLC (stages I to III). RCTs in progress are testing new, more promising immunotherapy drugs (e.g. checkpoint inhibitors). The evidence we found about overall survival and progression-free survival was of high and moderate quality, respectively. When we looked for evidence about how many participants lived to one, two, three, or five years, it was only moderate or low quality, because the RCTs were not very well done, and their results did not agree with each other. The evidence for both any and severe adverse events was of low quality.
Eight studies with 390,769 participants, mainly observational, were included in this systematic review. The aim of the studies reviewed was to determine an association of the intake of total flavonoids, and eight main flavonoid subclasses, with colorectal neoplasms including CRC and adenomas. The majority of the studies were of medium to high methodological quality. The evidence that intake of dietary flavonoids reduces the risk of colorectal neoplasms was conflicting, and could partly be explained due to difficulties in quantifying the intake of flavonoids. Therefore, the association of dietary flavonoids and prevention of colorectal neoplasms remains unproven.
This review included 19 studies involving over 310,000 women. Seven trials were conducted in Africa, six in Indonesia, two in Bangladesh, and one each in Nepal, China, India, UK and USA. Most of the trials were conducted in populations considered to be vitamin A deficient (except USA and UK). The overall risk of bias was low to unclear in most of the trials, and the body of evidence was moderate to high quality. The findings indicate that routine supplementation with vitamin A (either alone or in combination with other supplements) during pregnancy did not reduce mother or newborn baby deaths. There is good evidence that antenatal vitamin A supplementation does reduce maternal anaemia in women who live in areas where vitamin A deficiency is common or who are HIV-positive. The trials published so far did not report any side effects or adverse events. The available evidence suggests a reduction in maternal infection but these data are not of a high quality and further trials would be needed to confirm or refute this. Taking vitamin A supplements during pregnancy does not help to prevent maternal deaths (related to pregnancy) or perinatal or newborn baby deaths. Taking vitamin A supplements during pregnancy does not help to prevent other problems that can occur such as stillbirth, preterm birth, low birthweight of babies or newborn babies with anaemia. However, the risk of maternal anaemia, maternal infection and maternal night blindness is reduced.
This review of two randomized trials (RCTs) showed that continuous ultrasound applied in water to the dorsal and palmar aspects of the hand increased grip strength as compared with placebo. This benefit was not evident with combined therapy (exercise, wax bath, faradic hand baths). Ultrasound also produced a borderline increase in wrist dorsal flexion, decreased morning stiffness, and reduced the number of swollen and painful joints. The conclusions are limited by few studies, small sample size and limitations in study methodology.
We included four randomised controlled trials involving 543 women. The studies took place in the UK, Turkey, Egypt and Hong Kong, and the primary outcome in all studies was abnormal changes in the lining of the uterus. Three studies reported on the outcome of fibroids. Three studies reported on abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting. Two studies reported on breast cancer recurrence, and three studies reported on breast cancer-related death. The evidence is current to June 2020. This review suggests that the LNG-IUS probably slightly reduces the risk of endometrial polyps and endometrial hyperplasia over two to five years in women taking tamoxifen following breast cancer. The evidence suggests that if the incidence of endometrial polyps following endometrial surveillance alone is assumed to be 23.5%, the incidence following LNG-IUS plus endometrial surveillance would be between 3.8% and 10.7%. Evidence also suggests that if 2.8% of women who only had endometrial surveillance developed endometrial hyperplasia, the chance following LNG-IUS plus endometrial surveillance would be between 0.1% and 1.9%.
The LNG-IUS probably increases abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting. After one year, the evidence suggests that if the incidence of abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting following endometrial surveillance alone is assumed to be 1.7%, the incidence following LNG-IUS plus endometrial surveillance would be between 5.6% and 21.5%. After two years, if 4.2% of women who only had endometrial surveillance experienced abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting, between 4.4% and 23.9% of women who had both surveillance and LNG-IUS would be expected to experience this. However by five years of follow-up, no women in either group reported abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting.
We found insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion regarding the effect on incidence of endometrial cancer (a cancer originating in glandular tissue), fibroids, breast cancer recurrence, or breast cancer-related death. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be moderate because the studies only included a limited number of women and there were not many events. Larger studies are necessary to assess the effects of the LNG-IUS on the incidence of endometrial cancer, and the impact of the LNG-IUS on the risk of secondary breast cancer events.
We searched electronic databases up to February 2011, as well as trial registers, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles, for studies comparing diagnostic tests for people with suspected rotator cuff tears. Our review included 20 studies (1147 shoulders). Many studies had design flaws, which limited the reliability of their findings. We found that MRI, MRA and US may have similar accuracy for detecting the presence of full thickness tears. For identifying any tears (no distinction between partial or full thickness) or identifying partial thickness tears, MRI and US may also have similar accuracy. However, it appears that compared with US, MRI may be more sensitive in identifying partial thickness tears. With these results we can conclude that all three imaging tests (MRI, MRA and US) may help decisions regarding referral for surgery for people with suspected full thickness tears. Information on adverse effects of using these tests was not reported by the included studies.
We identified 10 randomised controlled trials with a total of 2361 participants that evaluated compression therapy (current until March 2017). We combined five trials to assess our main outcome - PTS. We found that people with DVT who wear elastic compression stockings are less likely to develop PTS, and that compression did not lead to reduced incidence of severe PTS. We found no clear differences in occurrence of pulmonary embolism (blockage of the artery in the lung) nor in reports of recurrent DVT. Compression in the acute phase of DVT compared with "no compression" treatment did not significantly lower PTS incidence. Thigh-length stockings did not provide better protection against development of PTS than knee-length stockings. One trial reported that wearing compression stockings for two years seemed to be superior to wearing them for one year in terms of PTS incidence. Compression treatment did not seem to improve quality of life, except during the first nine days after DVT, but we could draw no real conclusions regarding this outcome. Side effects included itching, erythema, and other forms of allergic reaction. The study investigators reported no serious adverse events and indicated that compliance with use of compression stockings was generally high but varied across studies. Although studies show a reduction in the number of people developing PTS, the quality of evidence is low because of considerable differences between studies and lack of or unclear risk of blinding due to clinical assessment scores. Overall, the included studies were of poor methodological quality.
This systematic review was designed to assess the effectiveness of such cognitive-behavioural interventions for preventing youth gang involvement. A three-part search strategy found no randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural interventions for gang prevention; four excluded studies examining the impact of Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) were of too poor a quality to be included in analysis. The only possible conclusions from this review, therefore, are the urgent need for additional primary evaluations of cognitive-behavioural interventions for gang prevention and the importance of high standards required of the research conducted to provide meaningful findings that can guide future programmes and policies.
We included 14 studies in this review, involving a total of 6641 participants. All studies lasted between two and 78 weeks. All people included in these studies had received a diagnosis of asthma. Trials included both men and women, and one study included children and young people.
All studies looked at VI and FF versus another medication or placebo. In all studies, the VI/FF combination was taken through a dry powder inhaler. We found that participants who received a combination of FF and VI therapy had improved lung function compared with those given placebo, but evidence was insufficient to permit any other conclusions because researchers attempted to answer too many different questions. Evidence was lacking on whether the combination of VI and FF therapy once-daily is better or worse than a twice-daily alternative. More studies are needed, so that we can gain a better understanding of the evidence overall. Overall, the evidence presented in this review is taken from well-designed studies at low risk of bias in terms of decisions on who received which treatment, blinding and how to report outcomes for participants who did not finish the study. However, because we were not able to combine results for many of our outcomes of interest, or because the outcome was rare, we judged the quality of the evidence overall to be low to moderate.
Thousands of people with schizophrenia have participated in studies and therefore we are reasonably sure that it is a potent antipsychotic drug and as good as similar older drugs. Most people taking it do experience adverse effects, but this also applies to other older drugs. Not enough comparisons with newer generations of drugs have been undertaken to be sure of how trifluoperazine compares to them.
We reviewed the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)/testosterone as an adjunctive therapy to standard antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia and found three relevant small, short studies. All trials compared antipsychotic drugs plus DHEA with antipsychotic drugs and placebo. Results are inconclusive, with most outcomes being either non-significant or contradictory and a much larger, conclusive study should be undertaken. Currently however, people with schizophrenia should only agree to take this experimental treatment within the context of a well designed experimental study. We found nothing in these studies to suggest that it should be used in routine care.
We included 12 studies involving 1016 women requiring surgery for gynaecological disease. Studies were at moderate to high overall risk of bias. Operations performed were hysterectomy (eight studies) and sacrocolpopexy (three studies). In addition, one trial examined surgical treatment for endometriosis, which included resection or hysterectomy. We are uncertain as to whether RAS or conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) has lower overall complication rates because the evidence gathered was of low certainty. The time taken to carry out the operation varied considerably among studies reporting this outcome, so results are difficult to interpret, and although the evidence suggested slightly shorter hospital stays with RAS (one-third of a day), we considered the evidence to be very uncertain and studies to be at high risk of bias.
For sacrocolpopexy procedures, overall evidence shows no clear differences in rates of any complications with RAS compared with CLS, but the evidence was of low certainty. Only one study reported postoperative complications, which were higher in the RAS group (low-certainty evidence). RAS was associated with an average increase in operating time of 40.53 minutes in the RAS group (low-certainty evidence), but these results probably are not reliable, as there was a lot of variation between studies. We found very low-certainty evidence suggesting there was little or no difference between RAS and CLS in terms of duration of hospital stay for this procedure.
Two small studies looked at hysterectomy using RAS versus open abdominal surgery; however, most findings were assessed as being too uncertain to draw any conclusions. Similarly, a study with data for 73 women looked at RAS versus CLS for surgery for endometriosis; women with endometriosis underwent procedures ranging from relatively minor endometrial resection through hysterectomy; many of the women included in this study had undergone previous surgery for their condition, and the sample size was insufficient to show potential differences between surgical techniques. Complication rates (during and after surgery) for RAS might be similar to those for CLS; however, the evidence is generally of low quality/certainty. Evidence on its use for gynaecological cancer surgery is more uncertain because we found no comparative evidence on cancer recurrence or survival after cancer surgery. As RAS depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon and is an expensive technology, evaluating its effectiveness and safety independently will present challenges.
We included randomised controlled trials that compared routine invasive strategies to conservative strategies in patients with UA and NSTEMI in the stent era. We searched the available literature up to 25 August 2015. We included eight studies with 8915 participants: five trials were in the review version published in 2010, and three were new trials. Of the included participants with UA and NSTEMI, there were 4545 in the invasive strategy arm and 4370 in the conservative strategy arm. Evidence failed to show appreciable risk reduction in all-cause mortality and death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) with routine invasive management strategy compared to conservative strategies. There was appreciable risk reduction in MI, refractory angina and re-hospitalisation with routine invasive strategies compared to conservative strategies, but this was associated with an increased risk of procedure-related MI and bleeding complications. The quality of the evidence in this review update ranged from low quality to moderate quality. Low quality evidence was as a result of serious risk of bias and uncertainty surrounding the effect, while moderate quality evidence was only due to serious risk of bias. The debate continues as to which strategy is better. The invasive strategy reduces the incidence of further chest pain or re-hospitalisation. Also, long-term follow-up from three studies suggests that it lowers the risk of a heart attack over the next three to five years. However, the invasive strategy also is associated with double the risk of heart attack during or soon after initial treatment, as well as an increased risk of bleeding. In summary, the published scientific research suggests that the invasive strategy may have particular benefit in those patients who are at high risk for recurrent events, and that patients at low risk for a recurrent event may even suffer harm from such an approach.
We wanted to find out if direct oral anticoagulants are useful and safe for treating people with DVT compared with conventional treatments. We searched for studies in which people with a confirmed DVT were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. These types of studies give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects. People in the experimental groups received an oral direct thrombin inhibitor or an oral factor Xa inhibitor, and their results were compared to the results of people given conventional anticoagulation. All participants were given long-term treatment of DVT (minimum duration of 3 months). After searching for relevant studies, we found 21 studies with 30,895 participants. We combined the data from the studies and found that there was no clear difference in the incidence of:
- recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT, pulmonary embolism, or both);
- recurrent DVT;
- pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs); or
- death
between people treated with oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitor compared to those given conventional anticoagulants.
Compared to conventional treatment, both direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors reduced the major bleeding which happened during the treatment of DVT. Our confidence in the evidence is generally moderate because few people overall experienced the outcomes. The evidence answered the question we addressed directly and the results of the studies were consistent. However, further studies are needed to explore how one direct oral anticoagulant compares with another. Future well-designed studies may also provide important evidence for post-thrombotic syndrome (a condition that can happen to people who have had a DVT of the leg, causing chronic pain, swelling and other symptoms in the leg) and quality of life. This review updates a previous Cochrane Review. The evidence is up to date to 1 March 2022. When treating people with a DVT, current evidence shows there is probably a similar effect between direct oral anticoagulants and conventional anticoagulants for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism, recurrent DVT, pulmonary embolism and death. Direct oral anticoagulants reduced major bleeding compared to conventional anticoagulation.
We included 10 studies involving 787 persons, with ages ranging from 31 to 62 years. Eight studies included people with primary as well as incisional ventral hernia, one study included people with umbilical (navel area) hernia only, and another study with incisional hernia only. Hernia size varied widely between studies. The number of included participants ranged from 40 to 199. Participant follow-up was mostly short (less than 12 months). The differences between the fixation techniques were small for our analysed outcomes. We could not find any difference between the use of tacks compared to sutures (stitches), the use of absorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable tacks, the use of absorbable tacks compared to absorbable sutures and the use of fibrin sealant compared to tacks. In addition, the combination of fixation techniques (sutures and tacks) or materials (absorbable and nonabsorbable) showed no advantage for recurrence, pain or other complications. The certainty of evidence for the main outcomes of recurrence and pain, as well as for complications, was very low or low. The main reason for this was a lack of sufficient data, due to the small number of included participants, and the small number of hernia recurrences. Furthermore, almost all studies were at moderate to high risk of bias, as the healthcare professionals involved were unblinded, i.e. aware of the interventions their patients received.
We searched six databases for relevant research. This is an update of a previously published review, and the date of the most recent search was February 2017. We found 78 studies on the effects of interventions aimed at family and carers with the goal of reducing children’s exposure to tobacco smoke. These studies included parents and other family members, child care workers, and teachers involved in the care and education of infants and young children (from birth to 12 years of age), and used a variety of interventions, including different kinds of counselling, brief advice, and educational materials. Only 26 studies reported that an intervention was successful in reducing children’s exposure to tobacco smoke. These studies used a range of interventions. Nine studies used more intensive counselling methods or motivational interviewing, but in other studies, these types of interventions were not effective. Of the 52 studies that did not show a significant reduction in child tobacco smoke exposure, 19 used intensive counselling methods or motivational interviewing. One study successfully reduced children's asthma symptoms by using motivational interviewing. This review does not show whether any particular interventions reduced parental smoking and child smoke exposure more effectively than others. The quality of evidence ranged from low to very low. Future studies should aim to provide evidence of higher quality by addressing study design problems, including more participants, and describing interventions in more detail.
This systematic review found no randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of opportunities provision for gang prevention. There is an urgent need for rigorous primary evaluations of gang prevention and intervention programmes to justify current programme funding and guide future interventions.
We looked at research trials of people with dementia doing art therapy, compared with usual care and other activities. We looked at effects of art therapy on memory and thinking, emotions, well-being, social behaviour and quality of life. We also looked at negative effects and costs of art therapy. We found two research studies with a total of 88 older people taking part. There were results for 60 people. One study compared groups doing art therapy or simple calculation activities over 12 weeks. The other study compared groups doing art therapy or recreational activities over 40 weeks. The evidence is current to October 2017. These two studies found no clear changes in memory or most other outcomes looked at when comparing art therapy to other activities. The studies were limited by many factors that reduced the quality of findings - considered 'very low' with well-known methods for evaluating this. Each study used different types of art therapy. This made it difficult to look at all the results together. One study had a high rate of people not completing the research trial. The studies included small numbers of people, which makes it difficult to be sure how accurate the findings are. This also makes it difficult to know if the effects will be the same in more people. Art therapy is difficult to test for its effects.
More research is needed on this topic. There is not enough information from research trials about the effects of art therapy for people with dementia. This review suggests ways to do this.
Our aim was to examine the effects (both harms and benefits) of psychological interventions for treating depression in young adults and adults with congenital heart disease. We updated the searches of the medical literature to March 2023. We selected studies that met our criteria, assessed the risk of bias for depression, compared the results of these studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on these studies (e.g. assessment methods and size of the sample). We found three studies, with a total of 480 participants with congenital heart disease, which looked at how psychological interventions (talking/counselling therapy) impacted depression. The psychological interventions lasted between 90 minutes and 3 months. These studies were conducted in Canada, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Studies were funded by grants from the National Research Council of the respective countries.
The results of our review suggest that a psychological intervention may help to reduce the symptoms of depression in adults with congenital heart disease. However, the type and length of the intervention varied between studies, so it may be possible that some interventions may make little or no difference to reducing depression. There were only three studies that met the criteria for the review, and the certainty of the evidence was low. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the impact of psychological interventions (talking/counselling therapy) on quality of life. This evidence is up to date to March 2023.
We found two studies including 1073 participants that compared the long-term effectiveness and side effects of tiotropium compared to ipratropium bromide. One trial was 12 weeks long and one was a year long. The people included in the studies had moderate to severe COPD (average forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 40% the predicted value).
Compared to ipratropium bromide, tiotropium treatment led to improved lung function, fewer COPD exacerbations, fewer hospital admissions (including those for exacerbations of COPD) and improved quality of life. Tiotropium appears to be safer with fewer adverse events, but there was no significant difference in deaths with ipratropium bromide when compared to tiotropium. Overall the evidence was of moderate to high quality. Tiotrpium is available in two different inhalers, Respimat and Handihaler. A recent large double-blind trial of the two delivery devices found no substantial difference in mortality using 2.5 µg or 5 µg of tiotropium via Respimat in comparison to 18 µg via Handihaler. Based on this review, tiotropium has more benefits than ipratropium bromide for people with stable moderate to severe COPD.
The review was current as of August 2015.
This is an update of a review published in 2009. New searches in March 2015 identified three new studies, making 18 studies with 3714 participants altogether, 1902 of whom were treated with diclofenac and 1007 with placebo. Diclofenac potassium is a rapidly absorbed formulation, and the 50 mg dose provided the largest amount on information. With this dose of this formulation, more than 6 in 10 (64%) participants had effective pain relief, compared with fewer than 2 in 10 (17%) with placebo (high quality evidence).
Adverse events occurred at similar rates with diclofenac and placebo in these single dose studies (moderate quality evidence). There were few serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events.
Diclofenac potassium represents a useful option in controlling acute pain.
In animal studies, the drug tirilazad appeared to reduce brain damage after SAH. We reviewed the evidence from randomised controlled trials of tirilazad in patients with SAH to see if it could reduce the risk of death or disability. The review did not show any evidence of benefit from tirilazad in patients with aneurysmal SAH.
This review found two small trials that compared the use of thyroid hormones to no treatment in infants with breathing problems in the first hours after birth. No benefit was found from use of these hormones on severity of breathing problems or complications that occurred as a result of these breathing problems. The effect on longer term development was not reported.
This review includes 10 trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo, and 70 observational studies in which adults were followed over time to determine whether their baseline selenium status was associated with their risk of cancer. The evidence is current to January 2017. All of the high-quality randomised trials reported no effect of selenium on reducing overall risk of cancer or risk of particular cancers, including the most investigated outcome - prostate cancer. Some trials unexpectedly suggested that selenium may increase risks of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities.
Observational studies have yielded inconsistent evidence of a possible effect of selenium exposure on cancer risk, with no evidence of a dose-response relation. When we pooled results of these studies, overall they suggested an inverse relation between cancer exposure and subsequent incidence of any cancer or some specific cancers, such as colon and prostate cancer. However, observational studies have major weaknesses. The selenium exposure status of participants could have been misclassified owing to limitations of the indicators of selenium exposure used, as well as to uncertainty regarding the particular selenium species contributing to overall exposure. In addition, unmeasured confounding from lifestyle or nutritional factors - a major and well-known source of bias in nutritional epidemiology studies of observational design - could have been present. Therefore, the internal validity of these studies is limited.
Currently, the hypothesis that increasing selenium intake may reduce cancer risk is not supported by epidemiological evidence. Additional research is needed to assess whether selenium may affect the risk of cancer in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds or nutritional status, and to determine how the various chemical forms of selenium compounds may have different effects on cancer risk.
This review found that exercise improves blood sugar control and that this effect is evident even without weight loss. Furthermore, exercise decreases body fat content, thus the failure to lose weight with exercise programmes is probably explained by the conversion of fat to muscle. Exercise improved the body's reaction to insulin and decreased blood lipids. Quality of life was only assessed in one study, which found no difference between the two groups. No significant difference was found between groups in blood levels of cholesterol or blood pressure. A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were assessed. These included 377 participants and compared groups that differed only with respect to an exercise programme intervention. The duration of the interventions in the studies ranged from eight weeks to one year. Two studies reported follow-up information, one at six months after the end of the six month exercise intervention and one at twelve months post-intervention. Generally, the studies were well-conducted, but blinding of outcome assessors was not reported and although all studies reported that randomisation was performed, few gave details of the method. 

No adverse effects with exercise were reported. The effect of exercise on diabetic complications was not assessed in any of the studies.
The relatively short duration of trials prevented the reporting of any significant long term complications or mortality. Another limitation was the small number of participants included in the analyses for adiposity, blood pressure, cholesterol, body's muscle and quality of life.
The review included two trials (up to August 2015) conducted in Spain and the USA, involving 1284 people with cataract. A total of 68 people were treated as day care surgery, while 598 stayed overnight in the hospital. The mean age of the participants was about 70 years and there were slightly more women than men. The studies were not funded by a drug company. The two studies in this review found that in developed countries at least, there was some evidence that day surgery for this type of cataract extraction may not only be cheaper but just as effective as hospitalisation and overnight stay for cataract extraction. Although the evidence on complications after surgery such as swelling of the cornea, leaking of the wound and temporary increased pressure within the eye was inconclusive, there appeared to be little differences in visual acuity and improvements in quality of life. One of the two studies showed limitations in study design and the way it was run, probably as it was an old study and reported in a less robust way. It provided fewer data for the review. The people included in the studies were representative for the group we were interested in.
We identified one study that included a limited number of patients comparing eculizumab with placebo. The study was published in 2006, and was conducted in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia with 26 weeks of follow-up. No patients died during the performance of this single study. The study showed a moderate improvement in the quality of life in patients treated with eculizumab. In addition, eculizumab reduced fatigue and the number of patients that withdrew from the study for any reason. Eculizumab showed a higher proportion of patients with transfusion independence. There was no difference between eculizumab and placebo in terms of adverse events, probably due to the low rate of events observed during the study. The trial did not assess other relevant outcomes such as overall survival, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia, or development or recurrence of aplastic anemia on treatment. The confidence in the results is moderate to low. The study had limitations in its design and execution, and was sponsored by the manufacturer of the drug that was assessed. Moreover, the limited number of patients included in the study led to imprecise results. Larger studies should provide more information about the effect of eculizumab in patients with paroxsymal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
This plain language summary is current as of May 2014.
There have been surprisingly few investigations of treatments for SH in children and adolescents, despite the size of this problem in many countries. We found positive effects of DBT-A on repetition of SH. There is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of individual CBT-based psychotherapy, MBT-A, group-based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions in preventing repetition of SH. We recommend further trials of DBT-A. Given the evidence for its benefit for adults who engage in SH, individual CBT-based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents. Given the extent of SH in children and adolescents, greater attention should be paid to the development and evaluation of specific therapies for this population.
We considered only randomised controlled trials in this Cochrane Rapid Review, as they offer the most reliable results. This review is current to 20 June 2018. We found only one randomised study for our question. Participants included in this trial had metastatic (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) or advanced cancer that could not be removed by surgery, that had come back or worsened with other chemotherapy.
We found that pembrolizumab probably improves overall survival a little (evidence of moderate certainty). It may improve quality of life slightly (low certainty evidence).
Pembrolizumab may have little or not effect on the time for the cancer to worsen or advance (low certainty evidence). It probably improves treatment response as seen on X-ray scans such as computer tomography (moderate certainty of evidence).
Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on deaths resulting from the treatment itself (low certainty evidence) but may result in fewer patients stopping treatment due to unwanted side effects (low certainty evidence). It may also cause less serious side effects.
These conclusions are based on a single trial paid for by the company that makes pembrolizumab. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low.
The three included trials provided some weak and unreliable evidence for the effectiveness of Beconase® and flunisolide used topically in the nose for the treatment of intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children. The review authors concluded that until more research is available, decisions on the use of topical steroids should be guided by the physician's clinical experience and patients' individual circumstances and preferences.
We found two randomized controlled trials (95 adult participants) and one non-randomized controlled study (17 children aged at least four weeks) conducted in Portugal, Canada, and the United States. We rated the two randomized trials as being of unclear quality and the non-randomized study as being low quality. The largest randomized trial (75 participants) found a 83% success rate for extubation with mechanically- and manually-assisted cough used in combination, compared with 53% in the control group (extubation success over 1½ times more likely) (very low-quality evidence). The time spent on a ventilator was six days less in people using mechanically- and manually-assisted cough (very low-quality evidence). No participants died in this trial.
Complications were reported by the two randomized trials. One person receiving mechanically-assisted cough experienced a prolonged drop in blood pressure; another person receiving breathstacking and suctioning in addition to manually-assisted cough experienced a prolonged rise in blood pressure. In one trial, following removal of the breathing tube, more people in the group not receiving mechanically-assisted cough experienced secretion retention, a drop in oxygen levels, and needed the breathing tube to be reinserted (nine people compared with two, very low-quality evidence).
The non-randomized study reported that the breathing tube could be removed in all of the six children in the group receiving interventions to assist with coughing. In this non-randomized study, death was only reported for children receiving a cough-promoting technique. One child died, but this was not thought to be related to the cough technique. This study did not report adverse events associated with assisted coughing. No included study evaluated a single cough-promoting technique in isolation. The two randomized trials combined manually-assisted cough with either mechanical assistance (MI-E) or breathstacking, and the non-randomized study used all three methods. Very low-quality evidence from single trial findings suggests that cough-promoting techniques might increase successful removal of the breathing tube and decrease the time spent on mechanical ventilation, while not causing harm. The limited participant numbers made it difficult to determine the likelihood of harms.
We wanted to find out if remotely-delivered psychological therapies:
• improve pain, disability, and quality of life (i.e. well-being across life as a whole);
• cause any unintended harmful effects. We searched for studies that compared remotely-delivered psychological therapies with usual care or non-psychological treatments (such as education about pain). We looked at study results at the end of treatment and up to one year after.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 32 studies that included 4924 people with a range of chronic pain conditions, such as back pain, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis. Average ages ranged from 24 to 67 years. Where those taking part were followed up after treatment ended, this follow-up was between 3 and 12 months later; we did not include results collected after 12 months. Studies included in the review were carried out across 11 countries, with over half attributable to Sweden (9), the USA (6), and Australia (5). All studies were funded by government grants or charities, bar one study that did not state its funding source.
Studies investigated treatments based on the psychological therapies of CBT (25 studies) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; 7 studies). One of the CBT studies included an additional group who received a positive psychology intervention. All therapies were delivered online, except one study using a smartphone app. Our results only speak to therapy delivered by the Internet due to the lack of alternative forms of remote delivery in the studies.
• Compared to usual treatment (i.e. the standard support typically available), online CBT probably reduces pain and may reduce disability slightly. It is unclear whether online CBT improves quality of life or has unintended harmful effects.
• Compared to non-psychological treatments for pain (e.g. education, online discussion boards), online CBT also probably reduces pain slightly. However, it probably makes little to no difference to quality of life, may make little or no difference to disability, and it is unclear whether it has unintended harmful effects.
• The benefits of online CBT compared to usual treatment are probably no longer present at 3 to 12 months after treatment ends. We do not know if this finding is also the case when compared to a non-psychological treatment because the effects are unclear.
It is unclear whether other psychological therapies (such as ACT) lead to improvements because, overall, we are very uncertain of the available results. We have moderate confidence that pain is reduced by online CBT by the end of treatment, but this improvement is not present 3 to 12 months later. In addition, we have moderate confidence in our finding of no benefits of online CBT for disability and quality of life at follow-up. However, we have little to very little confidence in our findings for ACT.
Three main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. First, some of the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about their results. Second, where there were small numbers of studies for an outcome, the evidence did not cover a range of pain conditions, so we cannot assume that those findings would be the same across all types of chronic pain. Finally, the results were sometimes inconsistent across studies. The evidence is up to date to 29 June 2022.
We wanted to find out if universal, selective and indicated interventions delivered in education settings reduced:
• self-harm;
• suicidal Ideation (thinking about suicide); and
• hopelessness.
We also wanted to know if these interventions were acceptable to young people. We measured this by the number of people who did not complete the study (dropouts).
We explored whether studies measured outcomes that young people thought were important, including coping skills, and aspects of an environment that make them safe. We searched for any kind of measurement of coping skills and safe environment. We searched for studies that examined universal, selective and indicated interventions designed to reduce self-harm or prevent suicide in any education setting. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods, sample sizes and other biases evident in the study procedures. We found 51 studies with 36,414 young people. Twenty-seven studies were conducted in secondary schools, one in middle school, one in primary school, 19 in universities, one in medical school, and one across education and community settings. None were conducted in alternative education or technical training school settings. Studies compared the interventions with no intervention, being on a waiting list, or other approaches, such as exercise or healthy eating.
Overall, there was little evidence indicating the impact of universal, selective or indicated interventions for any outcomes. None of the studies on universal approaches provided data on self-harm. It is not clear whether selective and indicated interventions may slightly reduce self-harm compared to comparison groups. There might be a small reduction in non-suicidal self-injury (injuring yourself without any intention to die) for indicated interventions when compared to the comparison group. The evidence for the acceptability of the intervention showed that indicated participants might be more likely to drop out from indicated interventions when compared to control but showed no difference for universal or selective interventions. There might be a decrease in suicidal ideation and hopelessness for those who receive indicated interventions compared to control but probably little to no effect for universal and selective interventions. There was a wide range of measurement of coping skills and safe environments, but there was limited information to indicate any improvement. Young people in the trials were probably aware of what intervention they received and not all the studies provided data about self-harm and other outcomes that we were interested in. There were few really large studies, which are important for understanding how interventions impact prevention.
Unfortunately, our measurement of dropouts was not useful in the context of education settings, where it was often not clear whether young people had dropped out or were not at school that day. The evidence is current to April 2023.
Although we included 17 trials, involving 3212 patients, in this review, the risk of bias was so high that the evidence did not support using any Chinese herbal preparation(s) for the common cold. Well-designed clinical trials are required.
We looked for trials that compared antihistamines (either oral or topical) in addition to a topical nasal steroid with a topical nasal steroid alone in children who had allergic rhinitis. We wanted to know whether adding antihistamines (oral or topical) in the therapy of children with allergic rhinitis who already use topical nasal steroids would have additional benefits for them. We found one trial that had been carried out in children comparing oral antihistamines in addition to topical nasal steroids with topical nasal steroids alone but it did not provide sufficient data to draw any conclusions. Most of the trials focused only on adults or included a small number of children. Unfortunately, the trials which included children along with adults did not report whether there were any differences in the effect of treatment or adverse effects in children in comparison with adults. We are therefore unable to draw a conclusion as to whether or not this combination therapy has beneficial effect in children with allergic rhinitis or whether the benefits are acceptable in terms of the adverse effects.
The primary aim of this review is to evaluate the effects, on labour and birth outcomes, of care in an alternative institutional birth setting compared with care in a conventional hospital labour ward. We included ten trials involving 11,795 women. We found no trials of freestanding birth centres. When compared to conventional institutional settings, alternative settings were associated with reduced likelihood of medical interventions, increased likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth, increased maternal satisfaction, and greater likelihood of continued breastfeeding at one to two months postpartum, with no apparent risks to mother or baby. Unfortunately, in several trials, the design features of the alternative setting were confounded by differences in the organizational models of care (including separate staff and more continuity of caregiver in the alternative setting), and thus it is not possible to draw conclusions about the independent effects of the design of the birth environment. We conclude that women and policy makers should be informed about the benefits of institutional settings which focus on supporting normal labour and birth.
This evidence is current to 4 December 2015. We found 39 trials that recruited 16,082 participants testing 22 different multi-component interventions, medications or anaesthetic interventions, compared to usual care, placebo, or different interventions. We found strong evidence that multi-component interventions can prevent delirium in both medical and surgical settings and less robust evidence that they reduce the severity of delirium. Evidence about their effect on the duration of delirium is inconclusive.
There is evidence that monitoring the depth of anaesthesia can reduce the occurrence of delirium after general anaesthetic.
We found no clear evidence that a range of medications or other anaesthetic techniques or procedures are effective in preventing delirium. There is moderate-quality evidence to indicate that multi-component interventions reduce the incidence of delirium. The evidence supports implementing multi-component delirium prevention interventions into routine care for patients in hospital.
There is moderate-quality evidence that monitoring depth of general anaesthesia can be used to prevent delirium postoperatively.
The quality of the evidence for a range of medications or other anaesthetic techniques or procedures for preventing delirium is poor (because of the small number of trials and the variable quality of trial methods), and cannot be used to inform changes to practice. None.
Results from nine trials involving 956 women found that both psychosocial (e.g., peer support, non-directive counselling) and psychological (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy) interventions appear to be effective in reducing symptoms of postpartum depression. The long-term benefits are unknown. Larger trials evaluating psychosocial and psychological treatments for postpartum depression are needed to provide clear conclusions about specific intervention benefits.
Currently, there are no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to support the role of distal aortic perfusion in TAAA surgery for prevention of neurological injury. Observational studies from experienced surgical centres suggest a potential benefit with the use of distal aortic perfusion as sole adjunct or in combination with CSF drainage. This will need to be validated in future RCTs to compare distal aortic perfusion with another adjunct against other adjuncts without use of distal perfusion during TAAA repair. Randomised controlled trials are not always feasible in this type of surgery based on ethical grounds.
One study compared PLD plus carbo given to women every three weeks versus the standard treatment (paclitaxel (PAC)/carbo every three weeks), and the other added PLD to the standard treatment and compared it with standard treatment only (the latter study also included other treatments not relevant to this review). These studies spanned three years and included 820 and 4100 women, respectively. Most women in these studies had advanced cancer and had undergone surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible.
Key findings
Women receiving the PLD/carbo treatment and those given the standard treatment survived for a similar period, but PLD/carbo caused more women to experience low blood counts (anaemia and low platelets) that often led to a delay in treatment or the need to stop treatment. However, PLD/carbo caused far fewer women to experience hair loss and neuropathy (nerve damage causing symptoms such as tingling, numbness, pain, loss of sensation and/or coordination), and so it might help women who find these side effects unacceptable or intolerable. We concluded that three-weekly PLD/carbo is a reasonable alternative to standard platinum-based treatment for newly diagnosed EOC, but more research is needed to establish the safest and most effective dosage and dose frequency.
Adding PLD to standard treatment (PAC/carbo) every six weeks did not help women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer survive longer and was associated with worse effects on blood counts that increased the chance of infection; therefore this triple drug treatment cannot be recommended.
Quality of the evidence
We considered the evidence related to survival of women after they are treated with PLD/carbo or PAC/carbo, and the evidence related to adverse drug effects to be of high quality.
The review of studies identified four trials involving 666 women. The Joel-Cohen incision showed better outcomes than the Pfannenstiel incision in terms of less fever for women, less postoperative pain, less blood loss, shorter duration of surgery and shorter hospital stay. However, the trials did not assess possible long-term problems associated with different surgical techniques.
From analysis of 7 studies, which included 392 participants, we found that this treatment reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90%, a consistent finding between studies. Venom immunotherapy also significantly improves the quality of life of people who have had a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by reducing anxiety and possible limitation of activities caused by fear of insects. However, almost 1 in 10 people treated with venom immunotherapy during the trials had an allergic reaction to their treatment. We were unable to find out whether venom immunotherapy prevents fatal allergic reactions to insect stings, because these are so rare. The decision whether to start venom immunotherapy depends on an accurate diagnosis, followed by careful assessment of a person's risk of having another allergic reaction to a sting, the degree to which the insect sting allergy affects their quality of life, and the risk of an allergic reaction to their treatment.
We wanted to find out if cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day is as safe, effective, and cost-effective as having surgery on both eyes on different days. We searched for studies that looked at outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We also searched for studies that looked at the balance between costs and outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS (cost-effectiveness). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 14 studies that involved 276,260 people (7384 who had ISBCS and 268,876 who had DSBCS). The studies were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Most studies lasted for around three months. - Endophthalmitis: the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may make little to no difference in the occurrence of endophthalmitis in one eye (up to six weeks after surgery). None of the studies reported endophthalmitis in both eyes, but this event is most likely too rare to be detected by these studies.
- Refractive outcomes: there is probably little to no difference in refractive outcomes at one to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS.
- Other complications: there may be little to no difference in other complications up to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results.
- Costs: the economic studies in this review reported lower costs for ISBCS compared to DSBCS. One study reported that ISBCS is cost-effective compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results.
- Best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; vision with spectacle correction if needed): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may have little to no effect on BCDVA at one to three months after surgery, but we are very uncertain about the results.
- PROMs (measured in questionnaires): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) probably makes little to no difference in PROMs at one to three months after surgery. Overall, we had moderate to very little confidence in the evidence (endophthalmitis: little confidence, refractive outcomes: little to moderate confidence, complications: not confident, costs: little to no confidence, BCDVA: not confident, and PROMs: moderate confidence).
Our confidence is limited because:
- the evidence on endophthalmitis was based on few cases of endophthalmitis;
- the studies assessed complications in different ways;
- there were not enough studies to be certain about refractive outcomes and complications;
- studies on costs reported costs for only one hospital and included different funding sources;
- the studies assessed BCDVA in different ways and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results;
- there were concerns regarding the possibility that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting, and not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in (most outcomes). The evidence is up-to-date to 11 May 2021.
In total we found 76 studies recruiting 13,029 stroke survivors within one year of their stroke. There was a wide age range. About half the studies required participants to have depression to enter the trial. The duration, drug, and dose varied between studies. However, only six of these studies were at low risk of bias; the participants in these studies did not have to be depressed to enter the study, and they were all recruited soon after their stroke. When we combined data from these six studies at low risk of bias, SSRIs did not reduce disability or dependency. SSRIs reduced the risk of future depression by about a quarter, but led to a slight increase in the risk of seizures and also increased the risk of bone fractures. The evidence is current until January 2021. We are very confident that the results are reliable for the effect on disability, dependency and bone fractures, and moderately confident about the effect on seizure risk.
We included three trials (total of 70 participants aged between 8 and 46 years) in the review.
Two trials compared vitamin K to a control. In the first trial all 18 people taking part (aged 13 to 35 years) were given 5 mg oral vitamin K supplement once a week or nothing for a total duration of one month and then they swapped to the other group for another month. Unfortunately, we could not analyse the data from this trial because the investigators did not report data just from the first part of the trial (only from the end of the trial when everyone taking part had been in both groups), so we could not tell if the effects were due to supplements or no supplements. In the second trial a total of 38 people aged 16 to 45 years took part. They were given either 10 mg vitamin K or placebo (a dummy supplement not containing any vitamin K) every day for 12 months, but the investigators did not state how many people were in each group so we could not analyse the results.
In the third trial (14 children aged 8 to 18 years old) participants were given oral vitamin K supplements, half of them at a dose of 1 mg every day and the other half were given 5 mg every day for one month. No trial in either comparison reported our primary outcomes of blood clotting and quality of life or the secondary measures of nutrition and adverse events.
Vitamin K versus control
Only the 12-month trial reported on the primary outcome of bone formation; we are very uncertain whether vitamin K supplementation has any effect on bone mineral density measured at the hip or lower back (very low-quality evidence). Both trials reported an increase in vitamin K levels in the blood and a decrease in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels (this is an indicator of the risk of hip fracture). The four-week trial also reported that levels of proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA) dropped and returned to normal levels, but due to the very low-quality evidence we are not certain that this is due to supplementation.
High-dose versus low-dose vitamin K
The trial reported that while vitamin K levels improved there did not seem to be any difference between the high-dose and low-dose groups. There also did not seem to be any difference in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels (very low-quality evidence). The overall quality of the evidence was judged to be very low due to risks of bias in the design of all trials and the low numbers of participants.
We wanted to find out if using certain medicines was better than using other medicines or no medicines to reduce:
• the number of tries for a successful spinal tap in newborn infants;
• the total number of attempts;
• pain and discomfort during a spinal tap in newborn infants;
• episodes of bradycardia;
• episodes of desaturation; and
• episodes of apnea. We searched for studies that looked at using certain medicines compared with using other medicines or no medicines in newborn infants undergoing spinal tap. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found three studies that involved 206 newborn infants undergoing spinal tap. It is unclear whether painkillers applied to the skin (topical anesthetics), compared to no medicine, have an effect on the number of successful spinal taps on the first try, the number of attempts per successful spinal tap, episodes of bradycardia, episodes of desaturation, and episodes of apnea.
Topical anesthetics compared to placebo (dummy medicine) may reduce the pain experienced by newborn infants by 15% to 20%.
There are still three large ongoing studies assessing the effects of other medicines, but their results are not yet published. We also listed three studies as awaiting classification because we do not have enough information to include or exclude them. We have little confidence in the evidence about pain because the studies used different measures to measure pain.
We are not confident in the evidence for all the other results because there are too few studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were given. Finally, not all the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.
The evidence is current to March 2015. We included 32 randomised controlled trials of a wide variety of different commercially available culture media in women undergoing IVF or ICSI. Sixteen studies randomised women (total 3666), three randomised cycles (total 1018) and twelve randomised oocytes (over 15,230). Most studies (22/32) failed to report their source of funding. No two studies compared the same culture media. Only seven studies reported our primary outcome of live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and they found no good evidence of a difference between the media compared. A single study found low-quality evidence that for day three embryo transfer, Quinn's Advantage may be associated with higher rates than G5, but this study was available only as an abstract and the methods used were not clearly reported. With regard to adverse effects, three studies reported multiple pregnancies and six studies reported miscarriage. None of them found any evidence of a difference between the culture media used. None of the studies reported on the health of offspring. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific culture medium. Properly designed and executed randomised trials are necessary. There was very low-quality evidence for nearly all comparisons, the main limitations being imprecision and poor reporting of study methods.
All 24 included studies were randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). Sixteen studies compared the long-acting insulin glargine to NPH insulin and eight studies compared the long-acting insulin detemir to NPH insulin. In these studies, 3419 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomised to insulin glargine and 1321 people to insulin detemir. The duration of the studies ranged from 24 weeks to 5 years. The different insulins reduced HbA1c by about the same amount.
Treatment with insulin glargine or insulin detemir instead of NPH insulin resulted in fewer people with hypoglycaemia. Treatment with insulin detemir reduced the risk of serious hypoglycaemia. However, serious hypoglycaemia occurred only rarely in the studies, in fewer than one in 100 people treated with insulin detemir and in about one in 100 people treated with NPH insulin. Approximately one in 100 people treated with insulin detemir instead of NPH insulin benefited.
Information on diabetes-related complications (such as heart disease, renal disease, damage to the retina of the eyes and amputations), death from any cause and health-related quality of life was scarce. When available, study results did not suggest clear differences between insulin analogues and NPH insulin.
There was no clear difference between insulin analogues and NPH insulin for side effects or weight gain.
None of the included studies reported on socioeconomic effects (such as costs of the intervention, absence from work, medication consumption). In the studies, very low blood glucose and HbA1c target values were set. However, doctors often recommend higher targets for people with a long history of type 2 diabetes, who have had a heart attack or stroke, or who are old. With higher target values, hypoglycaemia occurs less frequently and more people need to be treated with insulin analogues instead of NPH insulin to prevent hypoglycaemia in one person. Therefore, study results are only applicable to people who are treated to such low blood glucose target values.
In many studies, an adequate adjustment of NPH insulin was not possible. However, doctors will do that in daily practice. Therefore, a further decrease in the benefit of insulin analogues is expected.
Treatment in all but one study lasted for 12 months or less. However, diabetes-related complications usually only develop over many years. Thus, most studies were unable to answer the important question whether treatment with different insulin preparations has different effects on diabetes-related complications. This means that potentially important differences between insulin analogues and NPH insulin were not detected.
All studies had problems in the way they were conducted.
The aim of this review was to see how effective palliative care interventions in care homes are, and to describe the outcome measures used in the studies. We found only three suitable studies (735 participants), all from the USA. There was little evidence that interventions to improve palliative care for older people in care homes improved outcomes for residents. One study found that palliative care increased bereaved family members' perceptions of the quality of care and another found lower discomfort for residents with dementia who were dying. There were problems with both of these findings. Two studies found that palliative care improved some of the ways in which care was given in the care home, however, we do not know if this resulted in better outcomes for residents. There is a need for more high quality research, particularly outside the USA.
The two small studies in this review suggest that Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) may be as effective as gestrinone and may be more effective than danazol in relieving endometriosis-related pain, with fewer side effects than experienced with conventional treatment. However, the two trials included in this review were small and of limited quality so these findings must be interpreted cautiously. Better quality randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate a possible role for CHM in the treatment of endometriosis.
The review, however, looks at only eight studies. The methods of most of these studies were considered poor and there was no definitive description of crisis intervention or crisis care for studies included before 2006, meaning there was a lack of focus on crisis care in its pure form. Most studies excluded service users with alcohol or drug misuse, and those who were a danger of being harmful to themselves or others. The authors of the review suggest more studies are needed to create a stronger evidence base. Crisis care may be currently delivered without sound and good quality evidence. For example, no data or information were available on carer input, concordance or the willingness of service users to take medication and the number of relapses experienced by service users. Finally, despite reports of staff 'burn-out', staff satisfaction with crisis care was not assessed.
This plain language summary has been prepared by Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation (. http://mcpin.org/).
We found one published randomised controlled trial with 2001 participants with localised skin cancer who had undergone removal of the primary tumour and were then randomised to receive SLNB or observation. Participants testing positive for cancer cells in the sentinel lymph node then underwent CLND. Participants in the observation group underwent removal of the lymph nodes only on disease recurrence. The study did not report on our primary outcome of interest (overall survival), but it did report on our secondary outcomes of disease-specific survival (time to death only from melanoma), disease-free survival (time to first melanoma recurrence at any site), and recurrence. Although the authors of the one included study did not report the primary outcome of overall survival, we were able to calculate it from data they included in their report appendix which showed no benefit of SLNB for people with intermediate or thick melanomas. Our one included study also did not report any difference in disease-specific survival for participants who underwent SLNB or observation. Disease-free survival was better in the SLNB treatment group. However, recurrence of the melanoma at a distant site in the body occurred more frequently in participants in the SLNB group than in those in the observation group. We assessed the quality of the evidence for this trial as low for the above outcomes. As indicated by the results of this one included study, there is no clear evidence at present to recommend that SLNB, followed by CLND. is a better means of improving overall or melanoma-specific survival than observation.
We wanted to find out whether motivational interviewing is better than no treatment or other forms of treatment at helping people to reduce or stop substance use. We also wanted to find out if motivational interviewing affects people's willingness to change and whether they stay in treatment. We looked for studies involving people who used substances such as alcohol or drugs. In the studies, people were divided by chance into a motivational interviewing group and a 'control' group that received either no treatment, regular treatment, assessment and feedback, or another active treatment.
Regular treatment involved sharing screening results, advising people to stop using alcohol/drugs, and providing educational materials. Assessment and feedback involved giving people relevant reading material and the chance to ask questions, but no counselling. Other active treatments varied; providing an educational programme about drugs and alcohol is a typical example.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 93 studies that involved 22,776 people with substance use. The largest study involved 1726 people and the smallest involved 25 people. The studies were conducted in countries around the world; most were in the USA (72). In most studies (30), one motivational interviewing session was conducted. There were also studies in which more sessions were conducted, up to 9 sessions. Session durations varied, from as little as 10 minutes to as long as 148 minutes per session.
The results show that motivational interviewing may make little to no difference to substance use compared with regular treatment or another active intervention. However, in the short term, motivational interviewing may reduce substance use compared with no treatment. At medium- and long-term follow-up, motivational interviewing probably reduces substance use slightly compared with assessment and feedback. It is unclear whether motivational interviewing has an effect on willingness to change and staying in treatment. We have moderate to no confidence in the evidence because of concerns about how some of the studies were conducted. The results were very inconsistent across the different studies, and 18 of the studies involved fewer than 100 people. The certainty of the research forces us to be careful about our conclusions; new research may change them. The evidence is current to November 2022.
The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out how well laser trabeculoplasty works as a treatment for open-angle glaucoma. This review compared laser treatment (laser trabeculoplasty) with topical medication (eye drops) and surgery (trabeculectomy). Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. Cochrane researchers found 40 studies. These studies were mainly from Europe and the USA.
The results were as follows:
•   Different studies found different effects on eye pressure when comparing laser trabeculoplasty with eye drops. Older studies were more likely to show a benefit of laser trabeculoplasty which may be because the eye drops in these older studies did not work as well as modern eye drops (low-certainty evidence). Three studies showed a benefit of trabeculoplasty over eye drops for avoiding visual field progression at 24 months (argon) and 48 months (selective) (moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded for risk bias).
•   Harmful effects were more common in the laser trabeculoplasty group and included more cases where the iris was stuck to the edge of the drainage mechanism inside the eye (peripheral anterior synaechiae) but this was seen only with older types of laser (argon) trabeculoplasty (low-certainty evidence).
•   People receiving laser trabeculoplasty may be more likely to have pressure in the eye that is too high compared with people who had surgery (trabeculectomy) (low-certainty evidence).
•   Surgery (trabeculectomy) may increase the risk of cataract compared with laser (very low-certainty evidence).
•   A number of studies compared different types of laser (argon, selective, diode, excimer, pattern scanning, titanium-sapphire, and micropulse) but with inconclusive results. Some of the studies were not masked and were not large enough to provide a reliable answer to the question. There have been changes over time in both laser and eye drops which meant that, for some outcomes, there were different effects in different studies. Cochrane Review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 28 October 2021.
We identified 10 studies (nine trials and one follow-up study) up to December 2014. In total, the studies involved over 1100 primary care doctors and around 492,000 patients. The intervention was different in each study. Six of the studies involved training clinicians (mostly primary care doctors) in communication skills that are needed to facilitate shared decision making. In three studies, as well as training doctors in these skills, patients were also given written information about antibiotics for acute respiratory infections. All included trials received funding from government sources. No studies declared a conflict of interest. Interventions that aim to facilitate shared decision making significantly reduce antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections in primary care, without a decrease in patients' satisfaction with the consultation, or an increase in repeat consultations for the same illness. There was not enough information to decide whether shared decision making affects other clinically adverse secondary outcomes, measures of clinician and patient involvement in sharing decision making, or antibiotic resistance. We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate or low for all outcomes.
We found 18 studies including a total of 2268 people: 12 included adults, five included children and one included individuals from both age groups. Most people included in the studies had mild to moderate persistent asthma, and studies generally lasted between three and 12 months. People in the intervention group were given one of a variety of technologies to record and share their symptoms (text messaging, Web systems or phone calls) and were compared with a group of people who received usual care, or a control group. We could not tell whether people in the telemonitoring groups had a higher or lower chance than people in the control group of having attacks that would require a course of oral steroids, a visit to the emergency department or a hospital stay. No reports described other potential harms of home telemonitoring. Studies used lots of different types of technology, and we couldn't tell whether some were better than others. Our confidence in the results ranged from moderate to very low, meaning that additional studies are likely to change some of these results and may influence how much we believe them.
Using technology to monitor people with asthma from home may offer benefits over usual care for overall quality of life, but the effect was small, and studies did not agree with each other. These interventions may provide benefits for lung function, but lots of people dropped out of the studies, so we couldn't be sure.
We searched for evidence on 11 May 2021. This updated review now includes 116 randomised controlled studies, of which 103 trials have contributed to the analyses, from 42 countries and involved 98,816 women and their babies. Some 55% of the women were from high-income countries, 37% from middle-income countries and 8% from low-income countries.
In this update of the review, we grouped interventions into two different categories. The first group, 'breastfeeding only', were interventions that only contained breastfeeding support. In the second group, breastfeeding support was one part of a larger intervention that also aimed to provide other health benefits for the mother or her infant (e.g. vaccinations, new baby care). We have called these 'breastfeeding plus' interventions.
Overall, these trials showed that it is probable that fewer women who received a ‘breastfeeding only’ support intervention stopped exclusively breastfeeding at all time points up to and including six months.  The effect was largest from 4-6 weeks to 3-4 months where we estimate that 17% and 19% fewer women would probably stop exclusively breastfeeding. The effect was smaller at six months where we estimate 10% fewer women would probably stop exclusively breastfeeding.
The evidence also suggests that women receiving ‘breastfeeding only’ support were probably less likely to stop any breastfeeding at time points up to and including six months. Again, the effect was largest from 4-6 weeks to 3-4 months where we estimate that 12% and 13% less women would probably stop any breastfeeding.  At six months we estimate that 7% less women would probably stop breastfeeding. There were not enough studies to show if ‘breastfeeding only’ support interventions could reduce the number of women who stop any breastfeeding at either nine months or 12 months.
For women who received 'breastfeeding plus' interventions the evidence is less clear. Women receiving ‘breastfeeding plus’ support may be 27% less likely to stop exclusive breastfeeding at 4-6 weeks (very low-certainty evidence).  Similarly, the evidence suggests that 21% fewer women may stop exclusive breastfeeding at six months. The effect on any breastfeeding was smaller where we estimate that 6% less women probably stopped any breastfeeding at six months. It remains unclear if 'breastfeeding plus' interventions reduce the number of women who stop any or exclusive breastfeeding at the other time points examined.
There was a lack of clear evidence on the factors that may help women breastfeed for longer. However, a specific schedule of four to eight contacts may help increase the number of women exclusively breastfeeding at 4-6 weeks or six months when receiving a 'breastfeeding only intervention'.
For ‘breastfeeding only’ support interventions, we generally judged the evidence to be of moderate certainty. This means that we are moderately confident in our findings.  For ‘breastfeeding plus’ support interventions the quality of the evidence was more mixed and the certainty ranged from moderate to very low. Providing women with extra organised support helps them breastfeed their babies for longer. Breastfeeding support may be more helpful if it has 4-8 scheduled visits. There does not appear to be a difference in who provides the support (i.e. professional or non-professional) or how it is provided (face-to-face, phone, digital technologies or combinations). Indeed, different kinds of support may be needed in different geographical locations to meet the needs of the people within that locality. Further work is needed to identify components of the effective interventions and to deliver interventions on a larger scale.
Seventeen studies compared mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab to a placebo in about 7600 people with asthma, most with severe disease. We summarised the results as they related to the occurrence of asthma attacks requiring additional treatment, quality of life, breathing tests, effects on a blood biomarker (the numbers of a type of inflammatory cell called eosinophils), and unwanted effects. We found that participants with severe asthma, who had high numbers of eosinophils in their blood, benefited from taking mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab through reduced asthma attacks. There were small improvements in quality of life and breathing tests, but these may be too small to be detected by patients. We agree with international guidelines that say that these medicines can be added to standard treatment for people with severe asthma. Further research is needed to clarify some aspects, such as how to assess treatment response and how long to give treatment for. The evidence included in this review is provided by very well-designed studies. We are confident that participants in the studies were randomly placed into different treatment groups, that neither they nor the study team were aware of the treatment they were receiving, and that the small number who did not complete the study did not affect the findings.
This plain language summary is up to date as of 7 February 2022.
Evidence from poor quality, small trials, suggests that superficial and partial thickness burns heal more quickly with silicon-coated nylon, silver containing dressings and biosynthetic dressings than with silver sulphadiazine cream. Burns treated with hydrogel dressings healed more quickly than those treated with usual care.
We searched for studies comparing CPB with standard analgesic therapy in patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer. We were interested in the primary outcome of pain, measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS). We also looked at the amount of opioid (morphine-like drugs) patients took (opioid consumption) and adverse effects of the treatment. Six studies (358 participants) comparing CPB with standard therapy (painkillers) met our inclusion criteria. At four weeks pain scores were significantly lower in the CPB group. Opioid consumption was also significantly lower than in the control group. The main adverse effects were diarrhoea or constipation (this symptom was significantly more likely in the control group, where opioid consumption was higher). Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided CPB is becoming popular as a minimally invasive technique that has fewer risks, but we were not able to find any RCTs assessing this method (current medical literature on this subject is limited to studies without control groups). Although the data on EUS-guided CPB and pain control are promising, we await rigorously designed RCTs that may validate these findings. We conclude that, although statistical evidence is minimal for the superiority of pain relief over analgesic therapy, the fact that CPB causes fewer adverse effects than opioids is important for patients.
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (23 February 2018). This systematic review included 21 trials (involving 142,496 women), but only 20 trials (involving 141,849 women) contributed data. The included trials compared pregnant women who supplemented their diets with multiple micronutrients (including iron and folic acid) with pregnant women who received iron (with or without folic acid) or a placebo. Overall, we found that pregnant women who received multiple-micronutrient supplementation had fewer babies that were born too small (weighing less than 2500 g), fewer babies who were smaller in size than normal for their gestational age, and fewer births that occurred before week 37 of pregnancy. The evidence for the main outcomes of low birthweight and small-for-gestational age was found to be of high quality and moderate quality, respectively. These findings, which have been observed elsewhere, may provide a basis to guide the replacement of iron and folic acid supplements with multiple-micronutrient supplements for pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries.
The researchers identified five studies that included a total of 329 patients. Three studies (270 patients) compared low molecular weight heparin to placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), one study (34 patients) compared low molecular weight heparin in addition to standard therapy, and one study (25 patients) compared unfractionated heparin to steroids. The study comparing unfractionated heparin to steroids and the study that compared the addition of low molecular weight heparin to standard therapy to standard therapy alone was judged to be of low quality. The three placebo-controlled studies were judged to be of high quality. In one small study, unfractionated heparin was worse than steroids for inducing clinical improvement (i.e. reduction of symptoms) in people with severe ulcerative colitis. In addition, rectal bleeding was more frequent among people who received unfractionated heparin. In another small study low molecular weight heparin used with standard therapy provided no additional benefit over standard therapy alone in adults with active ulcerative colitis.
Low molecular weight heparin administered by injection showed no benefit over placebo for any outcome, including clinical remission (very low quality of evidence), clinical improvement and endoscopic improvement (i.e. healing of inflammation). High dose low molecular weight heparin administered via an extended colon-release tablet demonstrated benefit over placebo for clinical remission, clinical improvement. and endoscopic improvement. This result suggests that high dose low molecular weight heparin administered by extended-release capsules may be effective for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. However, this result needs to be verified by future clinical trials.
We identified only three trials involving 102 adults in various settings. All three trials were too small to provide reliable evidence to indicate which types of catheters are best to use in which patients.
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 31 October 2016 and included six RCTs (707 women). Three RCTs included women with current gestational diabetes and did not report data separately for the population of women relevant to this review. Therefore we have only included outcome data from three RCTs, involving 241 pregnant women and their infants. The quality of the evidence was assessed as being low or very low and the overall risk of bias of the RCTs was varied. The three RCTs all compared an oral anti-diabetic agent (metformin) with insulin in pregnant women with pre-existing (type 2) diabetes.
There was no clear difference in the development of pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine) for women who received metformin compared with insulin (2 RCTs; 227 women; very low-quality evidence), though women receiving metformin were less likely to have pregnancy-induced high blood pressure in one RCT (206 women; low-quality evidence). Women who received metformin were less likely to have a caesarean section birth (3 RCTs; 241 women; low-quality evidence), though no difference was observed in induction of labour (2 RCTs; 35 women; very low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference between groups of infants born to mothers who received metformin or insulin for being large-for-gestational age (1 RCT; 206 infants; very low-quality evidence), though infants born to mothers who received metformin were less likely to have low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (3 RCTs; 241 infants; very low-quality evidence). There were no infant deaths (before birth or shortly afterwards) (2 RCTs; very low-quality evidence). The RCTs did not report on many important short- and long-term outcomes, including perineal trauma and a combined outcome of infant death or morbidity, postnatal depression and weight retention for mothers, and adiposity or disability in childhood or adulthood for infants. There is not enough evidence to guide us on the effects of oral anti-diabetic agents in women with established diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance or previous gestational diabetes who are planning a pregnancy, or pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. Further large, well-designed, RCTs are required and could assess and report on the outcomes suggested in this review, including both short- and long-term outcomes for mothers and their infants.
We searched the literature (May 2016) for controlled trials comparing lifestyle intervention with a control group of women receiving usual care or another intervention. Fifteen randomised controlled trials (45 publications) are included in this review, involving 4501 women and 3768 infants. None of the trials were funded by a conditional grant from a pharmaceutical company.
For the baby, lifestyle interventions were associated with a reduction in the risk of being born large-for-gestational age (six trials, 2994 infants). The number of babies with birthweight over 4000 g (macrosomia) was lower with the lifestyle intervention, with no clear difference in the number of newborn babies experiencing low blood glucose levels (six trials, 3000 infants). The evidence was of moderate quality for these findings. Birthweight was also lower in the lifestyle intervention group.
For the mothers, introducing lifestyle interventions made no clear difference in the number of women with pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (four trials, 2796 women) or having a caesarean section (10 trials, 3545 women) based on low-quality evidence or on induction of labour (four trials, 2699 women, high-quality evidence). Similar numbers of women experienced perineal trauma or tearing (one trial, 1000 women) or developed type 2 diabetes at a maximum of 10 years after giving birth (two trials, 486 women). These findings were supported by low- to moderate-quality evidence.
More women in the lifestyle group had met their weight goals one year after giving birth, and lifestyle interventions were associated with a decrease in the risk of depression after birth, from single trials. These findings were supported by low quality evidence. Lifestyle interventions provide benefits to women with GDM and their babies. The interventions are useful as the primary therapeutic strategy and generally include, as a minimum, healthy eating, physical activity and self-monitoring of blood sugar levels.
Furture research could focus on the effective components of lifestyle interventions and the use of lifestyle interventions as the sole intervention without pharmacological treatment. Future studies also need to consider long-term outcomes for the mother and her child as a priority when planning future trials.
We wanted to find out if PARPi treatment, given either with chemotherapy or afterwards as a maintenance treatment:
-  delays death;
-  delays disease progression;
- improves quality of life;
- has any unwanted side effects. We searched for randomised control trials (clinical studies where the treatment or care people receive is chosen at random) from 1990 to Oct 2020.  We searched for studies using PARPi in women with newly-diagnosed EOC and those whose cancer had returned, either more than six months after stopping platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum-sensitive relapse) or within six months of platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum-resistant relapse). We collected data, summarised results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as whether women and their doctors knew what treatment they were having, how studies were conducted, and how many women were included in studies. We found 15 randomised trials of PARP inhibitors (6109 participants) (four studies including 3070 women with newly-diagnosed EOC (first-line treatment) and 11 studies including 3039 women with recurrent cancer). We found 17 ongoing studies.
First-line treatment duringchemotherapy:
— made little to no difference in how long ovarian cancer took to return (progress/recur);
— probably slightly increased serious side effects experience by women during chemotherapy.
However, continuing PARPi after chemotherapy, compared to placebo as a maintenance treatment, often over many months, probably delayed the cancer recurring/progressing. afterchemotherapy:
— probably delayed recurrence of ovarian cancer (no disease progression at 12 months: 55% with PARPi versus 24% for placebo);
— probably little to no difference in how long women survived overall, despite delay in recurrence, although more information may change this outcome over time;
— may be at the expense of an increase in the risk of severe side effects with PARPi, although evidence for this is very uncertain.
Treatment of platinum-sensitive recurrent  EOC
Compared to conventional chemotherapy treatment, PARPi:
— may have little to no difference in terms of overall survival, delay in progression of disease, quality of life and risk of serious side effects.
All of these studies only included patients with BRCA mutations, so it is not clear whether these results would be similar in non-BRCA patients.
PARPi as maintenance treatment, after chemotherapy for platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer:
— had a large effect on delaying recurrence of disease (no disease progression at 12 months 37% with PARPi versus 5.5% for placebo);
— had little to no difference in the overall survival time after treatment;
— may be at the expense of a large increase in the risk of severe side effects.
Treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent EOC
PARPi compared with chemotherapy:
— we are very uncertain about the outcomes, as the quality of the evidence was very low. Although half of the studies were at low risk of bias, some studies used methods that risk introducing bias and some studies were small.  Reporting of quality of life data overall was poor or different methods were used, limiting our ability to combine data on these outcomes. The evidence in this review is current to October 2020.
We wanted to find out whether obesity has any effects on mortality, requiring a breathing tube, hospitalisation, ICU admission, severe disease or pneumonia due to COVID-19 disease. We conducted a systematic search in medical databases for evidence looking at the association of obesity and mortality and other outcomes from December 2019 to April 2021. We then categorised and rated these findings based on our confidence in the evidence, study size, and quality. We identified 171 eligible studies, with 149 studies (12,045,976 participants) providing quantitative data for at least one of our meta-analyses. In terms of the outcomes, 111 studies reported on mortality, 48 on requiring a breathing tube, 47 on ICU admission, 34 on hospitalisation, 32 on severe COVID-19, six on pneumonia, five on length of hospitalisation, two on length of ICU admission, and one on the duration of the requirement of a breathing tube. Our findings indicate that there is a high certainty of evidence that class III obesity is associated with an increased risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients. However, we found that, in mild cases of obesity (classes I and II), this factor might not be independently associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Similarly, we are very certain that obesity is an independent important factor associated with the risk of requiring a breathing tube in COVID-19 patients. However, the effect estimate sizes were not consistent with a dose-response relationship across increasing obesity classes for ICU admission, hospitalisation, severe COVID-19 disease and pneumonia. To conclude, this review investigated the potential association between obesity and adverse COVID-19 outcomes. We were able to gather evidence from multiple studies and concluded that the association of obesity with mortality and requiring a breathing tube is of high certainty. Although BMI is a widely used measurement, the relationship between BMI and body fat is non-linear. Moreover, our review did not discriminate against self-reported and measured BMI. Finally, we were unable to keep up with the rapid pace of publications on COVID-19 despite our best efforts. The evidence is up-to-date to April 2021.
This review evaluated the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of psychostimulants (PS) in the treatment of depression. Twenty-four RCTs were identified, of which 14 had data for meta-analysis. Five drugs were evaluated, including dexamphetamine, methylphenidate, methylamphetamine, pemoline and modafinil. Modafinil was evaluated separately as its pharmacology differs from other PS. Three small trials of PS involving a total of 62 participants indicated that oral treatment with PS in the short term (up to four weeks) significantly reduced depressive symptoms when compared with placebo, however, the overall quality of the trials was poor, limiting confidence in the findings. Two trials involving 411 participants compared modafinil against placebo when combined with antidepressant treatment at 6-8 weeks, and showed a non-significant difference in reducing depression symptoms. One small trial of 50 participants compared oral modafinil against placebo after 12 weeks of treatment, and also showed a non-significant difference in reducing depression symptoms. No trials examined the longer-term effect of PS. Further well conducted trials with long term follow-up are required to find out which PS may be more effective in the treatment of depression, and whether PS are more effective in certain subgroups of depressed patients.
We wanted to find out which medicines were most successful in achieving complete abortion in the first three months of pregnancy, and if the dose or way they were given made a difference. We also wanted to know if there were any unwanted effects  Study characteristics
We included 99 studies that investigated 24 different medicine combinations, doses, and ways of giving the medicine. Misoprostol put into the vagina is probably more effective to achieve abortion than taken orally, and may be associated with less stomach discomfort than if put under the tongue or between the tongue and cheek. Misoprostol alone and mifepristone alone may result in more failed abortions than misoprostol and mifepristone taken together. There may be little or no difference in the success rate of abortions based on whether the medicines are given at home or in hospital, the dosage of mifepristone, or single versus repeated doses of prostaglandin. However, abortions may be more successful if the medicines are given by a doctor in hospital rather than a nurse in hospital. Overall, our confidence in the evidence is limited or very limited for several reasons. Most studies included enough participants and used adequate methods to select them and allocate them to a particular treatment. However, it was difficult to ensure that they and the doctors treating them didn't know what treatment they had received. Several studies did not publish their aims before they started, so it is hard to evaluate whether they measured and reported all their points of interest. Almost all the studies took place in high-income countries, where women can return for a check-up. We don't know if results would have been different in low-income countries. This is a update of a review last published in 2011. The evidence is up to date to February 2021.
A review of the medical literature identified eight clinical trials on gowning in these settings, involving 3811 newborns. Infection rates, death rates, or the length of stay of infants were not significantly affected by wearing gowns. Only two of the trials were considered to be of good quality, and there was variation between trials regarding gowning policies. Gowning did not increase the rate of handwashing. There is no evidence to support the use of gowning by staff to prevent the spread of infection. Based on these studies, gowning may not be a cost effective policy.
We included 10 studies of iron. These 10 studies included 428 people with restless legs syndrome. Not all participants had low blood levels of iron. All participants were adults. Most of the studies used injections of iron, while three studies used iron in pill form. Iron treatment was compared to a non-active treatment (i.e. a placebo) in nine studies. In one study, iron was compared to another restless legs syndrome treatment called a dopamine agonist. The main measure of interest in our review was the severity of restlessness. This was usually measured using a 10-question survey regarding severity and effects of urges to move the legs, called the International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Rating Scale (IRLS). This was measured 2-4 weeks after injections of iron and 12-14 weeks after iron in pill form.
Four trials were funded by the drug manufacturer. Two trials were funded by the USA National Institutes of Health. Two trials were funded by the workplaces of the study investigators. Two studies did not report who funded the study. The four studies funded by drug manufacturers were the largest. The studies funded by drug companies contributed over half of the total number of participants. Overall, the studies showed that iron is better than a placebo for reducing the severity of restless legs syndrome symptoms, although the benefit was low to moderate. This is mostly based on studies using injections of iron, rather than iron pills. Iron was helpful even if blood iron levels were normal at the start of the study. The quality of the evidence was moderate, because not all completed studies have been published, not all important outcomes have been measured, and not enough people have been studied. Side effects were not more common with iron than with placebo. Based on one study, side effects were less common with iron than with another commonly used restless legs syndrome treatment, although the certainty in this result is very low. More studies are needed to allow people with RLS and doctors to make decisions about who should take iron for restless legs syndrome treatment, using what type of iron, and for how long. The evidence is current to September 2017.
We found one controlled clinical trial (poor quality) that compared multidisciplinary rehabilitation to standard outpatient care. The 106 people in this trial received treatment in the hospital outpatient clinic. Participants were in the multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for up to eight weeks, and the results were measured at three and six months after completion of the programme.
There was some evidence to support the benefit of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in reducing disability in people with primary brain tumour. People in the multidisciplinary rehabilitation group showed improvement in their functional abilities (e.g. continence, mobility) and cognitive function compared to the group with standard care only. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was not harmful. Current research gaps highlight the need for high-quality research to explore the effectiveness of various aspects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation and caregiver needs in this patient population.
The evidence in this review is up to date to January 2015.
From our searches we found 21 trials with 905 participants. All trials had problems of design or conduct that might have affected the results. Treatments were studied at birth (14 trials, 560 participants), during relapse (four trials, 181 participants), or at an unknown time (three trials, 153 participants). We required studies to have used 'validated' measures (i.e. shown to be reliable, consistent, and sensitive to change). Many trials did not take bilateral cases (children with two affected feet) into account during randomisation and statistical analysis. For these reasons, we were unable to include much of the data from the trials in the review. Our main measure of the success of treatment was function (how well the foot worked in everyday life). Two trials reported on function but data were not available to re-analyse.
Three trials that compared Ponseti with other casting techniques in children treated at birth provided data that we could analyse on foot alignment. One found that foot position may be better after Ponseti plaster casting than after Kite plaster casting. In the second trial, the evidence was uncertain whether foot position was better after Ponseti plaster casting than after a traditional technique (another type of plaster casting). One trial found that weekly Ponseti casting may be as good as Ponseti plaster casting three times a week (accelerated Ponseti). This trial did not state at which stage the treatment was done. A third trial found that the Ponseti technique may have similar results when using plaster of Paris or semi-rigid fibreglass.
No trial assessed the quality of walking using a validated assessment. Two trials reported on the primary outcome of function using validated scales, but raw data were not available for analysis and the trials did not provide quality-of-life data that were suitable for reporting in the review.
We found no trials in relapsed or neglected clubfoot.
A trial in which the type of presentation was not reported found that there may be no important difference between an accelerated Ponseti or standard Ponseti treatment in foot alignment.
Relapse following the Kite technique more often required major surgery than relapse following the Ponseti technique. Data were not available to assess the results for adding botulinum toxin A, which temporarily weakens injected muscles, to the Ponseti treatment, using different types of plaster casts in the Ponseti treatment, different foot surgeries, or the treatment of relapsed or neglected clubfoot. Most trials did not report on harmful effects. When reported, harmful effects during plaster casting included casts slipping, plaster sores, and skin irritation. Harmful effects of infection and skin grafting were reported after surgery.
The searches for the review are up to date to May 2019.
We included 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (total of 2761 participants). Eleven trials compared the use of fluconazole to placebo or no antifungal treatment. Three trials compared ketoconazole versus placebo. One trial compared anidulafungin with placebo. One trial compared caspofungin to placebo. Two trials compared micafungin to placebo. One trial compared amphotericin B to placebo. Two trials compared nystatin to placebo and one trial compared the effect of clotrimazole, ketoconazole, nystatin and no treatment. The RCTs included participants of both genders with a wide age range and severity of critical illness. The evidence is current as of February 2015. Funding sources from drug manufacturers were reported in 11 out of 22 studies. Another study was funded by a government agency. Results of 19 from 22 randomized trials involved 2374 participants and showed that antifungal medications given before definitive diagnosis of fungal infection did not reduce mortality from all causes. None of the studied drugs were associated with a significant reduction of mortality from all causes. However, results from 17 randomized studies involving 2024 participants showed that antifungal drugs significantly reduced the risk of developing invasive fungal infections.
We also reviewed the evidence from five trials (662 participants) about the effect of antifungal treatment on the development of superficial fungal infections but we did not find any significant difference. However, we found evidence from 12 trials (1020 participants) of a significant reduction of fungi in body sites (excluding blood) not causing an infection. Eleven trials (1691 participants) reported serious adverse events requiring cessation of therapy. We found no evidence of differences in serious adverse events requiring interruption of antifungal medications between people who received and those who did not receive them. The quality of evidence for the outcome of mortality (all-cause) was moderate due to limitations in study design. The quality of evidence for the outcome of invasive fungal infection, superficial fungal infection, fungal colonization and adverse events requiring cessation of therapy was low due to limitations in study design, non-optimal total number of patients studied and results inconsistent across studies. There is moderate quality evidence that the use of antifungal treatment given before definitive diagnosis of fungal infection is not associated with a significant reduction in mortality from all causes among critically ill adults and children with a normal number of neutrophils in the blood. This type of antifungal treatment may be associated with a reduction of invasive fungal infections but the quality of evidence on this point is low.
Further studies with high-quality design are needed to improve the evidence.
We wanted to find out what impact healthy eating interventions have on child diet and health. We were interested in changes to diet, weight, language and cognitive performance, social, emotional and quality of life outcomes in children aged six months to six years attending preschool, long day care, nurseries, kindergartens and family day care services. We also wanted to know the cost of interventions and whether they had any potential unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared healthy eating programmes against no action, delayed delivery of the programme, or a programme that did not aim to change child diet.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 52 studies that looked at the effects of 58 healthy eating programmes in ECEC settings for children aged six months to six years. All studies were published in high and high-middle-income countries. The programmes were very different from each other. They:
• lasted from 4 weeks to 3 years;
• were delivered by a range of people including healthcare providers, ECEC staff, and researchers;
• used different delivery methods (telephone, face-to-face, online, printed materials); and
• measured results in a variety of ways (e.g. parent or staff surveys, observations of children's eating, and weighing foods before and after meals).
Overall, the programmes aimed to:
• change the ECEC environment (e.g. staff demonstrated healthy eating to children, and provided healthier foods);
• change the curriculum (e.g. they provided lessons about foods and healthy eating); and
• establish partnerships (e.g. they provided educational resources to families); and
• increase children's physical activity (e.g. by structured physical activity lessons and encouraging less screen time).
Healthy eating programmes may lead to small improvements in child diet quality, increase fruit consumption by 0.11 servings, potentially improve vegetable consumption by 0.12 servings and may have no effect on consumption of less healthy foods and sugar-sweetened drinks. Further, we found child weight is potentially reduced by 230 g and for every 100 children, 19 would have better weight status. However, we found no evidence of impact on body mass index. The programmes may be cost-effective and likely to have no unwanted effects, although few studies reported these points. Few studies reported on other learning, social and developmental outcomes. Our confidence in the evidence is low because the healthy eating programmes were conducted, delivered and assessed in different ways. Also, many of the people who received the healthy eating programmes were aware that they were being assessed and this can sometimes influence how they report their effects. For example, parents who reported their child's diet may have been more inclined to give positive answers because they felt they were doing what society expected or because they were grateful for the support and wanted to please the researchers. Also, not all studies provided information about everything we were interested in and there was often missing data when children were followed up after the study. The evidence is up-to-date to February 2022.
We planned to rate the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low , low , moderate , or high . Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results.
We were unable to rate the quality of evidence as there was no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the suggestion that opioids in any dose will reduce cancer-related pain in children or adolescents.
We included three small randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) involving a total of 122 children aged up to 12 months who were diagnosed with bronchiolitis. We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this update. The three studies were conducted at single centres in France, the UK, and India. All studies compared CPAP with standard therapy. One study was funded by a university hospital; one reported that no funding was received; and the third study did not mention the funding source. The limited available evidence prevented any conclusions regarding the effect of CPAP on the need for mechanical ventilation in children with bronchiolitis. Limited, low certainty evidence indicated that breathing improved (respiratory rate decreased) in children who received CPAP. The length of time children spent in the hospital was similar between the CPAP and the standard therapy groups. No children in the studies were reported to have died. The studies did not report on time to recovery, change in partial oxygen pressure, how often children were admitted to hospital from the emergency department, how long children were in the emergency department, or the need for intensive care admission. There were no local nasal effects or shock as reported by one study. No children were reported to have had air in the cavity between the lungs and the chest wall, causing lung collapse (pneumothorax) as reported by one study. Two studies did not report on local nasal effects, shock, or pneumothorax. The study added in the previous update of the review in 2019 contributed data to the assessment of respiratory rate and the need for mechanical ventilation. We found limited, low certainty evidence related to CPAP for children with bronchiolitis. The certainty of the evidence was reduced due to high risk of bias, losses to follow-up, selective reporting, and the wide range of values reported by the included studies.
We found 62 randomised controlled trials with 6508 participants, mostly women, from 24 countries. The average age was between 52 and 83 years, with symptoms present from 9 months to 12 years. Sixty studies enrolled people with knee osteoarthritis, one enrolled people with hip osteoarthritis and one enrolled people with knee or hip osteoarthritis. Twenty-two trials compared additional therapies plus exercise therapy to sham additional therapies plus exercise therapy, and 41 compared to exercise therapy. Thirty-eight trials studied electrophysical agents, seven studied manual therapies, four studied acupuncture/dry needling or use of tape, three studied psychological or dietary interventions, whole body vibration (this involves standing on a vibration platform), or spa/mud therapy, and one studied foot orthotics (shoe insoles). Thirty-eight studies were funded, four received no funding and funding support was not reported in 20. Eleven trials (18%) measured adverse (unwanted harmful) events, which included both non-serious and serious adverse events. The most common were increased pain, stiffness or swelling. There was no difference in adverse events between additional therapies used with exercise and sham therapies with exercise. Compared with sham additional therapies used with land-based exercise therapy, additional therapies such as electrophysical agents, acupuncture, dry needling or taping, used with exercise therapy, may not be more effective in improving pain, physical function or quality of life up to six months after treatment.
Pain (lower scores mean less pain)
Improved by 10% or 0.77 points on a zero to 10-point scale.
Physical function scores (lower scores mean better physical function)
Improved by 12% or 5.03 points on a zero to 68-point scale.
Quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life)
Worse by 1% or 0.75 points worse on a zero to 100-point scale.
Adverse events
Although not commonly reported in studies, there was no difference in adverse events between additional therapies used with exercise and sham therapies with exercise. Compared with land-based exercise therapy, additional therapies (manual therapies, electrotherapy, dietary interventions, psychological therapies, whole body vibration, acupuncture, dry needling, taping, spa/mud therapy or foot orthotics) plus exercise therapy, may not be more effective in improving pain, physical function, quality of life or joint changes measured with X-rays up to six months after treatment.

Adverse effects
Although not commonly reported in studies, risks appear no greater for additional therapies used with exercise compared to exercise only.
Fewer studies assessed outcomes six or 12 months after treatment. Additional therapies plus land-based exercise therapy may be no better in reducing pain or improving physical function or quality of life than exercise therapy at 6 or 12 months. In patient-reported overall assessment, 31% reported improvement at 6 months, and 42% reported improvement at 12 months. Additional therapies plus exercise therapy do not appear to offer meaningful improvements in pain, function, quality of life or overall change for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis compared with sham additional therapies plus land-based exercise therapy; or in pain, function, quality of life or changes on X-rays when compared with exercise therapy only. Compared with exercise therapy there is probably a clinical benefit in patient-reported overall change for additional therapies plus exercise therapy, based on a small number of studies. Our confidence in the evidence varies between moderate to little or no confidence for different outcomes. Although results indicate no increased adverse events from additional therapies used with exercise therapy, this was poorly reported. Most studies evaluated short-term effects, with limited medium- or long-term evaluation.
The review authors searched the medical literature up to 7 January 2014, and identified seven relevant medical trials, with a total of 403 participants. Six trials compared the use of phototherapy with standard care only; one trial compared it with standard care plus sham phototherapy. Only one trial included a third treatment group that investigated another type of phototherapy.
Two trials reported the time taken for pressure ulcers to heal completely, and these showed an improvement in healing time for people in the phototherapy group who received treatment with ultraviolet light. However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as these were small, poor quality trials, at unclear risk of bias (i.e. with potentially misleading results), and the findings may have been due to chance. The other trials reported either conflicting results or various measures/time points among trials, which meant that we could not conclude whether or not phototherapy is effective for treating pressure ulcers. Two trials reported incidence of harmful (adverse) effects and noted no significant differences between the phototherapy and standard treatment groups. Four trials provided funding information, two from industry funding, the others from an institutional grant. No studies reported on quality of life, length of hospital stay, pain or cost.
This review identified only a few, small studies provided with insufficient evidence to support the use of phototherapy as a routine treatment for pressure ulcers. More trials will need to be conducted before it can be established whether this treatment works and is safe.
We searched scientific databases for studies that compared strategies that research teams use to improve trial retention against each other or against not using such a strategy.We looked for studies that included participants from any age, gender, ethnic, language or geographic group. We then compared the results of the studies, and summarised the evidence that we had found. Finally, we rated our confidence in this evidence, based on factors such as the methods used in the studies and their size, and the consistency of findings across studies. We identified 70 relevant articles, which reported 81 retention studies involving more than 100,000 participants, that had investigated different ways of trying to encourage randomised trial participants to provide data and stay in the trial. We organised these into broad comparison groups but, unfortunately, we are not able to say with confidence that any of the results we found is a true effect and not caused by other factors, such as flaws with the design of the studies. As such, the effect of ways to encourage people to stay involved in trials is still not clear and more research is needed to see if these retention methods really do work. The strategies we identified were tested in randomised trials run in many different disease areas and settings but, in some cases, were tested in only one trial. None of the comparisons we made provided high quality evidence and more studies are needed to help provide more confidence for the results we did find. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to January 2020.
We found 10 studies in 3319 people (aged 2 years and older). The studies lasted from 3 months to 24 months, and took place in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Kuwait, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and South Africa.
The studies looked at the effects of:
· wheat flour containing added iron (with or without other minerals and vitamins) compared with wheat flour without added iron (but with the same other minerals and vitamins);
· wheat flour containing added iron and other minerals and vitamins compared with wheat flour without any added minerals or vitamins.
The wheat flours used in the studies contained different amounts of iron: from under 40 mg/kg to over 60 mg/kg.
We were interested in:
· how many people had anaemia (defined by low haemoglobin levels);
· how many people had low levels of iron in their blood (iron deficiency; tested using a biomarker);
· haemoglobin concentrations in people's blood;
· how many children had diarrhoea or respiratory infections;
· how many children died (of any cause);
· signs of infection or inflammation (the body's response to injury) in children (by testing a biomarker in the blood); and
· any unwanted effects.
Most studies had multiple sources of funding; some were partly funded by companies involved in the food, chemical or pharmaceutical industries.  Flour containing added iron (with or without other minerals and vitamins):
· may reduce anaemia, by 27% (evidence from 5 studies, 2315 people); and
· probably makes no difference to children's risk of infection or inflammation (2 studies, 558 children).
It was unclear how flour with added iron affected iron deficiency (3 studies, 748 people), or haemoglobin levels (8 studies, 2831 people). Flour containing added iron (with other minerals and vitamins) probably reduced iron deficiency (3 studies, 382 people). It was unclear from the studies how flour containing added iron affected anaemia (2 studies, 317 people) or haemoglobin levels (4 studies, 532 people).
No studies reported information about unwanted effects, or how many children died, or had diarrhoea or respiratory infections. Our confidence is moderate to low that adding iron to flour probably reduces iron deficiency and anaemia. The studies appeared to show fewer people with iron deficiency and slightly higher haemoglobin levels associated with flour with added iron, but the results varied widely, so we are uncertain about the effect. These results might change if further evidence becomes available. We found limitations in the ways some of the studies were designed and conducted, and this could have affected their results. Adding iron to wheat flour may lead to fewer people with anaemia or low blood-iron levels in the general population.
We do not know if adding iron to wheat flour causes any unwanted effects, because no studies looked at these.
Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia, a mental health problem that can cause symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and social withdrawal. Clozapine may be useful in those for whom other medications have not worked very well. One of the common side-effects of clozapine is having too much saliva in the mouth (hypersalivation). This can be embarrassing in public and problematic, especially at night. This review is about ways of reducing this problem and includes 15 trials containing 964 people, most of which were done in hospitals in China. Treatments included medications that had previously been useful for this problem or were thought to work in theory. The medications used were from a group of drugs called antimuscarinics, traditional Chinese medicines or others. The trials were short (all four weeks or less). From these trials the antimuscarinics; astemizole, diphenhydramine and propantheline, were shown to be better than placebo at reducing hypersalivation. Another medication called oryzanol and a Chinese traditional medicine called Suo quo wan were found to have benefit over doxepin, an antimuscarinic. However, because of the shortness of the trials, poor reporting and the limitations of design, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from these results.  

(Plain language summary prepared for this review by Janey Antoniou of RETHINK, UK, www.rethink.org)
Twenty-three studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria with a total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively. The methodological quality of all the studies was rated intermediate to low. Trials duration was no longer than one year. The level of glycosylated haemoglobin, a marker of diabetes control, was lower in the long acting insulin group, but the observed difference was of doubtful clinical significance. Longer acting insulins were superior mostly in their nocturnal effect, which resulted in a lower level of fasting glucose levels and fewer episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. No data on long term complications were available. 
The currently available data can not substantiate conclusions on the benefits and risks of long acting insulins, and long-term data are of need.
Surgery to bypass the blockage uses either a piece of vein from another part of the person’s body or a synthetic graft. The bypass may help improve blood supply to the leg but the graft can also become blocked, even in the first year. To help prevent this, people are given aspirin (an antiplatelet drug) or a vitamin K antagonist (anti-blood clotting or antithrombotic drug), or both, to try to stop loss of blood flow through the graft (patency). The review of trials found that patients undergoing venous grafts were more likely to benefit from treatment with vitamin K antagonists than platelet inhibitors. Patients receiving an artificial graft may benefit from platelet inhibitors (aspirin). However, the evidence is not conclusive. Although a total of 14 randomised, controlled trials involving 4970 patients were included in the review, trials with larger patient numbers are needed. This is because there was considerable variation between the included trials in whether patients received both types of drugs, anticoagulation levels and how they were measured, and the indications for surgery, intermittent claudication or critical limb ischaemia.
This review found a lack of high-quality evidence to back up any advice on which interventions to use. We examined 41 randomised controlled trials that included 5449 women in early pregnancy. These studies examined the effectiveness of many treatments including acupressure to the P6 point on the wrist, acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger, chamomile, vitamin B6, lemon oil, mint oil, and several drugs that are used to reduce nausea or vomiting. Some studies showed a benefit in improving nausea and vomiting symptoms for women, but generally effects were inconsistent and limited. Overall, studies had low risk of bias related to blinding and reporting on all participants in the studies. However some aspects of the studies were reported incompletely in a way that meant how participants were allocated to groups was unclear and not all results were fully and clearly reported. Most studies had different ways of measuring the symptoms of nausea and vomiting and therefore, we could not look at these findings together. Few studies reported maternal and fetal adverse outcomes and there was very little information on the effectiveness of treatments for improving women's quality of life.
In January 2012, we did a computer search for studies of birth control pills and acne treatment. Outcomes could be the amount of acne, how severe the acne was, and how many women dropped out early due to problems. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We included randomized trials in any language that compared two types of birth control pills, a pill and a placebo or 'dummy,' or a pill and another acne treatment.
The review now includes 31 trials with a total of 12,579 women. Ten studies used dummies. Overall, 24 pairs of treatments or placebos were compared: 6 compared a birth control pill and a placebo, 17 compared different types of birth control pills, and 1 compared a pill and an antibiotic. The six pills studied in trials with placebos worked well to reduce facial acne. When we compared pills with different hormones, we did not see any important and consistent differences.
The conclusions did not change when we added trials in this update. Most trials compared two types of pills for acne treatment. Better quality studies are needed to compare one birth control pill with another. Studies should use standard methods for reporting how severe the acne is. How birth control pills compare to other acne treatments like antibiotics is not clear. Since birth control pills improve acne, they can be used to treat women with acne who also want birth control.
A systematic review summarises evidence from multiple studies to answer a specific research question (e.g. what are the benefits and harms of a particular intervention for a particular health condition?). Often, there are many outcomes that systematic review authors could report to address their research question (e.g. pain, disability and quality of life for patients with musculoskeletal conditions) and many different results available for a particular outcome (e.g. a study might measure pain using three different scales at four time points). If the decision about which outcomes to investigate in a systematic review is made based on the results for those outcomes in the eligible studies, this may lead to bias. While, if the decision about which outcomes to report in a systematic review and the ways to report them is based on the results, this may mislead users of the systematic review.
This methodology review summarises the findings of studies examining the inclusion of results and reporting of outcomes in systematic reviews. We searched for studies indexed in electronic bibliographic databases up to May 2013. We included seven studies and found that outcomes investigated and reported in systematic reviews were often changed between the protocol and published systematic review. We also found that it was unclear whether the decision to make these changes was related to how statistically convincing the treatment effect for that outcome was. More studies are needed to confirm if this relationship exists. Also, one study found that some systematic reviews did not report all of the most important outcomes in the abstract of the review. Another study found that outcomes with a more statistically convincing result were more likely to be completely reported in the abstract than other outcomes. The studies that we included were limited to systematic reviews published before 2009. New studies are needed to examine the inclusion of results and reporting of outcomes in more recent systematic reviews.
Two studies reported costs of self-monitoring: One study compared the costs of self-monitoring of blood glucose with self-monitoring of urine glucose based on nine measurements per week and with the prices in US dollars for self-monitoring in 1990. They concluded that total costs in the first year of self-monitoring of blood glucose, with the purchase of a reflectance meter were 12 times more expensive than self-monitoring of urine glucose ($481 or 361 EURO [11/2011 conversion] versus $40 or 30 EURO [11/2011 conversion]). Another study reported a full economical evaluation of the costs and effects of self-monitoring. At the end of the trial, costs for the intervention were £89 (104 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for standardized usual care (control group), £181 (212 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the less intensive self-monitoring group and £173 (203 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the more intensive self-monitoring group.
We did not find good evidence for an effect on general health-related quality of life, general well-being, patient satisfaction, or on the decrease of the number of hypoglycaemic episodes. However, hypoglycaemic episodes were more often reported in the self-monitoring blood glucose groups than in the control groups (four studies). Because patients in the self-monitoring blood glucose groups can use their device to confirm both periods of asymptomatic and symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes, this is according to expectations.
We found five studies, four of them were conducted in Europe and one in North America. The trials presented results from 233 participants (466 eyes) at follow-up of 3 to 6 months. • People with trifocal lenses may have distance vision that is not very different to the distance vision of people who have TECNIS Symfony EDOF lenses after cataract extraction (low-certainty evidence). However, people with trifocal lenses may have better near vision and may be less likely to need spectacles compared with people with EDOF lenses (low-certainty evidence).
• Study participants completed questionnaires about their vision after cataract surgery. These showed that both types of lenses worked well and there did not seem to be any important differences between them (low-certainty evidence).
• Halos and glare occur with both types of lenses, with no meaningful difference detected between the lenses (low-certainty evidence).
• Adverse effects were uncommon (low-certainty evidence). All studies were relatively short-term in nature, with none reporting economic outcomes. We judged the evidence as 'low certainty' because the studies had imprecise results, and we were unsure if the design of the studies might have led to bias in the results. We searched for studies that had been published up to 15 June 2022.
We wanted to find out if using lower sodium levels in the dialysis fluid was better than a higher level for reducing the amount of fluid retained between dialysis sessions, preventing heart damage and improving a patient's overall wellbeing. We combined all studies of people treated with haemodialysis where outcomes were compared between people receiving low sodium in their dialysis fluid and those receiving higher levels. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 17 studies randomising 509 adults comparing low sodium levels in dialysis fluid with neutral or high sodium levels. Seven studies were performed before the year 2000, studying dialysis techniques that are not always relevant today. Most studies were randomised cross-over studies (where a patient is randomly assigned to start on one treatment for a period of time and then changes to the other treatment, usually with a short delay between treatments) and most studies only lasted for a few weeks. Our main findings were that low sodium in dialysis fluid reduces weight gain between dialysis treatments and the amount of blood pressure lowering medicines required, and probably improves heart structure, lowers blood pressure and reduces the amount of sodium in the blood between dialysis treatments, which are good things. However, the intervention probably increases the number of cramps and low blood pressure events experienced by patients during dialysis, which are bad things. The studies did not provide enough information about the participating patients for us to know which patients might benefit from low sodium dialysis fluid, and which patients might instead be harmed. The studies did not provide definitive information on the effect of low sodium dialysis fluids on patients' quality of life and survival. We are confident low sodium in the dialysis fluid reduces weight gain between dialysis treatments and reduces the amount of blood pressure lowering medicines required. We are moderately confident low sodium in the dialysis fluid probably improves heart structure and lowers blood pressure and the amount of sodium in the blood between dialysis treatment.
We are also moderately confident that low sodium in the dialysis fluid probably increases cramps and the number of low blood pressure events experienced by patients during dialysis. We have no confidence in the effect of low sodium on a patient's quality of life or survival. The evidence is current to 1 October 2024.
We searched for new evidence in October 2016 and identified no new randomised controlled trials.
From previous updates, this review found limited evidence on the effectiveness of NSAIDs (specifically naproxen) for management of pain caused by endometriosis. This review is also limited in that it includes only one study with data suitable for analysis, and this study involved only 20 women. Available evidence is of very low quality, mainly owing to poor reporting of methods, lack of precision in findings for overall pain relief, unintended side effects of treatment and the need for extra pain relief. The included trial did not report on quality of life, effects on daily activities, absence from work or school or participant satisfaction with treatment. Available evidence does not allow us to conclude whether NSAIDs are effective for managing pain caused by endometriosis, or whether any individual NSAID is more effective than another. As has been shown in other Cochrane reviews, women who use NSAIDs must be aware that NSAIDs may cause adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and drowsiness. Unless we identify new evidence in the future, we will not update this review again. Evidence was of very low quality owing to risk of bias and imprecision (findings were based on a single small trial).
There is currently only one study reporting on 47 babies that fulfils our review criteria and compares different high dose versus low dose of initial replacement thyroxine for the treatment of congenital hypothyroidism. There is not enough evidence to suggest that a high dose is more beneficial than a low dose therapy. Growth and adverse effects were not reported in the included study. There should be more randomised controlled trials to assess the effects of high versus low dose of initial thyroid hormone replacement for congenital hypothyroidism.
This review investigated whether having mental health workers on-site to work with physicians at their offices would change the care that physicians provide. Forty-two studies were reviewed in which on-site mental health workers, such as counsellors or psychiatrists, worked alongside physicians to provide therapy to patients. The review found that when there were mental health workers on-site, patients may reduce the number of visits to their doctors; doctors may reduce how often they refer patients to off-site mental health specialists; doctors may reduce the number of drugs they prescribe to the patients who see the mental health workers; and the costs related to those drugs may be lower. However, these reductions were small and not found consistently in all the studies. 

The review also found that there may be little or no difference in how the doctors prescribe drugs or refer patients who have mental health problems but are not seeing the on-site mental health workers. It is also not known what the effect of on-site mental health workers had on how well physicians recognised and diagnosed mental health problems.
We searched for all published qualitative studies that reported on healthcare workers' views and experiences of primary healthcare integration up to 28 July 2020. We described the different study methods, countries, the scope and type of primary healthcare integration approaches, and the different types of healthcare workers and client groups involved. We then grouped the studies into categories. We included 184 studies. The studies were from 37 countries. About half the studies took place in high-income countries and half in low- and middle-income countries.
The studies we found in our review covered a variety of settings, participants, and types of primary healthcare integration. There were different configurations for which healthcare service programmes were being combined for integrated service delivery. These were categorised into the following six configurations: mental health; HIV, tuberculosis, and sexual reproductive health; maternal, woman, and child health; non-communicable diseases (for example, heart disease, diabetes); general primary health integration, and allied and specialised services. We also explored whether integrated service delivery was fully or partially integrated, and the different integration strategies used to link and co-ordinate services.
The people participating in the implementation of integration interventions included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied healthcare professionals, lay health workers, and health system support staff. A wide range of clients were recipients of the integrated services. This scoping review shows the variety of primary healthcare integration approaches that have been studied. Researchers and decision-makers need to understand the relationship between different integration approaches and contexts, and the ways in which healthcare workers influence the impacts of this integration. The study categories we have developed can help researchers to understand these different types of integration approaches and to identify more focused questions for future systematic reviews.
We reviewed 14 trials. The evidence in general was found was to be of low quality. These studies involved the mothers being given vitamin A or not, within the first six weeks after giving birth, or compared a high dose of vitamin A with a low dose. Our review looked at the overall health of the mothers and their infants, any adverse effects and the levels of retinol, which is a by-product of vitamin A, in the mother's breast milk. There was no change in how many mothers or babies died or were unwell. The mothers and their babies did not experience adverse effects. There was evidence of improved amounts of retinol in breast milk. In summary, although extra vitamin A given to the mother may slightly improve the amount of this nutrient in her breast milk, it probably makes little or no difference to deaths in the mother or baby. It may lead to little or no difference in any adverse effects to the mother or baby.
Previous research on animal and physiological models suggests that antioxidant supplements have beneficial effects that may prolong life. Some observational studies also suggest that antioxidant supplements may prolong life, whereas other observational studies demonstrate neutral or harmful effects. Our Cochrane review from 2008 demonstrated that antioxidant supplements seem to increase mortality. This review is now updated.
The present systematic review included 78 randomised clinical trials. In total, 296,707 participants were randomised to antioxidant supplements (beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention. Twenty-six trials included 215,900 healthy participants. Fifty-two trials included 80,807 participants with various diseases in a stable phase (including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, ocular, dermatological, rheumatoid, renal, endocrinological, or unspecified diseases). A total of 21,484 of 183,749 participants (11.7%) randomised to antioxidant supplements and 11,479 of 112,958 participants (10.2%) randomised to placebo or no intervention died. The trials appeared to have enough statistical similarity that they could be combined. When all of the trials were combined, antioxidants may or may not have increased mortality depending on which statistical combination method was employed; the analysis that is typically used when similarity is present demonstrated that antioxidant use did slightly increase mortality (that is, the patients consuming the antioxidants were 1.03 times as likely to die as were the controls). When analyses were done to identify factors that were associated with this finding, the two factors identified were better methodology to prevent bias from being a factor in the trial (trials with ‘low risk of bias’) and the use of vitamin A. In fact, when the trials with low risks of bias were considered separately, the increased mortality was even more pronounced (1.04 times as likely to die as were the controls). The potential damage from vitamin A disappeared when only the low risks of bias trials were considered. The increased risk of mortality was associated with beta-carotene and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A, but was not associated with the use of vitamin C or selenium. The current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant supplements in the general population or in patients with various diseases.
We identified 25 randomised controlled trials. No two trials investigated the same antibiotics, and there was no standard treatment regime used as a comparison. We are not able to define the best treatment for cellulitis and our limited conclusions are mostly based on single trials. No single treatment was clearly superior. Surprisingly, oral antibiotics appeared to be more effective than antibiotics given into a vein for moderate and severe cellulitis. This merits further study. Antibiotics given by injection into a muscle were as effective as when given into a vein, with a lower incidence of adverse events. In one study the addition of corticosteroids to an antibiotic appeared to shorten the length of hospital stay, however further trials are needed. A single small study indicated vibration therapy may increase the rate of recovery but the results of single trials should be viewed with caution. We had insufficient data to give meaningful results for adverse events.
This review assesses different intermittent drug techniques compared with maintenance treatment in people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Seventeen studies with 2252 participants compared intermittent drug techniques with standard maintenance on medication. Relapse was significantly higher in people receiving intermittent drug treatment. Hospitalisation was higher for people receiving intermittent drug treatment.
Results suggest that intermittent treatment is not as effective as continuous or maintained treatment in preventing relapse. Although information favours maintenance and continuous treatment, this is not always the case in real settings, where people may stop their medication due to debilitating side effects that affect their quality of life. More research is needed to assess any potential benefits or harm of intermittent treatment, particularly regarding the side effects commonly associated with maintained antipsychotic treatment. There was no exploration of economic/money savings, specifically relating to the potential cost-effectiveness of intermittent techniques.
Until further evidence is available concerning the potential benefits or harms of intermittent treatment, managers, psychiatrists and policy makers should consider it an experimental therapy.

In December 2016 and January 2017, we searched for clinical trials on the addition of ketamine to morphine-like drugs for cancer pain.
We found one new study, together with the two studies included in the original review. The three studies were very different, using different doses of ketamine, different routes of administration and different durations of treatment and it was not possible to combine the results of these studies. The two smallest studies reported that the addition of ketamine to morphine reduced pain intensity and morphine requirements. The third study which used high doses of ketamine reported no clinical benefit of adding ketamine to different opioids. Increased doses of ketamine in some participants caused side effects such as hallucinations. The study which examined high doses of ketamine reported two serious adverse events, which may have been related to ketamine. Although two out of three studies reported reduction in pain, this could be due to chance in such small studies. We rated the quality of the evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. The evidence from the studies was of very low quality. There were problems with the design of some studies and there were not enough data to answer some parts of our review question.
We wanted to find out if myo-inositol is an effective antenatal dietary supplement for preventing gestational diabetes in pregnant women. We searched for studies that compared myo-inositol (given alone or in combination with another treatment) with no treatment or another treatment. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found seven studies on 1319 women who were 10 weeks to 24 weeks pregnant. We are unclear whether supplementation with myo-inositol is associated with a reduction in the rate of gestational diabetes. However, myo-inositol may be associated with a reduction of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. We are unclear whether myo-inositol supplementation decreases the number of babies who were born large for gestational age.
The studies did not provide any information about the number of babies that died (either before birth or shortly afterwards), depression, or subsequent type 2 diabetes after delivery. There were no maternal adverse effects of therapy in the five studies that reported on this outcome; the other two studies did not mention this.
We are unclear about the effect of supplementation with myo-inositol on weight gain during pregnancy or on a baby with low blood glucose levels. This review did not find any impact on other outcomes, such as the risk of having a caesarean section or a large baby. This may be due to the studies being too small to detect differences in these outcomes and the outcomes not being reported by all studies. However, myo-inositol may be associated with a reduction in the rate of preterm birth compared with the control group.
The included studies did not report on many other relevant mother and baby outcomes, nor did they have any data relating to longer-term outcomes for the mother or infant, or the cost to the health services.
There is not enough evidence to support that giving myo-inositol as a dietary supplement during pregnancy, prevents gestational diabetes. However, myo-inositol may prevent hypertensive (high blood pressure) disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth. Further large, well-designed, randomised controlled trials are required to assess the effectiveness of myo-inositol in preventing gestational diabetes and improving other health outcomes for mothers and their babies. We have little confidence in the evidence because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results and many of our review outcomes were not reported in the studies that we identified. The studies were also limited to populations from high-income settings and so results may not be applicable to other populations. The studies also had some limitations on how they reported the methods. This evidence is up-to-date to December 2022.
We included two randomised controlled studies with 116 women in the review. These studies compared planned home versus hospital management for women with preterm, prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM). In both studies there were strict criteria for deciding whether women could be included; for example, women had to live within a certain distance of emergency facilities, and there had to be no signs that mothers and babies had infection or other problems. There was a period of monitoring in hospital for women in both groups.
Results suggested that there were few differences in mothers' and babies' health for women cared for at home or in hospital including infant death, serious illness, or admission to intensive care baby units.
There was some evidence that women managed in hospital were more likely to be delivered by caesarean section. Women cared for at home were likely to spend less time in hospital (spending approximately 10 fewer days as inpatients) and were more satisfied with their care. In addition, home care was associated with reduced costs. Overall, the number of women included in the two studies was too small to allow adequate assessment of outcomes.
There have been few trials of treatment for Charcot-Marie Tooth disease. One very small trial of the nerve growth promoting factor, neurotrophin-3, showed possible benefit but needs to be replicated. Trials of exercise, orthosis, creatine and ganglioside injections have been done but did not show significant benefit. These were all too small to identify moderate benefit or harm. Trials of vitamin C for the commonest type of Charcot-Marie Tooth disease are in progress.
The review identified four large randomised controlled trials (3925 women) that compared treatment with breast conserving surgery alone and breast conserving surgery with the addition of RT. The addition of RT reduced the risk of a recurrence of either DCIS or invasive cancer in the treated breast by 51%.
Older trials of breast conserving surgery followed by RT for invasive breast cancer have shown long-term toxicity from the addition of RT. We found no evidence of increased toxicity from the use of RT although some trials did not report on the causes of non-breast cancer deaths (deaths which potentially could be related to side effects). The number of non-breast cancer deaths reported were similar in both radiotherapy and control groups. Changes in delivery of RT between older and more recent trials and a subsequent decrease in exposure of normal tissue may account for this finding. Longer follow up of trial participants is required before a definite conclusion can be drawn, however radiotherapy techniques are continuing to improve and future patients are likely to experience a further decrease in exposure of nearby normal tissues. Overall survival was high and similar between each group whether radiotherapy was used or not. There were no reports of short-term toxicity from use of radiotherapy, or quality of life data.
We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants). At least one study assessed each eligible treatment.
Most trial participants were female, aged between 12 and 30 years, with mild to moderate acne. Nearly 60% of the trials treated participants for longer than eight weeks. Study duration ranged from three months to three years.
Nine trials reported pharmaceutical support. The studies were mainly conducted in Europe, Asia, and the USA, in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and universities. The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long term (more than 8 weeks) for the outcome 'Participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement' (PGA) and mixed in length, but mainly medium term (from 5 to 8 weeks), for 'Total number of participants who experienced at least one minor side effect'.
Azelaic acid probably leads to worse PGA when compared to benzoyl peroxide, but when compared to tretinoin, there is probably little or no difference (both moderate-quality evidence). When comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin, there may be little or no difference in PGA (low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether azelaic acid reduces PGA compared to adapalene (very low-quality evidence).
In terms of participant withdrawal (for any reason), there may be no difference when azelaic acid is compared with benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, and tretinoin (all low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether azelaic acid reduces withdrawals when compared to adapalene (very low-quality evidence).
We are uncertain whether azelaic acid has fewer total minor adverse events when compared to adapalene or benzoyl peroxide (very-low quality evidence). When comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin, there may be no difference in total adverse events (low-quality evidence). The studies that compared azelaic acid with tretinoin only reported individual side effects (e.g. scaling).
We are uncertain if there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid on PGA score (very low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin in PGA (low-quality evidence). No study comparing salicylic acid with benzoyl peroxide assessed PGA. There may be no difference in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid; there were no withdrawals when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin (both low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (very low-quality evidence).
We are uncertain whether salicylic acid reduces total minor adverse events when compared to benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin (very low-quality evidence). For salicylic acid compared with pyruvic acid only individual application site reactions were reported (e.g. scaling and redness).
None of the four studies assessing nicotinamide (compared to clindamycin or erythromycin) assessed PGA. Nicotinamide may make no difference to withdrawals when compared to clindamycin or erythromycin, and may make no difference to total minor adverse events when compared to clindamycin (both low-quality evidence); however, no studies comparing nicotinamide with erythromycin looked at total minor adverse events.
Glycolic acid peels may make no difference to PGA when compared to salicylic-mandelic acid peels (low-quality evidence), we are uncertain of the effect on total minor adverse events (very low-quality evidence), and there were no withdrawals (low-quality evidence). Our evidence quality was mixed for the PGA outcome (very low to moderate), mainly low quality for withdrawals, and very low quality for total minor side effects. We had some concerns with the small size of the studies and how they were conducted.
This review examined all the randomised controlled trials of the use of intravenous beta2-agonists in acute asthma and found no evidence to support its use.
We asked if calcium supplements taken by mothers during pregnancy reduced the number of babies born too early (preterm) or reduced the number of babies with low birthweight (less than 2500 g). We also asked if there might be any unwanted effects on either babies or their mothers. We excluded studies on mothers with high blood pressure as this is covered by other Cochrane reviews. This is an update of a review first published in 2015. We found 19 studies with data for our review, which involved 16,625 mothers and their babies. The studies were undertaken in a large number of countries. The biggest study involved 8325 mothers and babies, and the smallest study involved 23 mothers and babies. The included studies were generally of good quality, were mostly of high-dose calcium and we are reasonably confident in the data we have.
We found that calcium supplements probably leads to slightly fewer babies born before 37 weeks (11 studies, 15,379 mothers and babies). However, we found there was probably no difference in the number of babies born before 34 weeks (3 studies, 5569 mothers and babies). There may be little to no effect on low birthweight (6 studies, 14,162 women and babies). Mothers who took extra calcium reported similar unwanted effects as those mothers who did not take any extra calcium. However, only a few studies reported on unwanted effects. Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because the effect of calcium appeared to differ slightly between studies. The studies were also limited to only high doses of calcium and few studies reported on unwanted effects. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.
This review is current until December 2015. We included four trials involving 205 participants. All four studies assessed effects of HVHF compared with the current standard haemofiltration and included participants with severe sepsis or septic shock who had been admitted to an ICU. Three of the four studies were very small (fewer than 20 participants enrolled in each study). The maximum time that participants were followed up after inclusion in any of the studies was 28 days. Two studies received financial support from pharmaceutical companies, and one study received support from a health research organization.
Key results
Outcome data were limited - two trials reported death rates at 28 days and one reported death rates in hospital; in the fourth study, the number of deaths stated did not match the quoted mortality rates. One study reported length of stay in the ICU, and one provided data on organ dysfunction. Investigators described no complications.
No clear evidence showed any benefit of HVHF in critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.
Quality of evidence
Evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of high-volume haemofiltration in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Studies included in this review reported relatively small numbers of participants and measured different outcomes; therefore, we judged the quality of evidence with respect to the impact of HVHF as low. Larger trials, carried out at many centres, are required for full assessment of clinically relevant outcomes and for evaluation of cost versus benefit.
We wanted to find out the effect of opioids in babies exposed to painful procedures, compared to:
• no treatment or placebo;
• non-drug treatments (such as sweet solutions);
• other drugs;
• different types of opioids;
• or same opioid administered by a different route, for example by mouth compared to by injection. We searched for studies looking at the five comparisons described above. We compared and summarized study results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 13 studies involving a total of 823 babies. The largest study was in 150 babies, and the smallest in 12 babies. All studies were performed in a hospital. Four studies were conducted in India, two each in Italy and the UK, one each in Canada, Finland, Iran, and the USA, and one was an international study conducted in France and the USA.
Seven studies compared opioids to placebo; two studies compared opioids to oral sweet solution or other treatments such as touching the baby's body; and five studies compared opioids to another drug.
Compared to placebo, opioids probably result in a reduction in pain score assessed with certain scales during the procedure, but in little or no difference between groups with other scales one to two hours after the procedure. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on pain assessed with other pain scores or at different time points.  The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on episodes of bradycardia, hypotension or breathing stops requiring resuscitation. Opioids may increase episodes of breathing stops. No studies reported parent satisfaction with medical care.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on any outcome when compared to other treatments, such as touching the baby's body or giving other drugs. We are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes. Moreover, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were giving to the babies. Few studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. We searched for studies up to December 2021.
We found 22 studies with 7711 participants. These studies were published from 1971 to 2017. In these studies, chance decided whether people received an antibiotic or a placebo/no treatment. The evidence is current to 4 February 2019. Antibiotics given for UTI prevention before cystoscopy may have had little or no effect on the risk of developing a more serious infection that went into the bloodstream.
They may have reduced the risk of infection when both serious infection that went into the bloodstream and infections limited to the bladder were taken together.
None of the people included in the trials had serious unwanted effects. Therefore, we concluded that antibiotics given for prevention of UTIs may not cause serious unwanted effects but we are very uncertain of this finding.
Antibiotics may also have had little or no effect on minor unwanted effects. They may also have had little or no effect on infections limited to the bladder taken alone, but we were very uncertain of this finding. People treated with antibiotics may have been more likely to have bacteria that were more resistant to antibiotics, but we are very uncertain of this finding. We rated the quality of the evidence as low or very low meaning that our confidence in the results was limited or very limited. The true effect of antibiotics for prevention of UTIs before cystoscopy may be quite different from what this review found.
This review found that first-line chemotherapy (anticancer drugs) may prolong the survival of patients with advanced small cell lung cancer for some months when compared to supportive care, although the effect of this treatment on quality of life is unknown. The benefit of a new treatment (second-line chemotherapy) when the disease has progressed or relapsed was even smaller, and the potential survival gain of some weeks must be balanced against its possible secondary effects. Since the available studies were scarce and of variable quality, more clinical trials are needed to assess and better inform patients about the real effectiveness of chemotherapy in advanced small cell lung cancer.
Until then, the reviewers propose that the use of antidepressants which have no known life threatening side effects remain more attractive. The review sets out the required methodology for effectively studying these substances in proper controlled studies.
This review examined the effects of olanzapine compared to other second generation antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia. We identified 50 relevant studies with 9476 participants, comparing olanzapine with amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. Comparisons of olanzapine with the second generation antipsychotic drugs sertindole or zotepine are currently not available. Olanzapine was somewhat more efficacious than aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone, whereas there was no efficacy difference compared to amisulpride and clozapine. The main disadvantage of olanzapine was its higher weight gain and associated metabolic problems compared to all other second generation antipsychotic drugs, except for clozapine.
Study participants were adults or children with the common cold. The effects of four combinations (AH + DC; AH + AN; AN + DC; AH + AN + DC) were compared to those of placebo (dummy treatment) (24 trials) or an active substance (6 trials). A beneficial effect was defined as a decrease in severity or duration of overall symptoms or of specific symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose, cough, or sneezing. We also investigated whether side effects were more common with the combination treatments than with placebo. Only three studies reported independent financing. We identified three new three new trials (1038 participants) in this 2021 update, bringing the total number of included trials to 30 (6304 participants). The evidence suggests that all combinations have some beneficial effect on overall symptoms of the common cold in adults and older children. There was no effect in younger children. The AH + DC and DC + AN combinations result in more side effects than placebo; however, there was no difference between groups in side effects for the other combinations. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about adverse effects associated with the use of over-the-counter nasal preparations containing phenylpropanolamine. The 30 included studies differed in the way they were conducted, the included participants, the treatments used, and in the way the effect was measured. There was frequently not enough information in the trials to judge the certainty of the evidence.
Although four randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 middle-aged to elderly people, predominantly men. The participants had symptoms of lower limb atherosclerosis, predominantly intermittent claudication. The trials were published from 1967 to 1971 and all took place in Denmark. Testosterone did not provide any clear improvement in the symptoms reported by the participants, walking distance or other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease including leg muscle blood flow. The dose of testosterone in the trials varied between 300 mg taken by mouth every two weeks for three months to a lower (100 mg) oral dose taken more often and 200 mg given by intramuscular injection, first weekly then every two weeks for six months. Side effects were poorly reported except for subjective sexual functioning, which did seem to improve with testosterone treatment. No trials investigated oestrogens in women with lower limb atherosclerosis.
Trials by the Women's Health Initiative (published in 2004) have shown that oestrogen and progestin does not confer any protection against peripheral arterial disease in healthy postmenopausal women or reduce the risk of coronary events in postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease.
This review compares the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors alone, or in combination with antipsychotics, compared with antipsychotics alone, or placebo plus antipsychotics. Adding acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with antipsychotics may improve the general psychopathology/negative symptomatology/depressive symptoms in people with schizophrenia. Also, the combination may be useful in improving the attention/reaction time and memory areas of cognition. The major limitation of the results was that most of the studies found were short-term studies. Considering the chronic, severe and enduring nature of schizophrenia, one cannot get a true picture unless well designed long-term studies are done. We hope that this review will highlight the need for more studies in this area.
This review focuses on travel plans for organisations, such as workplaces or schools. The main reasons for using travel plans are to reduce congestion and to be environmentally friendly, but travel plans are also commonly claimed to improve health. We included 17 studies in this review. One study found that promoting walking in a workplace improved some aspects of health, including mental health, but no other studies directly measured health effects. All 17 studies looked at changes in travel. Although some found that travel plans increased walking, others did not. Overall, there is not enough evidence to know whether travel plans are effective at changing the way people travel, or whether they improve health. Currently, organisational travel plans should be put in place as part of well-designed research studies.
The evidence was updated on 18th November 2022. Ten randomised controlled trials comprising 1413 patients were identified for this review.
The studies were conducted in different parts of the world with 263 patients in the biggest study and 43 in the smallest study. Four studies with a total of 465 patients were conducted in Europe whereas a total of 450 patients were recruited in two studies conducted in North America, Australia and Canada. 498 Chinese patients were studied in four trials, three of which were in single centres and the fourth trial had 23 recruiting centres throughout China. Our analyses show that a prophylactic use of ATG probably has little or no influence on the overall survival of patients who receive an allogeneic SCT.
ATG prophylaxis results in a reduction in the occurrence and severity of acute and chronic GvHD.  
The risk of recurrence of disease after transplantation is probably slightly increased, though ATG prophylaxis probably has little or no effect on the chance of dying from causes other than the underlying disease.
Transplant failure may not be affected by the intervention. 
The effect of ATG on adverse events after SCTwas reported in a descriptive manner. We have moderate confidence in our finding that ATG has little or no influence on overall survival. We have high confidence in our finding that ATG reduces acute and chronic GVHD. We have moderate confidence in our finding that ATG probably slightly increases the incidence of relapse and probably does not affect non-relapse mortality. The addition of ATG may result in no increase in graft failure, but our confidence in the finding is low. All the aforementioned limitations in the certainty of evidence are caused by serious or very serious imprecision.
We have moderate confidence in our analysis on adverse events, although we report in a narrative manner, due to heterogeneity in the reported outcomes.
We systematically reviewed efficacy and safety of factor Xa inhibitors in treating acute coronary syndromes when compared to unfractionated heparins or low molecular weight heparins. A total of four trials involving 27,976 subjects was included. Xa inhibitors reduced all-cause mortality at 30 days, with the effect becoming more significant at 180 days. However, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of myocardial infarction or reinfarction at 30 days. Factor Xa inhibitors were found to be safer than enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin, due to reduced incidences of major and minor bleeding at 30 patients in patients receiving conservative treatment.
We included randomised clinical trials (where people are randomly put into one of two treatment groups) looking at the effects of paracetamol for people with hip or knee pain due to osteoarthritis against a placebo (a 'sugar tablet' that contains nothing that could act as a medicine). We found 10 trials with 3541 participants. On average, participants in the study were aged between 55 and 70 years, and most presented with knee osteoarthritis. The treatment dose ranged from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day of paracetamol and participants were followed up between one and 12 weeks in all but one study, which followed people up for 24 weeks. Six trials were funded by companies that produced paracetamol. Compared with placebo tablets, paracetamol resulted in little benefit at 12 weeks.
Pain (lower scores mean less pain)
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 3.2 points (1 better to 5.4 better) on a 0- to 100-point scale.
• People who took paracetamol reported that their pain improved by 26 points.
• People who took placebo reported that their pain improved by 23 points.
Physical function (lower scores mean better function)
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 2.9 points (1.0 better to 4.9 better) on a 0- to 100-point scale.
• People who took paracetamol reported that their function improved by 15 points.
• People who had placebo reported that their function improved by 12 points.
Side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks)
No more people had side effects with paracetamol (3% less to 3% more), or 0 more people out of 100.
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with paracetamol.
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with placebo.
Serious side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks)
1% more people had serious side effects with paracetamol (0% less to 1% more), or one more person out of 100.
• Two out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with paracetamol.
• One out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with placebo.
Withdrawals due to adverse events (up to 12 to 24 weeks)
1% more people withdrew from treatment with paracetamol (1% less to 3% more), or one more person out of 100.
• Eight out of 100 people withdrew from paracetamol treatment.
• Seven out of 100 people withdrew from placebo treatment.
Abnormal liver function tests (up to 12 to 24 weeks):
5% more people had abnormal liver function tests (meaning there was some inflammation or damage to the liver) with paracetamol (1% more to 10% more), or five more people out of 100.
• Seven out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with paracetamol.
• Two out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with placebo. High-quality evidence indicated that paracetamol provided only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. None of the studies measured quality of life. Due to the small number of events, we were less certain if paracetamol use increased the risk of serious side effects, increased withdrawals due to side effects, and changed the rate of abnormal liver function tests. However, although there may be more abnormal liver function tests with paracetamol, the clinical implications are unknown.
The aim of this review was to assess whether stem cell-based therapies could reduce death and improve the long-term development of newborns born too early. During cell stem-based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance, through injection. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow, or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that have been damaged by bleeding or grey matter damage. We searched medical databases for clinical trials looking at stem cell-based therapies for brain injury in newborns born too soon. We were unable to include any studies in our review. We did identify nine studies, but we excluded them because of the way they were designed, which meant that their results could not answer our review question. This review updates and expands our previous review which was published in 2019. The evidence is current to April 2022.
Providing care from a distance, also called telehealth, is becoming more common, especially since the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using technology to provide remote care could benefit people with inflammatory bowel disease. Telehealth can take place via telephone, instant messaging, video, text message, web-based services, or other means.
We wanted to find which communication technologies are used for remote care in inflammatory bowel disease, how they are used, if they are accessible to everyone, and what are their benefits or drawbacks. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing telehealth with any other treatment for people with inflammatory bowel disease. RCTs give us the highest standard of evidence.
We applied no limitations for age or type of remote care in our search, but we excluded studies that did not focus on providing care, such as studies providing only patient information or education. We also excluded studies that provided remote blood or stool test monitoring with no other type of remote monitoring. We found 19 relevant RCTs, which enroled a combined total of 3489 people aged eight to 95 years. Remote care was delivered online (e.g. smartphone applications, websites) or by telephone.
Twelve studies compared web-based care to usual care, three compared telephone-based care to usual care, three compared web-based care to "sham" care, one compared web-based care to self-care, and one compared psychological and telephone support to usual care.
Web-based remote care is probably no different to usual care in adults for improving symptoms, avoiding relapses or flare-ups, and enhancing quality of life.
We also found that people who receive web-based care are probably less likely to skip their medicines compared to those that receive usual care. We are moderately certain about these results based on the current evidence.
The evidence on children is limited.
With the currently available information, we cannot make any judgements on other parameters such as access to care, whether people with inflammatory bowel disease approve of these programmes and are encouraged to attend appointments, to what degree clinical professionals are involved in them, and costs or time.
The evidence on other forms of remote care was also very limited. One limitation of the evidence was that the RCTs provided unclear descriptions of the remote care programmes, which means that any organisation wishing to copy and adopt these interventions would have difficulty doing so. The descriptions of usual care (the alternative treatment group in many studies) were also unclear. This means that standard care might be different from one study to another, which could make our findings less accurate.
Few studies looked at forms of remote care other than web-based care.
Another limitation is that the different studies measured different results (outcomes) of treatment.
Finally, some studies used poor quality research methods. No further studies comparing web-based care to usual care in adults are necessary, unless they last for longer periods of time or give more details that would help clinicians adopt them anywhere in the world. This includes details on the type and number of staff needed, resources, equipment, costs, accessibility, and data security. More studies on children may be useful, as well as studies that examine differences based on sex and social or financial status. In any case, future studies should concentrate on measuring the results that matter most to people with inflammatory bowel disease and their care providers. This review is up-to-date as of January 2022.
In March 2018 we searched for clinical trials where ear drops were used to help soften and remove build up of ear wax in patients' ears. We found and included 10 studies with a total of 623 participants. However, only six of these studies provided data with which we could analyse our primary outcome, the proportion of patients with complete ear wax clearance. These six studies included a total of 360 participants, both children and adults (of all ages), with partial or full blockage of the external ear canal with ear wax. The 10 included studies looked at either oil-based drops (triethanolamine polypeptide, almond oil, benzocaine, chlorobutanol), water-based drops (docusate sodium, carbamide peroxide, phenazone, choline salicylate, urea peroxide, potassium carbonate), saline (salty water) or water alone, or no treatment.
Only one study compared using drops with an active ingredient to not using drops at all. The drops may help increase the proportion of ears cleared of wax from 1 in 20 (if you do nothing) to about 1 in 5 (if you use drops).
We did not find any evidence that water-based or oil-based drops were any different to saline or water. However, we also did not find any evidence that water or saline were better than doing nothing.
Adverse (side) effects were not common. Fewer than 30 patients reported any adverse events when using the drops and these were mild (such as slight irritation or pain, or unpleasant smell). No serious side effects were reported by any participant. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low , low , moderate or high quality . High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. For wax clearance, we rated the quality of the evidence as low . For adverse effects we rated the quality of the evidence as low. We have found that using ear drops when you have a partially or completely blocked ear canal may help to remove the ear wax in your ear. It is not clear whether one type of drop is any better than another, or whether drops containing active ingredients are any better than plain or salty water.
The evidence is current to February 2019. We found three studies that included 3851 participants. Two studies took place in the US and one study in the UK.
One study tested whether delirium could be prevented by calculating how much fluid an older person in a care home needs each day and ensuring hydration was maintained. There were 98 people in the study, which lasted four weeks.
One study tested the effect of a computer program which searched for prescriptions of medications that might increase the chance of developing delirium, to enable a pharmacist to adjust or stop them. There were 3538 people in the study, which lasted 12 months.
One study tested an enhanced educational intervention which included learning sessions on delirium with care home staff and group meetings to identity targets for preventing delirium. There were 215 people in the study, which lasted 16 months. It was not possible to determine if the hydration intervention reduced the occurrence of delirium. This was a small study of short duration with serious design problems.
The study of a computerised medication search programme probably reduced delirium, but there was no clear reduction in hospital admissions, deaths or falls. A potential problem is that it might not be possible to use this computer program in different countries that do not have similar computer systems available.
It was not possible to determine if the enhanced education intervention reduced the occurrence of delirium and there was no clear reduction in the number of deaths. The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions. This is based on findings from a small study. There is very low-quality evidence on the effectiveness of hydration interventions for reducing the incidence of delirium. Therefore, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions.
There is moderate-quality evidence that a computerised medication search programme may reduce the incidence of delirium. There is no clear evidence for reducing hospitalisations, mortality or falls.
There is very low-quality evidence of the effectiveness of an enhanced educational intervention for reducing delirium. Therefore, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions. There is moderate-quality evidence for reducing hospital admissions.
As this review only found a small number of research studies, we recommend that further research be conducted, testing different ways of preventing delirium for older people in LTC.
We included 7 randomised controlled trials, involving 239 people with emotionalism, in the review, which reported on the use of antidepressants for treating emotionalism. The numbers of people included in the studies ranged from 10 to 92. The mean/median ages ranged from 57.8 years to 73 years. Studies were from Europe (UK: 1; Denmark: 1; Scotland: 1; and Sweden: 1); Asia (South Korea: 1 and Japan: 1); and the USA (1). We did not identify any new studies in our search update. We included 7 studies involving 239 people. However, 2 studies were not available in the appropriate format to include in the analysis. Therefore, we included only 5 studies, with 213 people, in our analyses. It is uncertain whether antidepressants affect the number of people with at least a 50% reduction in emotional displays, tearfulness, and scores on the questionnaires that measure uncontrollable laughing or crying, but they had no effect on lability (frequency of mood changes) scores and whether a clinician thought there had been an improvement when compared to placebo. No studies of other types of medicine were found. Six studies reported death and found no differences between those who were on antidepressants and those who were not. Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low, and the results of further research could differ from the results of this review. Our confidence is limited because the included studies were small, and there was no consistency in how emotionalism was measured across the studies. It is uncertain whether antidepressant medicines reduce outbursts of crying or laughing. More studies with systematic assessment and reporting of unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment are needed to ensure that any benefits outweigh the risks.
We found some low quality evidence to suggest that HBOT relieves pain with acute migraine headaches and possibly cluster headaches, and that NBOT may relieve pain with cluster headache. We found no evidence that either treatment can prevent future attacks. Many migraines can be treated simply with appropriate drug therapy, so further research is needed to help choose the most appropriate patients (if any) to receive HBOT.
We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID-19 is uncertain.
We evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on:
– people dying;
– whether people's COVID-19 got better or worse;
– quality of life;
– serious and non-serious unwanted effects;
– viral clearance.
For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.
In this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria.
We compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo.
For treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID-19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment.
No trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published.  We do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment:
– leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people); 
– worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people);
– increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people).
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to:
– improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people);
– non-serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants).
Seven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID-19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care. Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people).
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people).
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to:
– worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people);
– serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people); 
– non-serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants); 
– improving people's COVID-19 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people);
– number of people with negative COVID-19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people). Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high-quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes. The systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022.
There are no new studies to include in this updated review. Our original review included one study, based in the Netherlands, that compared the treatment of people at high risk of endocarditis who did or did not develop bacterial endocarditis. The authors collected information on 48 people who had contracted bacterial endocarditis over a specific two-year period and had undergone a medical or dental procedure with an indication for prophylaxis within the past 180 days. These people were matched to a similar group of people who had not contracted bacterial endocarditis. All study participants had undergone an invasive medical or dental procedure. The two groups were compared to establish whether those who had received preventive antibiotics were less likely to have developed endocarditis. It is unclear whether taking antibiotics as a preventive measure before undergoing invasive dental procedures is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at increased risk.
We found no studies that assessed numbers of deaths, serious adverse events requiring hospital admission, other adverse effects, or cost implications of treatment.
It is unclear whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effects. Ethically, practitioners should discuss the potential benefits and harms of preventive antibiotic treatment with their patients before a decision is made about whether to prescribe it. The evidence is based on one study that has some limitations in its design. For example, the participants who received antibiotics may have been in worse general health than those who did not. We are not confident about the evidence we found. We can only conclude that we do not know the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis. This review updates one carried out originally in 2004 and last revised in 2013. It is now up to date to 10 May 2021.
The evidence is current to August 2014. We included eight clinical trials of 952 participants. The trials assessed many different medicines at different doses, but only three trials included a placebo group (dummy medication). Six of these trials were of high quality, with low risk of error (i.e. bias, where the true effect is exaggerated). For this review, we included the effects of the medicines on nausea and vomiting up to one hour after the medicine was given. The main results of interest were the effect on nausea between zero and 60 minutes after the medicine was given, number of vomits and side effects to medicines. Of these, only nausea at 30 minutes and side effects were reported by all trials. From all trials, only one medicine was reported to be better than placebo and other medicines. That was droperidol, which was included in one small trial of 97 participants. No other single medicine was definitely better than any other medicine, and none of the other trials that included a placebo group showed that the active medicines definitely worked better than the placebo. Side effects were mild.
Our results suggest that in people in the emergency department, nausea will generally improve, whether they are treated with specific medicines or placebo. Therefore, supportive treatment, such as intravenous fluids (where fluid is given directly into a blood vessel) may be sufficient for many people. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low, mainly because there was not enough data.
We found that there was not much evidence on the effects of using email to give people information on disease prevention and health promotion. We found only six trials with 8372 participants in total. All of the trials had elements of bias. Four studies compared email to standard mail as a method of communication, and found that using email instead of mail did not make any difference to patient or caregiver understanding, or the uptake of preventive screening. Two studies compared email with usual care, and found that using email instead of usual methods of information delivery did make any difference to patient or caregiver understanding and support, or patient health status and well-being. We were unable to properly assess email's impact on patient or caregiver behaviours/actions as the results were mixed.
As there is a lack of good quality evidence for whether email can be used by healthcare professionals to provide information to patients or caregivers on how to stay healthy and avoid disease, we need to think about how to get good measurable information on this. Future studies should follow advice on good ways of carrying out and presenting research. It would be useful if they could look at the costs of using email and take into account ongoing changes in technology.
This review included 12 studies that comprised a total of 1837 participants. Eleven studies that included 1826 participants contributed to the quantitative syntheses. Participants were all adults, but ranged in demographics and trauma types. All studies recruited participants in the United States and there was a predominance of studies conducted on military veterans. PCT does not appear to be as effective as trauma focused treatments in reducing PTSD severity at post-treatment. However, PCT is associated with reduced treatment dropout rates compared to TF-CBT. Several of the TF-CBT trials included in this review were well designed and executed. However, we assessed the overall quality of evidence for our primary outcome (post-treatment PTSD severity) as low based on inconsistent outcomes and some imprecision in the results. We rated the quality of the evidence on differential treatment dropout as moderate.
This review examined whether caffeine improves the pain-relieving effects of such medicines. We searched for studies up to August 2014 and included twenty studies (7238 participants) examining several pain conditions, including headache, post-dental pain, postoperative pain following childbirth, and menstrual period pain. The studies were generally of good methodological quality, using standard designs and mostly standard scales of pain measurement. Many of those in post-dental and postoperative pain were small, and small studies can overestimate benefits.
A dose of caffeine equivalent to a mug of coffee added to a standard dose of common analgesics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen provided better pain relief. Analgesic plus caffeine increased the number of people who had a good level of pain relief by 5% to 10% compared with analgesic alone (high quality evidence).
No serious adverse events were reported that were related to either the analgesic or caffeine in these studies (low quality evidence). It is unlikely that adding caffeine to an analgesic will be harmful if the recommended dose is not exceeded.
We searched evidence up to October 2017 and included 10 clinical trials with 1656 participants. The trials lasted between three months and five years. All trials used at least one laboratory method for diagnosis. Four trials compared vaginal suppository (solid medicine inserted directly into the vagina) or tablet of clotrimazole (antifungal medicine) plus vaginal capsules of probiotics with vaginal suppository or tablet of clotrimazole alone. Three trials compared vaginal suppository of miconazole (antifungal medicine) plus vaginal capsules of probiotics with vaginal suppository of miconazole alone. Two trials compared oral fluconazole (antifungal medicine) plus oral capsules of probiotics with oral fluconazole plus oral capsules of placebo (pretend treatment). One trial compared oral fluconazole and vaginal fenticonazole (antifungal medicines) with oral fluconazole plus vaginal fenticonazole plus probiotic. Compared with conventional antifungal drugs used alone, probiotics as adjuvant therapy could enhance their effect in improving the rate of short-term (within five to 10 days) clinical cure, short-term mycological cure (no abnormal laboratory results) and relapse at one month (recurrence of problems), but does not seem to influence the rate of long-term (within one to three months) clinical cure, long-term mycological cure, serious and non-serious side events.
However, because of the low quality of evidence available, there is insufficient evidence for the use of probiotics as adjuvants to conventional antifungal medicines or used alone for the treatment of VVC in non-pregnant women. The quality of the evidence was low or very low in this review, so we have very little confidence in the results.
For the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, the evidence does not support the use of urine tests for Down's syndrome screening. The amount of evidence is limited. These tests are not offered in routine clinical practice. The urine tests themselves have no adverse effects for the woman. However, some women who have a ‘high risk’ screening test result, and are given amniocentesis or CVS have a risk of miscarrying a baby unaffected by Down’s. Parents will need to weigh up this risk when deciding whether or not to have an amniocentesis or CVS following a ‘high risk’ screening test result.
We looked for all research studies (randomised controlled trials) published up to July 2018. We found six studies which included 221 participants, with an average age ranging from 59 to 70 years. These studies included different numbers of people, ranging from 20 to 111. Our results showed that, compared to those who did not exercise, people with lung cancer who did exercise were fitter and had a better quality of life. We did not find any difference in muscle strength, shortness of breath, tiredness, feelings of anxiety and depression, or lung function. No serious harms were reported in people with lung cancer who exercised, but only three studies talked about harms. The results of this review are not clear, mainly because of the small number of studies found, the small numbers of people in those studies, and because the studies did not seem to have been carried out to a high standard.
We searched published and unpublished studies up to January 2017. We found 33 clinical trials with a total of 4477 participants; most were published in the 1980s and 1990s and were carried out in European countries. Eleven out of 33 studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies. Most studies included patients over 60 years old who had severe blocking of arteries of the leg; many also had diabetes. Follow-up was usually less than 1 year. We found that, when compared with placebo, prostanoids provided a small beneficial effect by alleviating pain in the leg at rest and improving ulcer healing. Prostanoids did not reduce deaths or the need for an amputation. We found that no studies evaluated the quality of life of people with this condition. We found insufficient evidence to compare effects of prostanoids against those of other medications or other prostanoids.
Our findings suggest that taking prostanoids does cause harm. When 1000 patients are treated with prostanoids, on average 674 (572 to 798) will experience adverse events, compared with 319 given placebo. Adverse events usually include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, and flushing. More severe adverse events include low blood pressure, chest pain, and abnormalities in heart rhythm. When evaluating effects of prostanoids on rest-pain, ulcer healing, and adverse events, researchers provided moderate-quality evidence; review authors downgraded this in most cases because of loss of participants to follow-up. Evaluating cardiovascular mortality yielded evidence of low quality related to loss of participants to follow-up and small numbers of reported events. On the other hand, the quality of evidence on risk of amputation was high.
This review includes three randomised controlled trials with a total of 131 participants and two of them only included children. Two of the trials compared supplements to dietary advice and one compared supplements to no advice. The trials lasted between three months and one year. There were no major differences between people receiving supplements or just dietary advice for any nutritional or growth measurements. This was also true for measures of body composition, lung function, adverse effects on the digestive system or people's levels of activity. Advice and monitoring appear to be enough to manage the diet of moderately malnourished children.
Future trials should look into the use of calorie supplements for acute weight loss or long-term care for adults with cystic fibrosis. One of the trials appeared to be well run and the risk of bias was low for all the aspects of trial design that we assessed; so we do not think any bias will influence the results in a negative way. In the other two trials, we were not sure if the people taking part could guess which treatment group they were in. In one of these two trials, we further thought it was likely that the person recruiting them to the trial knew which group the participant would be in. In the second of these trials, the people in the group receiving supplements appeared to be generally in better clinical condition at the start of the trial than those who didn't receive any supplements or advice. These factors affect our confidence in the results from these trials.
We judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in weight and height to be moderate, but judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as low since results are applicable only to children aged between 2 and 15 years; also many post-treatment diet diaries were not returned to the investigators. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality.
This review considered the efficacy, acceptability and adverse effects of olanzapine in long-term treatment of bipolar disorder in comparison with placebo or other active drug comparisons. Five trials (1165 participants) met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. Based on a limited amount of information, olanzapine may prevent further mood episodes (especially manic relapse) in patients who responded to olanzapine during an index manic or mixed episode and who have not previously had a satisfactory response to lithium or valproate. The olanzapine group had significantly fewer patients suffering from insomnia than the placebo group, but a significantly larger number of people suffering from weight gain. When compared with lithium, olanzapine caused more weight gain and depressive symptoms but fewer insomnia and nausea symptoms and a lower rate of manic worsening. However, considering the lack of clear findings of this review, conclusions on efficacy and acceptability of olanzapine compared to placebo, lithium or valproate cannot be made with any degree of confidence
This review of trials found high dose inhaled corticosteroids help treat mild episodic viral wheeze of childhood. There is no evidence to support the use of maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroids to prevent or manage episodic mild wheeze caused by a virus. More research is needed.
We included four trials randomising 84 children with hospital-acquired pneumonia to different antibiotic regimens. Three trials were multicentre trials from the USA, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. The South African trial included one site in Malaysia. Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. Three trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacia Corp, and Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd.), indicating a possible risk of bias related to a vested interest risk. Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin.
Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of death from all causes and serious adverse events (major complications). Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community-acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital-acquired pneumonia constituted only subgroups of the total study populations.
Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We were unable to draw any meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.
None of the included trials assessed health-related quality of life, pneumonia-related death, or non-serious adverse events (minor complications). The available evidence does not suggest that one antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective than another in treating newborns and children with hospital-acquired pneumonia. Further research is needed. The certainty of evidence is very low. All four included trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the studies were designed in such a way that the results may have been skewed). In addition, the included trials involved few participants, which is likely to have led to inaccurate results.
We reviewed the medical literature up to April 2015, and found 11 studies that included a total of 1817 people. Nine studies investigated the effects of medication (i.e. levodopa-carbidopa, memantine, rasagiline, caffeine, methylphenidate, modafinil or doxepin) on fatigue. Two studies investigated the effects of exercise on fatigue. We found no studies that investigated the effect of cognitive-behavioural therapy.
We found that doxepin (one study, 12 people, low quality evidence), a drug to treat depression, may reduce fatigue. We found that rasagiline (one study, 1176 people, high quality evidence), an anti-Parkinson drug, reduced or slowed down the progression of physical fatigue. Most drugs were safe; however, levodopa-carbidopa (one study, 361 people, high quality evidence) may cause nausea.
We found no evidence that exercise (two studies, 57 people, low quality evidence) reduces fatigue in Parkinson's disease.
Based on the current evidence, it is not clear what treatment is most effective to treat fatigue in people with Parkinson's disease. Future studies should investigate the effect of cognitive-behavioural therapy on fatigue in people with Parkinson's disease.
Evidence for the management of topical treatments for management of dermatophyte infections of the toenails was sparser and the studies are small. There was some evidence that ciclopiroxolamine and butenafine are both effective but they both needed to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year).
We identified 20 randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to a treatment group using a random method) (2853 analytic units consisting of 1681 individual patients and 1172 individual legs) in our most recent search on 12 June 2018. Nine trials compared wearing stockings to no stockings, and 11 compared stockings plus another method with that method alone. The other methods used were dextran 70, aspirin, heparin, and mechanical sequential compression. Of the 20 trials, 10 included patients undergoing general surgery; six included patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery; three individual trials included patients undergoing neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, and gynaecological surgery, respectively; and only one trial included medical patients (patients who were admitted to the hospital for reasons other than surgery). The compression stockings were applied on the day before surgery or on the day of surgery and were worn up until discharge or until the patients were fully mobile. Thigh-length stockings were used in the vast majority of included studies. The included studies were of good quality overall. We found that wearing GCS reduced the overall risk of developing DVT, and probably also DVT in the thighs. We found that GCS may also reduce the risk of PE amongst patients undergoing surgery. As only one trial included medical patients, results for this population are limited. The occurrence of problems associated with wearing GCS was poorly reported in the included studies. Our review confirmed that GCS are effective in reducing the risk of DVT in hospitalised surgical patients (high-quality evidence). It also demonstrated that GCS probably reduce the risk of developing DVT in the thighs (proximal DVT, moderate-quality evidence) and PE (low-quality evidence). Reasons for downgrading the quality of the evidence included low event rate (i.e. small number of participants who developed DVT) and uncertainty due to only a small number of patients being routinely screened for proximal DVT or PE. Limited evidence was available for hospitalised medical patients, with only one study suggesting that GCS may prevent DVT in such patients.
After extensive searching up to May 2015 to find all relevant medical studies that might provide evidence about whether NPWT is an effective treatment for leg ulcers, we found only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that was eligible for this review. (RCTs provide more robust results than most other trial types.) The study was small with 60 participants who had hard-to-heal ulcers. The average age of these participants was 73 years, and 77% of them were women. The study was funded by the manufacturer of the NPWT machine. The study explored the use of NPWT in preparing leg ulcers for a skin graft. In the study, the ulcers were treated with NPWT or with normal (standard) care until the wounds were considered ready to have a skin graft applied. The study's results are not relevant for leg ulcers that are not being prepared for skin grafts. Participants remained in hospitals during treatment and until their wounds healed.
There was low evidence from this study that ulcers treated with NPWT healed more quickly than those treated with standard care (dressings and compression). There was also evidence that ulcers treated with NPWT became ready for skin grafting more quickly than those treated with standard care. There were very limited results for other outcomes such as adverse events (harms) and it was not clear how information about adverse effects was collected. Twelve ulcers recurred (broke out again) in the NPWT group and 10 recurred in the standard care group.
The evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT in treating leg ulcers is very limited, and at present consists of only one study with 60 participants. This study provided evidence that NPWT may reduce time to healing as part of a treatment that includes a skin graft. At present, no RCTs have investigated the effectiveness of NPWT as a main treatment for leg ulcers.
This plain language summary is up-to-date as of May 2015.
We identified 99 studies (265 records; 8956 participants; 33 with contemporary agents). From the available studies in this area, an antibody against human immune cells (ATG) reduces the chances of a patient having a kidney rejection by one-third, but it is uncertain whether this prolongs the function of the kidney transplant or survival for the patient. ATG significantly increases viral infections including cytomegalovirus. In addition, the effects of ATG treatment on cancer are not well understood. Alemtuzumab is another treatment which has been compared to ATG in patients who have received less or no steroid therapy as part of their transplant treatment. Treatment with alemtuzumab with lower steroid doses or no steroid treatment at all may lower a patient's risk of kidney rejection within a year after transplantation when compared to ATG but overall the information about treatment benefits and harms of alemtuzumab in many clinical situations are not certain. This means we are not confident about the effects of alemtuzumab on kidney function, patient survival or treatment side-effects. Overall the available research on antibody treatment for kidney transplantation is limited when clinicians and patients make joint decisions about antibody therapy at the time of a kidney transplant because of the uncertain long term benefits and hazards of these treatments.
The review found there was not enough evidence from trials to assess the effects of the range of drugs used to try and relieve spasticity after spinal cord injury. The authors of the review call for more research and make recommendations as to how this research should be conducted.
In this updated review, we included a total of 12 studies (including five new studies), involving 1954 participants. Six Chinese herbal medicines may facilitate the improvement of symptoms and increase the rate of recovery. Two studies separately reported one case of diarrhoea and one case of mild nausea; two trials reported no adverse events in the treatment group; and other studies did not report any adverse events. We identified ten studies as being of poor methodological quality and only two studies as being of medium methodological quality. Chinese medicinal herbs may be the treatment choice for sore throat, but we cannot recommend any particular preparation or formulation over another as we did not find any well-designed studies to provide strong evidence to conclusively support or reject the use of Chinese traditional herbal medicines in the treatment of sore throat. Enhancing the quality of research into Chinese medicinal herbs for sore throat is imperative, and stronger evidence from high quality, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed.
We wanted to find out whether steroids were better than placebo (sham or dummy treatment) or no treatment for children with OME.
We also wanted to see if there were any unwanted effects associated with taking steroids. We searched for studies that compared steroids taken as a tablet or nasal spray with placebo or no treatment in children with OME. We compared and summarised the study results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 26 studies, including 2770 children.
Oral steroids compared to placebo
We found that oral steroids probably make little or no difference to the number of children who have normal hearing after one year of follow-up. Normal hearing was seen in 69.7% of children who received steroids and 61.1% of children who received placebo. There is also likely to be very little or no difference between the two groups in quality of life (related to glue ear).
The evidence suggests that oral steroids might reduce the number of children who have glue ear after 6 to 12 months of follow-up, but the results from the studies were very different - so we do not know how big the reduction might be. The evidence on side effects of oral steroids was not robust. From the evidence in this review we were not able to determine what the chance of side effects would be.
Oral steroids compared to no treatment
We found fewer studies here, and there was no information on hearing or quality of life. After up to nine months, there may be little or no difference in the number of children who still have glue ear (74.5% of children who received steroids, compared to 73% of those who received no treatment). Again, the evidence on side effects was not robust.
Nasal steroids compared to placebo
We are unsure whether nasal steroids have any effect on hearing, as the evidence was not robust. Nasal steroids may make little or no difference to quality of life after nine months of follow-up. We are uncertain whether nasal steroids affect the number of children with persistent glue ear at up to one year, as the evidence from two studies was conflicting. We are not sure whether there may be a risk of harm with this treatment, as the studies did not clearly report side effects.
Nasal steroids compared to no treatment
We only have information on hearing at up to four weeks of follow-up, which may not be long enough to really assess this treatment. However, at this stage, there might be little or no difference in hearing between children who receive nasal steroids or no treatment. We are also unsure whether nasal steroids affect the number of children with persistent glue ear after eight weeks. We did not identify any information on quality of life or side effects of treatment from these studies. The studies used lots of different types of medication, for different lengths of time. We do not know if some of these may be more effective than others. We do not have good evidence on side effects of these treatments, but they may cause problems for some children. The evidence is up-to-date to January 2023.
We searched medical databases for studies of topiramate compared with placebo (a pretend tablet) or any other medicine in adults with essential tremor. We found three studies comparing topiramate versus placebo, involving 309 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor. The effect of topiramate on daily activities, risk of stopping treatment and side effects was uncertain because the quality of evidence was very low to low. We only found a few studies that had problems with their methods so we could not make firm conclusions about how well topiramate works and if it has side effects.
Only one trial was identified. In this trial enrolling infants with gram-negative meningitis and ventriculitis, the use of intraventricular antibiotics in addition to intravenous antibiotics resulted in a three-fold increased risk for mortality compared to standard treatment with intravenous antibiotics alone. Based on this result, intraventricular antibiotics should be avoided. Further trials comparing these interventions are not justified in newborn infants.
We reviewed studies that compared these two highly effective methods and found the IUD to be better at preventing pregnancy than depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). Relevant to HIV positive women are the results of one small trial that found that women using the IUD for contraception where less likely to experience a worsening of their HIV disease than those using hormonal contraception. A large, high quality study is urgently needed to shed light on these findings.
We included 17 studies, with a total of 1025 participants. Sixteen studies including 953 people compared betahistine with placebo; the studies were at high to unclear risk of bias. All studies with analysable data lasted three months or less. One study, at high risk of bias, included 72 people with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and compared betahistine with placebo; all patients also had particle repositioning manoeuvres. We judged the quality of evidence overall to be low.
The studies varied considerably in terms of types of participants, their diagnoses, the dose of betahistine and the length of time the drug was taken for, the study methods and the way any improvement in vertigo symptoms was measured. When all studies are taken together, the proportion of patients reporting a reduction of their vertigo symptoms was significantly higher in the betahistine group than in the placebo group. However, there was significant variability in the results of the studies so this result should be treated with caution.
The proportion of patients reporting side effects of the medication was similar in both groups: 16% in the betahistine groups and 15% in the placebo groups. Overall, 16% of patients of both groups withdrew from the studies.
There was insufficient information about the effect of betahistine on objective tests of inner ear balance organ function. There was no information on the effect of betahistine on overall quality of life or falls. We judged the quality of evidence from the included studies to be low, meaning our estimates of the effects of betahistine could turn out to be inaccurate. The evidence is up to date to September 2015. Low quality evidence suggests that patients suffering from vertigo from different causes may have some benefit from betahistine in terms of reduction in vertigo symptoms. Betahistine is generally well tolerated. Future research into the management of vertigo symptoms needs to use more rigorous methodology and include outcomes that matter to patients and their families.
Evidence from a large and small trial showed that advice to reduce salt helps to maintain lower blood pressure following withdrawal of antihypertensive medication. If this is confirmed, with no increase in cardiovascular events, then comprehensive dietary and behavioural programmes in patients with elevated blood pressure requiring drug treatment would be justified.
See also the Cochrane review of short-term salt reduction trials: Jurgens 2003.
We searched databases for studies up to the October 2018, and found 15 studies with 7976 children. Eight studies were conducted in Malawi, four in India, and one apiece in Kenya, Zambia, and Cambodia. One small study included only children infected with HIV, another study analysed children with and without HIV separately for the main outcome (recovery), while the other studies included children who were not infected with HIV or who were untested. Overall, we judged six studies to be at high risk of bias, three studies to be at unclear risk of bias, and six studies to be at low risk of bias. (With 'risk of bias', we mean the extent to which the methods used in a study enable it to determine the truth.) All the studies lasted between 8 and 16 weeks. Only five studies followed up children after the study (for a maximum of six months), and generally reported on a limited number of outcomes.
Of our 15 included studies, six were linked to funding or donations from industry, one did not report the source of funding, and eight studies reported funding where sponsors did not include industry. Compared to alternative dietary approaches, standard RUTF probably improves recovery (moderate-quality evidence) and may increase the rate of weight gain slightly (low-quality evidence), but the effects on relapse and death are unknown (very low-quality evidence). With 'quality of evidence' we mean how confident we are that the particular finding represents the true effect. For example, 'very low-quality' means we are very uncertain about the finding, 'low-quality evidence' means the future research is very likely to change the finding, 'moderate-quality evidence' means that future studies may change this finding, and 'high-quality evidence' means that it is unlikely that future studies will change the finding.
Standard RUTF meeting total daily nutritional requirements may improve recovery and relapse compared to a similar RUTF given supplementary to the usual diet (low-quality evidence), but for death and the rate of weight gain, the effects are not known (very low-quality evidence).
When comparing RUTFs of different formulations, it makes little or no difference for recovery whether a standard or alternative formulation RUTF is used (high-quality evidence). For relapse, using standard RUTF decreases relapse (high-quality evidence). It probably makes little or no difference to death (moderate-quality evidence) and to the rate of weight gain (low-quality evidence) whether standard or alternative formulation RUTF is used.
Well-designed, randomised controlled trials (experimental studies where participants meeting the inclusion criteria have an equal chance of being allocated to any of the intervention or control groups) in which analyses have been performed separately for children with and without HIV, and that also measure and report on diarrhoea occurrence, are needed.
We included 21 randomised controlled trials that compared non-surgical treatments to placebo, no treatment, or to surgery. All the participants had leg pain and a confirmed diagnosis of lumbar stenosis. There were 1851 people, with an average age of 50 years, equally divided between men and women. The follow-up time ranged from one week to six years. The evidence was current to June 2012. Overall, the review suggests that surgery is more effective at relieving pain than non-surgical treatments.
Medicines taken by mouth. One small trial each of prostaglandins (compared to another medicine), gabapentin (compared to placebo), and vitamin B1 (compared to a variety of treatments) suggested improvements in pain and walking distance. Some digestive problems were reported with both medicines in the prostaglandins trial; and some people in the gabapentin trial reported dizziness or sleepiness.
Epidural injections. Two small trials showed short-term improvements in pain and quality of life (up to two weeks) and two showed no difference compared with placebo injections. No trial reported bad reactions or problems.
Calcitonin injections. Six small trials indicated that calcitonin is no better than paracetemol or placebo. A number of people reported feeling sick or developed a rash.
Mixed approaches compared to surgery. Five trials compared results from surgery with results from a variety of non-surgical treatments. One trial found that after two years there was no difference between treatments as far as pain was concerned. The other four found that surgery improved pain more than non-surgical treatments over different time periods, but not necessarily walking ability. Between 5% and 18% suffered unwanted side effects from surgery, some serious.
Physical therapy. Four small trials, all including some form of exercise, failed to demonstrate improved walking ability after physical therapy. One trial each suggested that exercise is better than no treatment for leg pain, and that treadmill walking and stationary cycling produce similar, limited results. The findings of all the trials in this study were based on low or very low-quality evidence. The studies were poorly designed, or they failed to give enough information about what was done. This means that we cannot be confident that the findings are reliable, and further research may well come to a different conclusion.
In this updated review we included 38 controlled trials comparing LOD with medical ovulation induction or comparing different techniques of LOD. The evidence is current to October 2019 Our main analysis with low-quality evidence shows that LOD with and without medical ovulation induction may decrease the live birth rate slightly in women with anovulatory PCOS and CC-resistance compared with medical ovulation induction alone. Analysis including only the higher-quality RCTs shows uncertainty about any difference between the treatments. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following medical ovulation induction alone is 44%, the chance following LOD would be between 32% and 52%. Moderate-quality evidence shows that LOD probably reduces the number of multiple pregnancies. The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a multiple pregnancy following medical ovulation induction alone to be 5.0%, the chance following LOD would be between 0.9% and 3.4%.
There may be little or no difference between the treatments for clinical pregnancy, and there is uncertainty about the effect of LOD compared with ovulation induction alone on miscarriage. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) may occur less often following LOD.
The quality of the evidence is not sufficient to justify a conclusion on live birth, clinical pregnancy or miscarriage for the analysis of unilateral LOD versus bilateral LOD.
The results of the primary outcomes for the other interventions were insufficient to enable us to draw any conclusions. The evidence was of very low to moderate quality. The main limitations in the evidence were poor reporting of study methods, the presence of bias introduced by the selection of individuals and variability in the results.
We found 30 trials involving 4691 participants, examining several types of contracts. The main health problems targeted were substance addictions, hypertension and overweight. Many of the trials were of poor quality and involved small numbers of people. Most were conducted in the USA. In 15 of the trials there was at least one outcome showing statistically significant differences in favour of the contracts group (although some of the improvements in adherence did not remain when measured after a longer period). In six trials at least one outcome showed such differences in favour of the control group. In 26 trials there was at least one outcome for which there was no difference between the contract and control groups.
There is not enough reliable evidence available to recommend the routine use of contracts in health services to improve patients' adherence to healthcare activities or other outcomes.
Warfarin is commonly prescribed to prevent blot clots in patients with medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement or previous blood clots. Warfarin is an effective treatment which has been used for many years but needs to be closely monitored, especially at the beginning of treatment, as there is a wide variation in response to dose. Monitoring of the response to dose is done using an International Normalized Ratio (INR) and it is important that patients remain within a narrow range (typically 2 to 3 INR) due to the need to balance the goal of preventing blood clots with the risk of causing excessive bleeding.
This review included 12 randomised controlled trials comparing different warfarin doses given to patients beginning warfarin treatment. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias so the results were interpreted with caution.
Those trials that were included compared loading doses in several different situations. The review authors divided the trials into four categories, 5 mg versus 10 mg initial doses (four studies), 5 mg versus other doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus age adjusted doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus genotype adjusted doses (four studies).
The review authors concluded that there is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype adjusted dosing. We also found no data to suggest that any one method was safer than another.
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to September 2020. We included 16 studies involving 1110 infants with withdrawal symptoms as a result of their mothers’ use of opioids whilst pregnant. Eleven of the 16 included studies have taken place in the USA. Australia, Germany, Iran, Scotland and Switzerland contributed one study each. We considered seven studies likely to produce reliable results (at low risk of bias). All studies were relatively small and most included infants of mothers using opioids as well as other drugs of dependence. Some of the formulations used to treat the infants in the included studies do not meet regulatory guidance for safety in infants.
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological interventions alone compared to non-pharmacological interventions plus a pharmacological agent (drug such as opioid or sedative) for treatment of NAS. A single trial reported that the addition of an opioid (morphine) to supportive treatments, compared to supportive treatments alone, increased duration of hospitalisation and treatment, but reduced the number of days to regain birthweight and the duration of supportive care each day.
Evidence from six trials found that the use of an opioid may reduce treatment failure rate, compared to the use of the sedatives phenobarbital or diazepam. Treatment failure means failure to achieve control of symptoms, defined as a failure to reduce a standardised score of NAS from a clinically significant level to a clinically 'safe' level. In addition, evidence from these six trials showed that the use of an opioid may have little or no effect on the duration of hospitalisation or treatment compared to the use of the sedatives phenobarbital or diazepam. There was little or no difference in treatment failure according to the type of opioid used (morphine, methadone or buprenorphine). However, use of the opioid buprenorphine probably reduces the duration of hospitalisation and duration of treatment compared to morphine. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of clonidine, a sedative.
We identified six ongoing studies and four studies awaiting classification, whose results have not been included in this review. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low for the majority of outcomes reported. There is moderate certainty that treatment failure is reduced by the use of an opioid compared to the use of the sedatives phenobarbital or chlorpromazine. There is moderate certainty that the use of sublingual (under the tongue) buprenorphine reduces duration of treatment and hospitalisation compared to the use of morphine.
Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia were identified in the original version of this review in 2006 and no new trials in this or previous updates. One trial included 43 ocular myasthenia participants treated with corticotropin (a type of corticosteroid) or placebo. The other only included three participants with ocular myasthenia and seven with generalised myasthenia gravis who were treated with intranasal neostigmine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) or placebo. Neither trial enabled us to draw firm conclusions regarding how effective these treatments were in preventing progression to the development of generalised myasthenia gravis or in improving ocular symptoms. Several reasonably good quality non-randomised studies favor the use of corticosteroids and azathioprine but these and other agents need to be tested in well-designed RCTs.
We did not find any trials that we could include in this review. In an earlier version of this review, we had already found the protocol for a trial that has now published its results, but we have excluded the trial in this version of the review because it did not look at the right topic after all. Although no trials were identified in which people taking part would have equal chances of being in either group, there are several studies which are not so strictly designed which support current policy recommendations for genetic risk assessment prior to pregnancy in routine clinical practice. We recommend considering potential observational studies in future reviews as well as looking at ‘expanded carrier screening’ before pregnancy and not just screening for one condition. Any future trials need to consider legal, ethical and cultural barriers to implementing genetic risk assessment before pregnancy.
We searched for studies comparing giving versus not giving empiric antibiotics or comparing different antibiotics in those with suspected meningococcal disease. We found one randomised trial comparing single intramuscular doses of two different long-acting antibiotics. The evidence is current to January 2017.
The included study was conducted in nine primary care facilities in Niger during an outbreak of meningococcal disease in 2003. Of 510 adults and children studied, 251 received ceftriaxone and 259 received chloramphenicol. The study was funded by Médecins Sans Frontières. There was no difference in the number of people who died, did not respond to treatment, or with neurological disabilities with either antibiotic empirically. The results were similar in whom the diagnosis was subsequently confirmed. Neither antibiotic had significant adverse effects. Although the study was well conducted, the overall quality of the evidence was only moderate for death and treatment failures because the study excluded children less than two months old, pregnant women, and the severely ill. The quality of evidence was lower for neurological disabilities because of the shortness of follow-up.
Since meningococcal disease has serious consequences, not giving antibiotics empirically would be unethical. However, future research comparing different antibiotics in people of all ages and illness severity is required to provide reliable evidence in different clinical settings.
This review did not find robust evidence that oral calcium supplementation reduces high blood pressure in adults. It reviewed 13 trials enrolling 485 people, which compared calcium supplementation with placebo or no treatment, and measured blood pressure 8 to 15 weeks later. On average, people receiving extra calcium achieved slightly lower systolic blood pressure at the end of trials. However, most trials were of poor quality, so their results may not be reliable. Trials were too small and short to measure whether extra calcium reduces the risk of death, heart attack or stroke. Calcium usually had no more adverse effects than placebo. Larger, longer duration, better quality trials are needed to clarify whether calcium supplementation can lower high blood pressure.
The included studies are not easily comparable because of differences in the treatment being studied, the dosage of these treatments, the length of study (and other differences in the study methods), and differences in the types of participants included for the research. The studies were generally well designed in order to reduce the possibility of bias, although for most studies the methods describing how participants were randomised were not described in detail. Otherwise, the risk of bias was low for most studies in the other categories. Serious side effects of treatment were uncommon, except for nerve damage in a long-term trial of dichloroacetate in adults.
One trial studied high-dose coenzyme Q10 treatment. This treatment had no clinical benefit. Three trials used creatine monohydrate: one trial reported improved muscle strength and biochemical measurements, but the other two trials reported no benefit (total of 38 participants). One trial studied the effects of a combination of coenzyme Q10, creatine monohydrate and lipoic acid, and reported a statistically significant improvement in biochemical measurements and ankle strength, but no clinical improvement (16 participants). Five trials studied the effects of dichloroacetate: three trials in children showed a statistically significant improvement in biochemical measurements but no clinical benefit on physiological measurements and exercise tests (total 63 participants); one trial of short-term therapy in adults demonstrated no clinical improvement in physiological measurements (total eight participants), and one longer-term trial in adults was terminated prematurely due to adverse effects without clinical benefit (using a combined scale of treatment effect, in 30 participants). One trial using dimethylglycine showed no significant effect on biochemical markers in five participants. One trial using a whey-based supplement demonstrated statistically significant improvement in biochemical markers but no clinical benefit in muscle strength or on health questionnaires (13 participants).
Further randomised controlled trials of high quality are needed. They should strictly address outcomes which are relevant to patient care and quality of life, and study these in particular subtypes of mitochondrial disease at a time. The current repertoire of nutritional supplements have been not shown to be effective and future trials should study new treatments.
The evidence is current up to April 2018. We included in this review 10 studies with 1015 adult participants. These studies were conducted in intensive care units and compared standard nutrition (the usual nutrition given to patients with ARDS) versus nutrition supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids or placebo (a substance with no active effect), and compared either with or without antioxidants. Antioxidants are molecules that can inhibit or slow down oxidation - a reaction that can cause inflammation and damage cells. It is unclear whether use of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants as part of nutritional intake in patients with ARDS improves long-term survival. It is uncertain whether omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants reduce length of ICU stay and the number of days spent on a ventilator, or if they improve oxygenation. It is also unclear if this type of nutrition causes increased harm. Findings of this review are limited by lack of standardization among the included studies in terms of methods, types of nutritional supplements given, and reporting of outcome measures. We rated the quality of evidence as low to very low.
Several non-randomised studies have reported differences in the psychological benefits, aesthetics and complication rates based on the timing of reconstruction. This review sought to compare the effects of the timing of reconstruction on morbidity and mortality, patient satisfaction and psychosocial well-being. Only one eligible randomised controlled trial (RCT) was found, which involved 64 women. However, because a substantial number of participants in the study chose not to undergo delayed reconstruction, it was not possible to make a fair comparison of the mixed group with those participants who underwent immediate reconstruction. Methodological flaws and a high risk of bias also diminished the quality of evidence found in the RCT. Since we have only identified one RCT in this area, an updated version of this review will evaluate other study designs specifically good quality cohort and case-control studies. Further research should aim to provide reliable evidence for people to make informed decisions as to the best and most appropriate timing of breast reconstruction following surgery for breast cancer.
We found only one study of 22 participants to include in the review. The participants had been selected for the study because they had been diagnosed clinically with DLB or AD. This method of recruiting participants tends to exaggerate the accuracy of a test. The participants in the study had moderately severe dementia when they had the DAT imaging. Overall, the DAT imaging correctly classified 100% of the participants who had DLB and 92% of the participants who did not have DLB at postmortem. When we looked at only the 15 participants whom the doctors thought had DLB at the start of the study, then the DAT imaging correctly classified 100% of the participants who had DLB and 100% of the participants who did not have DLB at postmortem. The small size of the included study meant that we could not be very confident in these estimates of accuracy, and it is still possible that the test is considerably less accurate than this would suggest. We can conclude that DAT imaging is a promising test for diagnosing DLB, but it is important to note that we did not find any studies of participants in whom diagnosis may be more difficult, such as those with only mild dementia or those who have only one symptom to raise a suspicion of DLB.
We wanted to find out if inhaled corticosteroids, compared to dummy treatment (placebo), given to premature infants from seven days of life could improve survival and reduce BPD. We also wanted to find out if inhaled corticosteroids produced unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared inhaled corticosteroids to placebo in premature infants who were at risk of BPD. We compared and summarised the results of the included studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We identified seven studies that had investigated this therapy in 218 premature infants. We do not know whether inhaled corticosteroids compared with placebo started from seven days of life reduces death or BPD in premature infants who are at risk of BPD. Nor do we know whether this treatment has any unwanted effects. More research is needed to investigate the potential benefits and harms of inhaled corticosteroids in this population. We are not confident in the evidence, because it is based on very few cases, and because very few studies reported our main outcome of death or BPD. The evidence is up to date to 29 August 2022.
In September 2016 we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving nasal decontamination for preventing SSI. We included two studies with 291 participants, all adults undergoing cardiac surgery. The anti-bacterial products used for cleaning the nose were mupirocin (antibiotic cream) and Anerdian (disinfectant solution). It is unclear whether nasal decontamination makes a difference to the rate of SSI in people carrying S aureus bacteria. S aureus SSI was reported in only one trial and the results do not allow us to be certain about differences in infection rates. Some participants in the Anerdian study reported side effects such as itching around the nose, but these were not serious. Mortality was low where reported (one death was directly related to S aureus infection). The two studies we found did not have many participants and the results were inconclusive. The Anerdian study report did not provide information about how the trial was conducted and this makes it difficult to be sure if it was at risk of bias. The mupirocin study was of better quality and at low risk of bias; but the small number of participants and limited effects affect the quality of the results. Evidence of the potential benefits and harms of using nasal decontamination for the prevention of SSI is currently of low to very low certainty. Larger, better-reported RCTs are needed to assess the clinical effectiveness of this treatment.
This plain language summary is up to date as of September 2016.
We identified 7 studies (991 participants) comparing the risks and benefits of urgent initiation of peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis using a catheter. We found that patients who underwent urgent PD may have a lower risk of blood-stream infection (presence of bacteria in the blood) compared with patients who underwent HD using a dialysis catheter. The differences in the risks of having other infectious complications and mechanical complications of a dialysis catheter, or sustainability on the original type of dialysis treatment (PD or HD) between the two modes of dialysis were uncertain. Patients on PD may have a lower risk of blood stream infection compared with those on HD using a catheter. However, it is unclear whether there are any differences in other infection-related or catheter-related complications, ability to remain on the same type of dialysis treatment, and patient survival between urgent PD and HD using a catheter.
This review included only one small trial with 60 women. There was not enough evidence to assess the effects of acupuncture for stress urinary incontinence compared with drug treatment, and high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed.
This review of four trials, which included 94 participants, found there is not enough evidence to decide if water-based exercises may reduce disability after stroke. There is a lack of hard evidence for water-based exercises after stroke. More research is therefore needed.
We searched up to July 2019 for all studies that assessed the use of MNP for improving the health and nutrition of children under two years of age. We included 29 studies that involved 33,147 infants and young children from low- and middle-income countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Twenty-six studies with 27,051 children contributed data. Of these 26 studies, 24 compared the use of MNP versus no intervention or placebo, and 2 compared the use of MNP versus an iron-only supplement (iron drops) given daily. We found that a variety of MNP formulations containing between 5 and 22 vitamins and minerals were given for 2 to 44 months to infants and young children aged 6 to 23 months. Most studies were funded by government programmes or foundations; only 2 were funded by industry. The use of MNP containing at least iron, zinc, and vitamin A for home fortification of foods was associated with reduced risk of anaemia of 18% and iron deficiency of 53% in children aged six months to two years compared with no intervention. Also, haemoglobin concentration and iron status improved. Studies did not find any effects on growth. There was no additional benefit in reducing risk of anaemia and improving haemoglobin concentration compared to usually recommended iron drops or syrups; however, only two studies compared these different interventions. No trials reported death attributable to the intervention. Information on deaths, side effects, and morbidity, including malaria and diarrhoea, was scarce. The use of MNP was beneficial for young children 6 to 23 months of age, independent of whether they lived in settings with different anaemia and malaria backgrounds and regardless of the length of the intervention.
MNP is better than no intervention or placebo and may be comparable to daily iron supplementation.The benefits of this intervention as a child survival strategy or for developmental outcomes are still unclear, and further investigation is required.
MNP intake adherence was variable and in some cases comparable to that achieved in infants and young children receiving standard iron supplements as drops or syrups. For the comparison of MNP versus no intervention or placebo, we judged the certainty of evidence to be moderate for anaemia and high for iron deficiency. The certainty of evidence for all other outcomes in this comparison was either low or moderate.
Two trials that compared the use of MNP versus iron supplement showed similar effects on anaemia and haemoglobin but less diarrhoea; however, we judged the certainty of evidence as low for anaemia and very low for haemoglobin concentration due to the small number of study participants.
This review included 61 trials (12,192 participants). Fifty-eight trials compared corticosteroids to no corticosteroids (placebo or usual care in 48 and nine trials, respectively); three trials also compared continuous versus bolus administration of corticosteroids. Three trials were funded by a drug company, 27 by public organizations or through charitable funding, and six by both a drug company and public organizations or charitable funding; 25 did not declare the source of funding. We have analysed the following two comparisons.
• Corticosteroids versus placebo/usual care.
Corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of death at 28 days by 9% (50 trials; 11,233 participants), with consistent treatment effects between children and adults. They also probably slightly reduce the risk of dying in hospital. There may be little or no effect of corticosteroids on risk of dying over the long term (longer than three months), but these results are less certain. Corticosteroids result in a large reduction in length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital. Corticosteroids increase the risk of muscle weakness and hypernatraemia. They probably increase the risk of hyperglycaemia. They probably do not increase the risk of superinfection. There may be little or no effect of corticosteroids on risk of gastroduodenal bleeding, neuropsychiatric events, stroke, or cardiac events.
• Continuous infusion versus intermittent boluses of corticosteroids.
We are uncertain about the effects of continuous infusion of corticosteroids compared with intermittent bolus administration. Three studies reported data for this comparison, and the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low. • Corticosteroids versus placebo/usual care
We judged the certainty of evidence for 28-day mortality as moderate due to some inconsistency related to differences among study populations, types of corticosteroids and how they were given, and use of additional interventions.
• Continuous infusion versus intermittent boluses of corticosteroids
We judged the certainty of evidence for 28-day mortality as very low due to inconsistency and imprecision.
We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate to low for the evidence of treatment failure, moderate for remission outcomes and low for seizure outcomes as it is likely that misclassification of seizure type influenced the results of the review. Within four of the five trials providing data for this review, the design of the trial meant that the people and treating clinicians knew which medication they were taking. This design may have influenced the results. Sodium valproate and phenytoin are commonly used treatments for individuals with epilepsy, but we found no difference between these treatments for the outcomes of this review or between seizure types. More information is needed and we recommend that all future trials comparing these medications, or any other antiepileptic medications, should be designed using high-quality methods. Seizure types of people included in trials should also be classified very carefully to ensure that the results are also of high quality.
It is not clear whether medication or surgery is the better treatment for OAG. The purpose of this review was to review and assess evidence from randomised studies to compare treatment with medications with surgical treatments in terms of how well they work, their relative safety and cost-effectiveness. Four relevant trials were identified, treating 888 people. Three studies were in the UK and one in the US. These trials had been initiated over many years from 1968 up to the most recent trial in 1993. The earlier trials used medications, and in one trial surgical techniques that are now rarely used. Findings of these studies suggest that, in mild OAG, worsening of the condition was not different whether first treatment was medication or surgery, but surgery was associated with more eye discomfort at five years. In more severe glaucoma, surgery lowered IOP significantly more than medications (not widely used anymore) and reduced the risk of progressive loss of visual field. In three trials the risk of developing cataract was higher with surgery (trabeculectomy), although in one trial with follow-up beyond five years there was no difference in the number of cataract surgeries between treatment groups. There was insufficient evidence to determine how well more recently available medications work compared with surgery in more severe OAG, and which was the more cost-effective treatment option. More research is required.
This review summarised data from all known comparative and observational studies lasting at least one month, and found no cases of fatal or nonfatal lactic acidosis in 70,490 patient-years of metformin use, or in 55,451 patient-years for those not on metformin. Average lactate levels measured during metformin treatment were no different than for placebo or for other medications used to treat diabetes. In summary, there is no evidence at present that metformin is associated with an increased risk for lactic acidosis when prescribed under the study conditions.
Eight studies met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review, and seven studies provided information for the review. The non-surgical treatment was chemoradiotherapy only in five studies and radiotherapy only in three studies. We included a total of 1114 participants undergoing non-surgical treatment (510 participants) or surgical treatment (604 participants) in the various analysis in the seven studies that provided information. Methods similar toÂ tossingÂ a coin were used to decide whether a participant received non-surgical treatment or surgical treatment and ensure that the participants in the two groups were similar. Most trials included people who were healthy in aspects other than the condition requiring surgery. The evidence is current up to 4th March 2016. Most information was from trials that compared chemoradiotherapy with surgery. There was no difference in long-term deaths between chemoradiotherapy and surgery in people with oesophageal cancer who are fit for surgery. More people died in radiotherapy than surgery in people with oesophageal cancer who are fit for surgery in the long-term. There was no difference in long-term cancer recurrence between non-surgical treatment and surgery. The difference between non-surgical and surgical treatments were imprecise for short-term deaths, the percentage of participants with serious adverse in three months, and the percentage of participants who had recurrence of cancer in and around the food-pipe. The health-related quality of life (covering aspects such as activity, daily living, health, support of family and friends, and outlook) was higher in non-surgical treatment between four weeks and three months after treatment, although it is unclear what this difference means to the patient. The difference between non-surgical and surgical treatments were imprecise for medium-term health-related quality of life (three months to two years after treatment). Chemoradiotherapy only appears to be at least equivalent to surgery in terms of short-term and long-term survival in people with one type of oesophageal cancer called squamous cell cancer and who are fit for surgery. There is more uncertainty in the comparison of chemoradiotherapy only versus surgery for another type of oesophageal cancer called adenocarcinoma, and we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of definitive chemoradiotherapy versus surgery in this type of oesophageal cancer. More people had difficulty in swallowing prior to their death after chemoradiotherapy treatment compared to surgical treatment.
Radiotherapy only results in less long-term survival than surgery (about 40% increase risk of deaths). Further well-designed studies that measure outcomes that are important for patients are necessary. The quality of evidence was low or very low because the included studies were small and had errors in study design. As a result, there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the results.
In 1995, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data looking at adding chemotherapy (drug treatment) to best supportive care. It gathered together information from all patients who took part in similar trials. These trials compared what happened to people with NSCLC who were given chemotherapy and best supportive care with those who only had best supportive care. We found that giving chemotherapy helped patients with advanced NSCLC to live longer.
Since this study was published, many new trials have been done. Therefore, we did a new systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data that included all trials, old and new. This study aimed to find out how much better chemotherapy as well as best supportive care was at helping patients to live longer. It also looked to see if new drugs were better or worse than older drugs, and if chemotherapy helps all types of patients.
We found that people with advanced NSCLC that had chemotherapy and best supportive care lived longer than those who had best supportive care. After 12 months, 29 out of every 100 who were given chemotherapy and best supportive care were alive compared to 20 out of every 100 who just had best supportive care.
Some patients and doctors may be concerned that the side effects of chemotherapy outweigh the benefits of receiving it. In this project we were unable to look at this in detail. However, three of the trials included in this project reported that for those patients who received chemotherapy, quality of life was either the same or better than those that did not receive chemotherapy.
This study showed that chemotherapy in addition to supportive care helped some patients to live longer, even the elderly and less fit.
The review was updated in 2012.
The review included three studies with 77 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 18 and 64 years of age. The studies looked at the impact of the timing of hypertonic saline inhalation in relation to airway clearance techniques. The studies reported immediate outcomes after inhalation of hypertonic saline before, during or after physical airway clearance techniques. All studies were short, involving only one to three treatments of each timing regimen. While outcomes such as lung function did not show any difference between the regimens, people with cystic fibrosis perceived that inhaling hypertonic saline before or during airway clearance techniques may be more effective and satisfying than inhaling hypertonic saline after airway clearance. No studies comparing morning and evening inhalation were found. The long-term efficacy of hypertonic saline has only been established for twice-daily inhalations; however, if only one dose per day is tolerated, the time of day at which it is inhaled could be based on convenience or tolerability until further evidence is available. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low. The only issues perhaps affecting the quality related to the fact that it was not possible for participants to be blinded to the treatment they received. However, because the studies were short-term and most of the significant results were based on perceived efficacy, timing of administration of hypertonic saline needs further study.
We searched the evidence in August 2016 and found a total of 125 studies involving 9469 women. Included studies investigated 49 different comparisons, which we split into three groups: intravenous fluid therapy, medications, and physical methods. Here we describe the results of the six main comparisons (crystalloid versus control; colloid versus crystalloid; ephedrine versus phenylephrine; ondansetron versus control; leg compression versus control; walking versus lying).
Fluid therapy (crystalloid versus control; colloid versus crystalloid)
It is uncertain whether crystalloids prevent hypotension because the quality of the evidence is very low. Giving colloids instead of crystalloids may mean that fewer women have low blood pressure after having spinal anaesthesia.
We cannot be certain due to the very low quality evidence whether crystalloid or colloid are better at preventing maternal low heart rate (bradycardia), high blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, neonatal acidosis, or low Apgar scores. Whether women received crystalloids or no fluids did not affect the number of women who experienced nausea and/or vomiting.
Medications (ephedrine versus phenylephrine; ondansetron versus control)
Lower rates of bradycardia occurred in women receiving ephedrine versus phenylephrine, and with ondansetron versus no ondansetron, but the evidence is low quality. Ondansetron may prevent low blood pressure and nausea/vomiting but made little or no difference to neonatal acidosis or Apgar scores. There was little difference between ephedrine and phenylephrine for low or high blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, neonatal acidosis, or Apgar scores. We cannot be certain of these results due to the low or very low quality of the evidence.
Physical methods (leg compression versus control; walking versus lying)
It is uncertain whether leg compression reduces the number of women with hypotension compared with no leg compression because the quality of evidence is very low. Similarly, we cannot be certain whether leg compression made any difference to women experiencing bradycardia or nausea and vomiting, or to babies' Apgar scores. It is also uncertain whether walking or lying down before the spinal anaesthesia reduces low blood pressure. We found that no single method completely prevents hypotension in women receiving spinal anaesthesia during caesarean birth. Administering intravenous fluids or certain medications, and compressing the legs with bandages, stockings, or inflatable devices may reduce the incidence of hypotension. However, we found the quality of the evidence to be low or very low, so there is still a need for large, high-quality studies using these clinically relevant interventions, either alone or in combination.
Future research in this setting could focus on combinations of these effective strategies or on new innovative strategies.
We searched for all relevant studies up to 24 February 2020.
We identified six clinical studies involving a total of 521 participants. All six studies compared drain use versus no drain use in individuals having an emergency open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. The included studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa. The age of the individuals in the trials ranged from 0 years to 82 years. The analyses were unable to show a difference in the number of individuals with intraperitoneal abscess or wound infection between drain use and no drain use. The overall complication rate and death rate were higher in the drainage group than in the no-drainage group. Hospital stay was longer (about two days) in the drain group than in the no-drain group. None of the included studies reported on costs, pain, or quality of life. All of the included studies had shortcomings in terms of methodological quality or reporting of outcomes. Overall, the certainty of the current evidence is judged to be low to very low. Overall, there is no evidence for any improvement in patient outcomes with the use of abdominal drainage in individuals undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. The increased risk of complication and hospital stay with drainage is based on low-certainty studies with small sample sizes. The increased risk of death with drainage comes from eight deaths observed in just under 400 people recruited to the studies. Larger studies are needed to more reliably determine the effects of drainage on complication and death outcomes.
We conducted a systematic search of the literature with no restrictions on language or country. We included in this review six studies, with a total population of 492 women with breast cancer. Five of the six studies had small samples. Study participants were predominantly 'white', well-educated women with moderate to high income at any stage of breast cancer who were undergoing a range of treatments.
Online support groups in these six trials lasted six to 30 weeks and included eight to 15 members. Women participated in these groups between 1.5 and 2.5 hours per week. Investigators reported all trials in English and conducted their research in the USA. None of the included trials measured emotional distress or uncertainty. Women who participated in online support groups showed no improvement in anxiety or quality of life when compared with those in control groups (which included women with similar characteristics who did not participate in online support groups). However, women who took part in online support groups showed a small to moderate reduction in depression when compared with those in control groups.
Results revealed no difference in depression between groups led by peers and those led by health professionals. However, women taking part in standard online groups (run by participants without prompting from health professionals) reported a greater reduction in depression and anxiety than those in other types of online groups (in which women were asked specifically by the health professional to respond to one another's need for support). Small studies of low or very low quality attributed mainly to poor study design and other shortcomings have provided evidence on the effectiveness of online support groups for women with breast cancer. Large, rigorous trials including ethnically and economically diverse participants are needed to provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of online support groups for women with breast cancer.
Authors working with Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review of existing studies, which includes evidence current up to 26 September 2011. This review includes three studies: two conducted in Europe and one in North America. All participants (114) were recruited in university clinics. One study compared intra-articular injections of sodium hyaluronate (a natural constituent of cartilage) with corticosteroids (betamethasone (an anti-inflammatory steroid)); the second study compared diclofenac sodium (a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug) with occlusal splint therapy; and the third study compared glucosamine sulfate or ibuprofen (a non-steroid anti-inflammatory). This review found weak evidence indicating that intra-articular injections of sodium hyaluronate and betamethasone had equivalent effectiveness in reducing pain and discomfort. Occlusal appliances when compared with diclofenac sodium showed a similar pain reduction, as did a comparison between the food supplement glucosamine and ibuprofen.
Future studies should aim to provide reliable information about which therapeutic modality is likely to be more effective for the reduction of pain and other symptoms (e.g. joint sounds) of TMJ OA. Moreover, because the limited evidence available only covers a restricted number of interventions, comparisons with other therapeutic modalities should be encouraged. One of the authors' concerns was the large number of trials which included mixed groups of participants diagnosed with TMJ OA, in addition to other disorders of the TMJ, which could not be considered in this review.
It is widely recommended that multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) should have a central process for assessing whether or not a patient has had an event, rather than relying solely on the outcomes reported by assessors at the relevant site where the decision might be subjective. These Adjudication Committees (ACs) are commonly used, especially in large trials. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) recommend assessment of events by such committees to harmonise and standardise outcome assessment across a trial. However, there is a need for evidence to justify the use of ACs and to decide on how central adjudication of clinical events should be conducted. This is the first large meta-analysis across medical areas to evaluate the impact of central adjudication on the estimates for treatment effect produced by RCTs. We investigated whether using the event data from ACs produced different treatment effect estimates than the data from onsite for subjective outcomes in RCTs.
We defined an AC as a committee of clinical experts in a specific medical area that seeks to harmonise and standardise the outcome assessment; whereas onsite assessors would be investigators, research nurses, data collectors, or patients themselves doing an onsite evaluation of the occurrence of the outcome during the RCT. Onsite assessors may, or may not, be blinded to the treatment assigned. We included all reports of RCTs and meta-analyses of published RCTs that reported the same subjective binary clinical event outcome assessed by both an onsite assessor and an AC.
We combined the findings of 47 RCTs (275,078 patients) in our systematic review and meta-analysis in order to see if there is a difference between the results from ACs and from onsite assessment. Our results showed that treatment effect estimates of subjective clinical events did not differ, on average, from those assessed by ACs. When we divided the data into whether or not the onsite assessors knew the patient's allocated treatment in the RCT and the various ways of submitting data to ACs, we found that there might be important differences between onsite assessment and ACs depending on which methods are used. Our findings, which are up to date as of August 2015, raise important uncertainty about whether ACs are being used appropriately across all RCTs.
We reviewed the benefits and harms of treating patients who have the form of the disease that affects the lungs with alpha-1 antitrypsin extracted from blood donations. We found three randomised clinical trials (283 participants in the analyses) comparing treatment with alpha-1 antitrypsin with placebo (a pretend treatment) for two to three years. All participants were ex-smokers or had never smoked but had the genetic problem that carried a high risk of developing lung problems. The evidence is current to March 2016. Only one trial reported deaths (one of 93 participants died taking the medicine and three of 87 died taking placebo). There was no information on harms in the oldest trial. In another trial, serious adverse events occurred in 10 participants in the medicine group and 18 participants in the placebo group. In the most recent trial, serious adverse events occurred in 28 participants in each group.
None of the trials reported on the number of lung infections or hospital admissions. There were more exacerbations (acute worsening in lung function) in the medicine group than in the placebo group, whereas quality of life was similar in the two groups.
All trials measured lung function using forced expiratory volume in one second (how much air a person can breathe out during a forced breath) and carbon monoxide diffusion (a medical test that measures how much gas travels from the lungs to the blood). Lung function was slightly worse in participants taking the medicine but the differences were not significant. Lung function deteriorated significantly less when measured by a special type of X-ray called a computer tomography (CT) scan. Several secondary outcomes were unreported in the largest and most recent trial whose authors had numerous financial conflicts of interest. Due to a lack of information, we cannot be sure whether this treatment works or not. Therefore, it is our opinion that treatment with alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation cannot be recommended.
There is a need to conduct a large, well-designed randomized trial that examines the efficacy of vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine for reducing GBS infection in term and preterm infants and overcomes the methodological limitations of the included studies. Costs associated with treatment with antibiotics and lack of skilled personnel have limited the availability of preventative treatment for women in poorer areas of the world. Chlorhexidine is inexpensive and has no impact on development of antibiotic resistance.
The number of participants in these three trials was small and is a limitation of this review. The quality of the included studies varied, which also limits confidence in the results. There have been no trials of this type undertaken in adults, and none of the trials commented on adverse events following immunisation, such as fever or injection site reactions.
We found 26 studies with 2272 participants receiving home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes compared with control. The content and delivery approach of the home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes were diverse among the included studies. The survivorship programme could incorporate any combination of at least two of the three identified components: educational (such as the provision of information and advice on how to self-manage); physical (such as exercise or resistance training); and psychological (such as counselling and cognitive therapies). Most of the studies used usual care (routine medical follow-up services) as a comparator. A few studies used a lower level or different type of intervention (e.g. stress management or exercise) or attention control as the comparator.
The results revealed that home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes in breast cancer survivors appear to have a short-term beneficial effect of improving quality of life. Several other studies examined the effects of home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes on symptoms and psychosocial outcomes. Those breast cancer survivors who received home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes showed a reduction in fatigue, insomnia and anxiety, but the effect was in the short term. There was no difference between groups with respect to symptoms of depression, flushes and night sweats. We found that a group-based approach may be more effective than an individual-based approach to deliver the home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes. However, we found no evidence for a difference in quality of life with educational, psychological or physical components of the survivorship programmes. The quality of evidence across studies for quality of life ranged from moderate to very low, meaning that in some cases we were fairly confident about the results (e.g. quality of life improvements) while in other cases we were uncertain about the results (e.g. reductions in fatigue, insomnia and anxiety).
This review was undertaken to determine the beneficial and harmful effects of vaccination against hepatitis B and of a reinforced recombinant vaccination series. None of the trials had high methodological quality. Plasma vaccine was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving hepatitis B antibodies. Yet no statistically significant difference was found between the use of plasma vaccine or placebo in preventing hepatitis B virus infections. No trials comparing recombinant vaccine with placebo were identified. There was no significant difference between recombinant and plasma vaccines or between a reinforced vaccination series and routine vaccinations of three inoculations using recombinant vaccine regarding achieving hepatitis B antibodies.
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. We assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. We found 11 studies that included 3374 children aged between five and 10 years at the start of the studies. Children were randomly assigned to treatment with either sealant or fluoride varnish, or both. They were followed for between one and nine years. Studies compared the number of children who had tooth decay in the dentine of their back teeth in different treatment groups.
The evidence was of very low certainty so we are not able to be confident in the findings.
When we combined four studies that compared resin sealants versus fluoride varnish, we found that neither intervention worked better than the other.
The three individual studies that compared sealants made from glass ionomer versus fluoride varnish could not be combined and had mixed results.
One small study found that using both sealants and fluoride varnish may work better than using fluoride varnish alone.
Five studies reported that no side effects were associated with the use of either sealants or fluoride varnishes. The other studies did not mention whether or not any side effects occurred. At present, we do not know whether it is better to apply sealants or fluoride varnish to prevent tooth decay in children's back teeth. We do know that both interventions are effective for reducing tooth decay, and current evidence does not suggest that one works better than the other.
Fourteen studies are currently underway. Their findings could improve the evidence in future versions of this review. The evidence is current to March 2020.
We included three studies from the 2013 review and an additional five new studies from the current review, for a total of eight studies with 450 participants (180 women). The number of participants in the included studies ranged between 17 and 131; the mean age of participants was between 63 and 71 years. Six studies explored the effects of combined aerobic and strengthening exercises; one explored the effects of combined aerobic exercise and inspiratory muscle training; and one explored the effects of combined aerobic exercise, strengthening exercise inspiratory muscle training and balance training. The length of the exercise programmes ranged from four to 20 weeks, with exercises performed twice to five days a week. Our results showed that people with NSCLC who exercised after lung surgery had better fitness level (measured using both a cycling test and the six-minute walk test) and strength in their leg muscles compared to those that did not exercise. We also showed initial evidence for better quality of life and less breathlessness in those who exercised. One adverse event (hip fracture) related to the intervention was reported in one study. The effect of exercise training after lung surgery on grip strength, fatigue, and lung function was uncertain. We found insufficient evidence for improvements in the strength of breathing muscles or feelings of anxiety and depression. Overall the quality (certainty) of evidence for the outcomes was moderate, ranging between very low (for breathlessness) and high (for fitness level measured via the six-minute walk test).
This review found 43 RCTs conducted up to July 2013 that included 4,084 participants with hot flushes who were close to the menopause or were menopausal. Evidence obtained is current to July 2013. Some trials reported a slight reduction in hot flushes and night sweats with phytoestrogen-based treatment. Extracts containing high levels of genistein (a substance derived from soy) appeared to reduce the number of daily hot flushes and need to be investigated further. Overall no indication suggested that other types of phytoestrogens work any better than no treatment. No evidence was found of harmful effects on the lining of the womb, stimulation of the vagina or other adverse effects with short-term use. Many of the trials in this review were small, of short duration and of poor quality, and the types of phytoestrogens used varied substantially.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The search is up-to-date as of the first of November 2019. We found 12 studies with a total of 1288 babies. Of these, 11 compared a single unit of light with or without reflective materials around the lights. One trial compared a single unit of light and reflective materials with two units of light without curtains. Types of reflective materials included white plastic, white linen, and aluminium draped on three or four sides of the baby's cot.
We found sufficient data on the primary outcome - decline in bilirubin - in 11 studies including 1132 babies: 10 for the first comparison and one for the second comparison.
Three studies reported a decline in bilirubin at four to eight hours. Moderate-certainty evidence shows a small but clinically important difference favouring the use of curtains. Decline in bilirubin over 24 hours was measured in nine studies. All studies showed a faster decline in bilirubin in the curtains group, but the decline varied so widely that it was not meaningful to estimate the size of the effect. Four studies reporting the duration of phototherapy showed that it was shorter when reflective curtains were used, but this is of very low certainty. Moderate-certainty evidence from two studies shows that the intervention reduces hospital stay by almost two days. There were no reports of any important adverse events, such as temperature instability or acute life-threatening events due to curtains obscuring the baby, nor of other minor effects. This means that overall reflective curtains might provide benefit, but we are uncertain about whether there are any harms. None of the studies reported parent or healthcare personnel satisfaction with the curtains, or whether the curtains had any effect on breastfeeding rates.
One trial compared use of one light unit with curtains to use of two light units without curtains and showed similar results for both intervention and control groups. Evidence is of moderate certainty.
We conducted the search on 5 August 2022, and identified 4682 citations (papers), out of which nine were eligible randomised controlled trials (a type of study where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). The studies included a total of 3269 participants from six countries, who were assigned to either Class I or III antiarrhythmics (or both) or placebo (sugar pill)/standard treatment. People taking part in the studies were on average 59 years old, and 71% were male. Most people had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (meaning they were not in atrial fibrillation all the time and alternated with normal rhythms). We found that the effect of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic drugs given up to around 3 months after ablation may reduce recurrence of arrhythmia at 0 to 3 months, and likely reduces recurrence at greater than 3 to 6 months, although the benefit does not appear to continue beyond 6 months (the evidence for this last result was very uncertain). We also looked at adverse outcomes (i.e. complications). We found that the use of antiarrhythmics was probably associated with a reduction in hospitalisation at 0 to 3 months. We also found evidence suggesting that antiarrhythmics are not associated with different rates of thromboembolic events (clots in the brain, lungs, or legs), heart attacks, death due to any cause, or requirement for repeat ablation compared with control or standard treatment. Our confidence in the evidence was low for recurrence of arrhythmias at 0 to 3 months, moderate at 3 to 6 months, and very low at greater than 6 months. Our confidence in the evidence for reduction of hospitalisation for arrhythmias was moderate.
This systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents identified 22 short-term (<= 16 weeks) randomised controlled trials which were eligible for inclusion (2519 participants). Treatment response was significantly greater after treatment with medication (58.1%) than with placebo (31.5%) in 14 trials. Medication was more effective than placebo in reducing overall symptom severity across all of the anxiety disorders (number of studies (N) = 9). The greatest number of trials were for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), for which treatment efficacy in reducing symptom severity was also observed . The greatest number of trials showing efficacy to date have used the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). No controlled evidence could be found for the effectiveness of benzodiazepines, despite their continued prescription for paediatric anxiety disorders. Medication was less well tolerated than placebo, as indicated by the significant proportion of children and adolescents who dropped out due to adverse effects during the short term trials. Furthermore, while few incidences of suicidal behaviour/ideation in the included trials were attributed to study medication, it is important to be aware of the need for careful monitoring after initiation of SSRIs in treating this population. In conclusion, medication should be considered as part of the treatment of paediatric anxiety disorders over the short-term. Additional research into the optimal dose and duration of medication treatment, as well as the effects of age on the efficacy and tolerability of medication is warranted.
This review analyzed the effects of furosemide on preterm babies receiving indomethacin to close the ductus arteriosus. The review of trials found not enough evidence to recommend routine use of furosemide in preterm infants who receive indomethacin for closing a ductus arteriosus.
We wanted to find out whether add-on medications to prevent weight gain caused by antipsychotics were effective in people with schizophrenia. We searched for studies that examined any medicine given alongside antipsychotics to prevent weight gain in people with schizophrenia. Study participants could be any age or sex but had to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness. They had to be chosen at random to receive either the weight-prevention medicine, or a placebo (a dummy medicine) or no add-on medicine (standard treatment).
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 17 studies with 1388 people that examined the effects of add-on medications to prevent weight gain caused by antipsychotics. The add-on medications were metformin, topiramate, H2 antagonists, monoamine modulators, monoamine modulators plus betahistine, melatonin, and samidorphan. Studies were short, lasting between 6 and 24 weeks. And they were small, with only 63 people on average - the smallest included only 14 people, the largest 561 people.
Studies done to date suggest that:
- metformin may be effective in preventing weight gain and is well-tolerated compared to standard treatment (5 studies, 232 participants);
- H2 antagonists, such as nizatidine, famotidine and ranitidine, or monoamine modulators, such as reboxetine and fluoxetine may be potentially effective in preventing weight gain caused by antipsychotics;
- topiramate is probably not effective in preventing weight gain caused by antipsychotics. Our confidence in the evidence is limited because we found only a small number of studies for each add-on medication. Studies included few people, and lasted only a short time. The evidence is up to date to February 2021.
We searched for evidence in October 2019, and included 17 randomised controlled studies, involving 1132 women, published between 1967 and 1997. All women had perineal pain following an episiotomy (usually within 48 hours after birth), and were not breastfeeding. The women received either aspirin (doses ranging from 300 mg to 1200 mg) or fake pills (placebo), by mouth. The methodological quality of the studies was often unclear. Two studies did not contribute any data for analyses.
Aspirin compared with placebo may increase adequate pain relief for mothers four to eight hours after administration (low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief, or on adverse effects for mothers, in the four to eight hours after administration (both very low-certainty evidence).
The effects of administering 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 study), 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 studies), or 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 study) are uncertain for adequate pain relief, the need for additional pain relief, or adverse effects for the mother.
No studies reported on adverse effects of aspirin for the baby, or other outcomes we planned to assess: prolonged hospital stay, or readmission to hospital due to perineal pain; perineal pain six weeks after childbirth, women's views, or postpartum depression. A single dose of aspirin may help with perineal pain following episiotomy for women who are not breastfeeding, when measured four to eight hours after administration.
We found no information to assess the effects of aspirin for women who are breastfeeding.
The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 28 February 2013. Twelve studies with a combined total of 689 participants were included in this review. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 68 years and most participants (90%) were male. All of the studies compared different types of surgical treatments, and each study evaluated a different aspect of surgical treatment such as different types of plates, screws, or wires or how long the jaw was immobilized after surgery. There were concerns about the design and quality of all the studies. All the studies evaluated different aspects of surgical treatment. None of the studies evaluated non-surgical treatments such as intermaxillary fixation and no study compared surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment. As a result there is no clear evidence to indicate which approach is the best to manage these fractures. The quality of the evidence found is poor. Recommendations are made for further well-conducted research studies in this area to be undertaken.
While we found two completed trials, both were published only in conference abstracts that failed to provide any usable data. We also found two ongoing trials. In all, the review found no evidence from randomised trials to inform on the best ways to treat these fractures.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) use the play of chance to allocate participants to comparison groups to prevent selection bias. Other means of treatment allocation are more prone to bias because decisions about which treatment to use can be influenced by the preferences of the physician or patient. This review compares random allocation (allocated to treatment using a random method) versus non-random allocation (allocated to treatment using a non-random method, such as alternation or external, uncontrollable factors, with no clinical judgement involved) and controlled trials with adequate versus inadequate/unclear concealment of allocation. Concealed treatment allocation is best described in general terms as the process used to prevent foreknowledge of group assignment in a controlled trial (such as the use of sequentially numbered opaque, sealed envelopes).
The results of randomised and non-randomised studies sometimes differed. Sometimes non-randomised studies yielded larger estimates of effect, and sometimes randomised trials yielded larger estimates of effect. On the other hand, not using concealed random allocation resulted in larger estimates of effect, but sometimes it resulted in similar estimates of effect (from harmful to beneficial or vice versa). It is a paradox that the unpredictability of random allocation is the best protection against the unpredictability of the extent to which non-randomised studies may be biased.
We found 10 studies conducted with a total of 955 employees with musculoskeletal complaints from high-income countries. Four studies evaluated changes to the physical work environment through provision of sit-stand or treadmill workstations, two studies evaluated individual approaches involving use of an activity tracker, and five studies used multi-component interventions and counselling interventions. However, no studies solely targeted interventions at the organisation level. The available evidence is insufficient to show the effectiveness of sit-stand desk or treadmill workstations in reducing the intensity of low back and upper back symptoms. The effectiveness of an activity tracker compared to an alternative intervention or no intervention in reducing the intensity or presence of low back, upper back, neck, shoulder, and elbow/wrist and hand symptoms cannot be determined based on available evidence at short-term follow-up (less than six months). No available studies have examined the effectiveness of interventions targeted solely at the organisational level. Available evidence is insufficient to show the effectiveness of combining multiple interventions in reducing the proportions of people with low back or upper back pain at short-term follow-up (less than six months), medium-term follow-up (between six and 12 months), or long-term follow-up (12 months or longer). The review did not find conclusively that interventions to increase standing or walking are effective in reducing the intensity or presence of musculoskeletal symptoms among sedentary workers in the short, medium, or long term. This may be due in part to the quality of the evidence, which is low or very low largely due to study design and small sample sizes. Some interventions that targeted changes to the work environment such as the use of sit-stand desks are suggestive of an improvement in musculoskeletal symptoms. Therefore, additional studies of larger scale and longer duration that recruit people with baseline musculoskeletal symptoms are needed to determine whether interventions to increase standing or walking can reduce musculoskeletal symptoms among sedentary workers, and whether these changes can be maintained.
We found six trials that used zinc to treat leg ulcers but all were too small to show a benefit, even if one exists. Furthermore the methods used in the existing trials mean that their results were possibly biased. On the basis of the evidence we have so far it appears that taking zinc tablets does not improve leg ulcer healing, however better quality trials are needed.
Cochrane authors included in this review 33 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating 3332 surgeries to compare traditional native tissue anterior repair versus biological grafts (eight trials), absorbable mesh (three trials), permanent (polypropylene) mesh (16 trials) and abdominal paravaginal repair (two trials). Four trials compared a transvaginal graft versus another transvaginal graft, and four trials evaluated native tissue repair of anterior and/or posterior compartments of the vagina versus graft repair. Evidence is current to 23 August 2016. Biological graft repair or absorbable mesh provides minimal advantage compared with native tissue repair. Results showed no evidence of differences between biological graft and native tissue repair in rates of awareness of prolapse or repeat surgery for prolapse. However, the recurrent anterior prolapse rate was higher after native tissue repair than after any biological graft. This suggests that if awareness of prolapse after biological graft occurs in 12% of women, 7% to 23% would be aware of prolapse after native tissue repair.
Permanent mesh resulted in lower rates of awareness of prolapse, recurrent anterior wall prolapse and repeat surgery for prolapse compared with native tissue repair. However, native tissue repair was associated with reduced risk of new stress urinary incontinence. Other benefits of native tissue repair included reduced bladder injury and reduced rates of repeat surgery for prolapse, stress urinary incontinence and mesh exposure (as a combined outcome). The quality of the data related to traditional native tissue anterior repair compared with both biological grafts and permanent mesh is generally low to moderate. The main limitations were incomplete reporting of study methods including allocation concealment and bias and imprecision in data outcomes. Data related to the efficacy of absorbable mesh are probably incomplete.
We analysed 53 qualitative studies where patients received rehabilitation services in their own homes. In some of the studies, healthcare providers delivered the services in person. In the other studies, providers delivered the services through telerehabilitation using digital technologies. The studies explored the views and experiences of patients, families and healthcare providers. Most of the studies were from high-income countries.
Our findings highlight several factors that can influence the organisation and delivery of home-based rehabilitation. We have moderate to high confidence in the following findings.
Home-based rehabilitation services delivered in-person or through telerehabilitation
Patients experience home-based services as convenient and less disruptive of their everyday activities. Patients and providers also suggest that these services can encourage patients' self-management and can make them feel empowered about the rehabilitation process. But patients, family members, and providers describe privacy and confidentiality issues when services are provided at home. These include the increased privacy of being able to exercise at home but also the loss of privacy when one’s home life is visible to others.
Patients and providers also describe other factors that can affect the success of home-based rehabilitation services. These include support from providers and family members, good communication with providers, the requirements made of patients and their surroundings, and the transition from hospital to home-based services.
Telerehabilitation specifically
Patients, family members and providers see telerehabilitation as an opportunity to make services more available. But providers point to practical problems when assessing whether patients are performing their exercises correctly. Providers and patients also describe interruptions from family members.
In addition, providers complain of a lack of equipment, infrastructure and maintenance and patients refer to usability issues and frustration with digital technology. Providers have different opinions about whether telerehabilitation is cost-efficient for them. But many patients see telerehabilitation as affordable and cost-saving if the equipment and infrastructure has been provided.
Patients and providers suggest that telerehabilitation can change the nature of their relationship. For instance, some patients describe how telerehabilitation leads to easier and more relaxed communication. Other patients describe feeling abandoned when receiving telerehabilitation services.
Patients, family members and providers call for easy-to-use technologies and more training and support. They also suggest that at least some in-person sessions with the provider are necessary. They feel that telerehabilitation services alone can make it difficult to make meaningful connections. They also explain that some services need the provider’s hands. Providers highlight the importance of personalising the services to each person’s needs and circumstances. We searched for studies that had been published up to 16 June 2022.
We searched for trials that compared usual care with intensive insulin treatment (trying to keep blood sugar levels within the normal range of 4 to 7.5 mmol/L) after stroke. We found 11 trials involving 1583 participants. Trying to keep the blood sugar level within a tight range immediately after a stroke did not improve the outcomes of neurological deficit and dependency. It did, however, significantly increase the chance of experiencing very low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which can be harmful and can cause brain damage and death. On balance, the trials did not show any benefit from intensive control of blood sugar levels after stroke.
We searched various sources up to 29 August 2017 and included 13 studies that involved 67,688 people with atrial fibrillation who received either a factor Xa inhibitor or a vitamin K antagonist. All included people were adults and on average aged between 65 and 74 years. Approximately one-third were women. We found that factor Xa inhibitors when compared with warfarin, which was used as comparator in all trials, reduced the number of strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. This reduction was, however, rather small. Factor Xa inhibitors also appeared to reduce the number of serious bleedings (including those into the brain) and the number of people dying from any cause compared with warfarin. We considered the quality of evidence in our review as moderate to high. The studies that we included were generally large to very large. We found that the results from the larger studies were generally similar and this strengthened our findings. Finally, we are confident that we included all relevant studies in our review and did not miss any important studies.
Scientists have wondered if injections of this could reduce the damage done to someone when they are infected with tuberculosis, and some early trials suggested this might be true. However, this overview involving eight trials identified that the research does not show any consistent effect of this injection on death or the course of tuberculosis illness. It may be that the early trials had methodological problems that led to false optimism about this intervention.
We studied whether a difference could be seen in the growth of children with persistent asthma who were using different doses of the same ICS molecule and the same delivery device. We found 22 eligible trials, but only 10 of them measured growth or other measures of interest. Overall, 3394 children included in the review combined 17 group comparisons (i.e. 17 pairs of groups of children with mild to moderate asthma using a particular dose and type of steroid in 10 trials). Trials used different ICS molecules (beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone or mometasone) either on their own or in combination with a long-acting beta2-agonist (a drug used to open up the airways) and generally compared low doses of corticosteroids (50 to 100 μg) with low to medium (200 μg) doses of corticosteroids (converted in μg HFA-beclomethasone equivalent) over 12 to 52 weeks. We found a small but statistically significant group difference in growth over 12 months between these different doses clearly favouring the lower dose of ICS. The type of corticosteroid among newer molecules (ciclesonide, fluticasone, mometasone) did not seem to influence the impact on growth over one year. Differences in corticosteroid doses did not seem to affect the change in height, the gain in weight, the gain in body mass index and the maturation of bones. This review is based on a small number of trials that reported data and were conducted on children with mild to moderate asthma. Only 10 of 22 studies measured the few outcomes of interest for this review, and only four comparisons reported growth over 12 months. Our confidence in the quality of evidence is high for this outcome, however it is low to moderate for several other outcomes, depending on the number of trials reporting these outcomes. Moreover, a few outcomes were reported only by a single trial; as these findings have not been confirmed by other trials, we downgraded the evidence for these outcomes to low quality. An insufficient number of trials have compared the effect of a larger difference in dose, for example, between a high dose and a low dose of ICS and of other popular molecules such as budesonide and beclomethasone over a year or longer of treatment. We report an ICS dose–dependent reduction in growth velocity in prepubescent school-aged children with mild to moderate persistent asthma. The choice of ICS molecule (mometasone, ciclesonide or fluticasone) was not found to affect the level of growth velocity response over a year. The effect of corticosteroids on growth was not consistently reported: among 22 eligible trials, only four comparisons reported the effects of corticosteroids on growth over one year. In view of parents' and clinicians' concerns, lack of or incomplete reporting of growth is a matter of concern given the importance of the topic. We recommend that growth be systematically reported in all trials involving children taking ICS for three months or longer. Until further data comparing low versus high ICS dose and trials of longer duration are available, we recommend that the minimal effective ICS dose be used in all children with asthma.
Searches of all relevant sources of medical information identified 7558 articles, and, after initial screening of all these articles, we selected 45 as being suitable for this review. On reading the summaries of these 45 trials, 10 were suitable to be included in this review. We included trials that looked at the effects of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over having radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic cancer. We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease. Results showed that studies evaluating dietary changes, including changes in dietary fat, fibre and lactose, during radiotherapy reduced diarrhoea at the end of treatment. However, these dietary changes did not seem to improve patients' weights. While some changes to diet during radiotherapy may benefit patients by reducing diarrhoea, it is important to recognise that some of the studies reviewed were dated and there have been changes in radiotherapy technique since then that may give patients less diarrhoea anyway. In addition, many studies were of poor quality and, therefore, only a small number were able to be included in this review. Some interventions described, for example, having to take a liquid diet, were not acceptable as many patients found them difficult to tolerate and were unable to take them completely.
Does deep muscle relaxation during laparoscopic surgery improve patients' outcomes? We searched for studies that compared deep muscle relaxation to one of the following levels of more superficial muscle relaxation:
– no muscle relaxation;
– shallow muscle relaxation;
– moderate muscle relaxation. We found 42 studies that involved 3898 people who underwent any type of laparoscopic surgery in the abdomen. In most cases, these were surgeries to the gut or stomach (20 studies). The studies were conducted across the world. Most studies compared deep muscle relaxation to moderate muscle relaxation (38 studies). Follow-up of complications and mortality ranged from three days to 60 days after surgery. Pharmaceutical companies or for-profit organisations funded 22 of the studies. Mortality and serious unwanted effects almost did not occur in the comparison of deep muscle relaxation and moderate muscle relaxation. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether deep muscle relaxation reduces any of those outcomes. There are probably no differences in health-related quality of life shortly after surgery and in duration of surgery. It is uncertain whether deep muscle relaxation changes pain scores after surgery, duration of hospital stay, or number of readmissions.
We found too few studies for the comparison of deep muscle relaxation to shallow muscle relaxation and no muscle relaxation to draw conclusions. For most outcomes, our confidence in the evidence is limited. This is due to the low number of unwanted effects reported and concerns about how some of the studies were conducted. The evidence is up to date to 31 July 2023.
Evidence is current to May 2014. We included seven studies with 492 participants from five different countries and included 422 participants in our analysis. Most participants were middle-aged. Participants had almost no diseases other than their reason for having surgery. The type of surgery was planned abdominal surgery. Three of the seven studies looked only at obesity surgery. Participants received dexmedetomidine right before or during their abdominal surgery. Six studies compared dexmedetomidine with no treatment, and one small study compared dexmedetomidine with fentanyl (a strong opioid).
We reran the search in May 2015 and found nine studies of interest, which we will discuss when we update the review. In total, 13 studies are awaiting classification. Most of the studies that compared dexmedetomidine with no treatment found that dexmedetomidine reduced the need for opioids for treating pain for 24 hours after surgery. During the same period, no important differences in pain were noted, except one study (80 participants) showed a reduction in intensity of pain at two hours after surgery with dexmedetomidine. The quality of the evidence was very low because the results were not similar across studies, and because some studies were poorly conducted. The influence of dexmedetomidine on postoperative nausea and vomiting could not be determined because results were not similar across studies. No conclusion could be made for bowel function and mobilization and side effects such as postoperative sedation, as data were insufficient. One study with 80 participants reported a higher rate of low blood pressure ('low' meaning that medication was required) for participants receiving a high dose of dexmedetomidine compared with no treatment, but for lower doses of dexmedetomidine, they noted no differences compared with no treatment.
For the comparison dexmedetomidine versus fentanyl, data were insufficient to allow conclusions (only one small study). Dexmedetomidine - compared with no treatment - seemed to reduce the need for opioids without worsening the experience of postoperative pain after abdominal surgery in adults. However, the quality of evidence was very low because studies were poorly conducted and because results were not similar across studies. The importance of these findings for patients was also uncertain because the influence of dexmedetomidine on bowel function, mobilization and adverse effects could not be properly determined.The seven included studies were small, so side effects associated with use of dexmedetomidine may be greater than this review reported. In addition, we could not obtain relevant data from several studies because investigators mixed abdominal surgery with other types of surgery.
We wanted to determine if calcium and vitamin D were able to increase the mineral content of bones and reduce the risk of fractures, and to report potential side effects of supplementation. We searched medical databases for well-designed clinical studies of calcium and vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination compared with placebo (dummy treatment) in healthy women aged 18 to 45 years (premenopausal). We analysed three combinations: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo, administered for at least three months. We looked at their effects on increasing minerals in the bones of the hip and spine, if the women had vertebral (backbone) or any other fractures during the study, effects on quality of life, and if these women had to stop the supplementation because of side effects. We included seven studies with 941 healthy premenopausal women with an average age per study of 18 to 42.1 years. The women were randomly assigned to receive supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin D plus calcium, or placebo. There was no difference in bone mineral density in any of the groups being supplemented with calcium, vitamin D, or calcium plus vitamin D compared with placebo. The studies did not report fractures (from any anatomical site), quality of life, or stopping the supplementation for side effects. The common limitations in the methods of the studies included small numbers of participants, studies, and data; problems in adherence to treatment, participants may have known which treatment they received; and lack of information for withdrawals from treatment. The funding for the studies was provided by institutional, academic, government, and pharmaceutical industries. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.
Six multicentre, well designed pre-market studies including 5640 participants were eligible for this review. Pooling analysis did not performed in four trials due to the data not similar enough, but conducted for two trials. Topotecan appears to have a similar level of effectiveness as paclitaxel, topotecan plus thalidomide, and superior than treosulfan, but shorter overall survival than pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Topotecan delays progression of disease than paclitaxel, treosulfan; topotecan plus thalidomide superior than topotecan alone on PFS, but topotecan alone significantly shorter than topotecan plus thalidomide. Further consolidation treatment with topotecan does not improve PFS for participants with advanced ovarian cancer who respond to initial chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
Evidence from three studies were high quality, the remaining studies were low or moderate due to poor reporting of the methodology. For gaining the better representativeness, more large, well-designed randomised controlled trials of post-market drug are required in the future.
The evidence is current to 14 November 2018. We included 11 trials with 559 participants in the review, and seven trials with 249 participants in the analysis. The trials were funded by departmental resources (five trials), or in part by industry and partly by charity (one trial). Five trials did not mention the source of funding. Three of the trials included in the analysis contained some participants older than 18 years. There may be a small additional reduction in pain up to 72 hours after surgery with epidural analgesia compared with systemic analgesia. After an extensive spine surgery, the gut is paralysed for a certain amount of time leading to nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick), inability to ingest liquid or food, and no stools excretion. Two very small studies showed epidural analgesia with local anaesthetic alone may have accelerated the return of gut function. If confirmed, this would mean that children would be able to resume normal liquid and solid food intake faster after extensive spine surgery. Children in two small studies were more satisfied with epidural analgesia compared with children in the systemic analgesia group. However, it was unclear whether their parents were more satisfied with epidural analgesia or systemic analgesia. The safety of this technique in children undergoing spine surgery was uncertain because there was insufficient information to determine whether there was a difference in the rate of complications between epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia and an analysis of small trials might not be the best methodology to evaluate this aspect. The quality of evidence was moderate, low or very low for reduced pain and low or very low for all other measurements.
Imperfections in the trials and low number of available trials were the main problems leading to rating the quality of evidence as low or very low.
We found 332 studies that met our criteria and 319 of these provided information that we could use in our analyses. These included 157,179 adults who smoked tobacco cigarettes. Most of the studies took place in the USA or Europe. The studies compared the effects of the stop smoking treatments listed above with:
- no medicine/e-cigarettes for stopping smoking;
- e-cigarettes that did not contain nicotine;
- placebo (a dummy medication); and
- other types of stop smoking medicine or e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes, varenicline and cytisine were most likely to help people quit smoking. For every 100 people, 10 to 19 are likely to quit using an e-cigarette; 12 to 16 using varenicline; and 10 to 18 using cytisine. This is compared to the 6 in 100 people likely to quit when using no medicine/e-cigarette or placebo. People using two forms of nicotine replacement therapy at the same time, for example, a combination of nicotine patch and nicotine gum, seemed to have similar rates of quitting to people using e-cigarettes, varenicline and cytisine. Nicotine patches alone, another form of nicotine replacement therapy alone (such as gum, lozenge) and bupropion appeared to help fewer people quit but still work better than no medicine/e-cigarette or placebo (8, 9 and 9 people per 100, respectively). Nortriptyline appeared to result in the lowest number of people quitting smoking; for every 100 people using nortriptyline 6 to 11 are likely to quit.
We are moderately confident that bupropion could rarely cause some serious health effects. The information we have for other treatments does not provide clear evidence of serious harms. For all treatments, findings suggest very few people experience serious harms when using them. We are confident that e-cigarettes, cytisine, varenicline, nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion help people stop smoking. We do not expect more evidence will change these results. However, more evidence on how these treatments compare to one another, particularly in relation to harms, would be useful. Due to the nature of our analyses we were not able to judge our confidence in the evidence for combination nicotine replacement therapy (two types used together). We are moderately confident that nortriptyline also helps people to stop smoking, but are less confident in our results for non-nicotine e-cigarettes and for potential harms of most of the treatments. We still need more evidence on potential harms and hope more studies will report on these in future; however, nicotine replacement therapy has been used since the 1980s with no evidence of serious harms.
Three trials (N = 1421) were included in the meta-analysis assessing the efficacy of chemotherapy plus rituximab compared to chemotherapy without further therapy. The meta-analysis showed for patients receiving additional rituximab a statistically significant improvement of overall survival and a longer time without progression of the disease. Treatment with rituximab caused more adverse events, but this did not lead to a statistically significant difference regarding death caused by treatment. However, patients who were treated within these trials did not suffer from other severe health problems aside from CLL; therefore, it remains unclear whether patients with severe co-morbidities will benefit from this treatment option.
In summary, this meta-analysis showed that patients receiving chemotherapy plus rituximab benefited in terms of survival compared to those with chemotherapy alone. Therefore, it supports the recommendation of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide as an option for the first-line treatment as well as for people with relapsed or refractory CLL. Further research should focus on the evaluation of benefits of adding rituximab to other chemotherapy regimens than fludarabine with cyclophosphamide in the therapy of previously untreated, relapsed or refractory patients. It should also assess whether patients with serious co-morbidities will benefit from the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy.
The available evidence regarding assessed comparisons from four other trials was not sufficient to deduct final conclusions.Two trials evaluated polychemotherapy in combination with rituximab versus alemtuzumab respectively. One trial evaluated two different rituximab schedules: rituximab given concurrently with primary treatment plus rituximab therapy given subsequently to the primary treatment versus primary treatment alone with subsequent administration of rituximab. One trial investigated two different dosages (500 mg and 1000 mg) of ofatumumab in addition to fludarabine with cyclophosphamide.
Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are needed to determine the clinical effects of novel anti-CD20 antibodies, such as ofatumumab or GA101, compared to rituximab. We are aware of 16 ongoing studies, including three trials comparing ofatumumab with or without additional chemotherapy versus no treatment. The findings of these trials will be included in an update of this review and could lead to different conclusions and may allow a judgement on general efficacy and safety of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody in the treatment of CLL.
This review update (up to 26 August 2016) includes two clinical trials that compared antibiotics with placebo for children in the post-acute bronchiolitis phase (> 14 days). The first was reported from Turkey and enrolled 30 infants aged seven months or younger. The second was reported from Australia and New Zealand and enrolled 249 infants aged 24 months or younger. Both trials initiated treatment during hospitalisation for bronchiolitis and provided follow-up for six months post hospitalisation. This review update includes a total of two trials with 249 children (n = 240 completed). Both studies contributed to primary and secondary outcomes, but the quality of evidence was low. Review authors noted no significant differences between treatment groups for our primary outcomes: proportion of children (n = 249) who had persistent symptoms at follow-up, and number of children (n = 240) rehospitalised with respiratory illness within six months; nor for our secondary outcome: proportion of children (n = 240) with wheeze at six months. One study reported bacterial resistance, but only at 48 hours. One study reported adverse events from which all children recovered and remained in the study. Currently, not enough evidence is available to inform whether antibiotics should be used to treat or prevent persistent respiratory symptoms in the post-acute phase of bronchiolitis. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics for reducing persistent respiratory symptoms, especially in countries where morbidity of bronchiolitis is high (e.g. indigenous populations).
Thirty-five RCTs covering 2861 patients were included in this systematic review. There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendations about acupuncture or dry-needling for acute low-back pain. For chronic low-back pain, results show that acupuncture is more effective for pain relief than no treatment or sham treatment, in measurements taken up to three months. The results also show that for chronic low-back pain, acupuncture is more effective for improving function than no treatment, in the short-term. Acupuncture is not more effective than other conventional and "alternative" treatments. When acupuncture is added to other conventional therapies, it relieves pain and improves function better than the conventional therapies alone. However, effects are only small. Dry-needling appears to be a useful adjunct to other therapies for chronic low-back pain.
The review authors included five randomised and one controlled clinical trial involving a total of nearly 450 patients. In general the quality of the studies was good. Amputation after 12 months was required less often when SCS was added to standard care. Significant pain relief occurred with and without SCS but patients in the SCS group required fewer pain killers. Overall there was no difference on ulcer healing rates between the two treatment groups. Complications of SCS treatment consisted of problems with initially implanting the electrodes, in 8% of patients, and the need for repeat surgery because of electrode or lead failures in 12% of patients; infections occurred less frequently (3%). The average overall costs at two years were calculated in one study and found to be EUR 36,500 in the SCS group and EUR 28,600 in the conservative treatment alone group.
For the present review, researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effects of topiramate in adult patients (≥ 16 years of age) with 'episodic' migraine (headache on < 15 days per month). They examined research published up to 15 January 2013 and found 17 relevant studies. Compared with placebo, topiramate reduced the frequency of migraine headaches by approximately 1.2 per month (nine studies, 1737 participants). Patients were also about twice as likely to reduce the number of their migraine headaches by 50% or more with topiramate than with placebo (nine studies, 1190 participants). Side effects associated with topiramate were common but generally mild; topiramate can, however, cause birth defects and so should be used with caution in women of childbearing age. Further research is needed comparing topiramate with other active drugs used for preventing migraine attacks.
We searched for available research up to January 2016 and found 260 studies with different designs. We included a number of non-randomised designs (where investigators did not assign participants to a certain treatment):
– 7 comparative cohort studies (a group of people followed over time; six studies compared 968 patients who were taking methylphenidate to 166 controls who were not taking methylphenidate; and 1 study included 1224 patients that were taking or not taking methylphenidate during different time periods);
– 4 patient-control studies (comparing two groups of people: 53,192 were taking methylphenidate, and 19,906 were not);
– 177 non-comparative cohort studies (2,207,751 participants) with no control group (i.e. who were not taking methylphenidate);
– 2 cross-sectional studies (96 participants were taking methylphenidate at a single time point); and
– 70 patient reports/series (206 participants were taking methylphenidate).
We also included methylphenidate groups from randomised clinical trials (RCTs; experiments in which participants are randomly put into independent groups that compare different treatments). All RCTs assessed methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD and follow-up periods from RCTs. We only used the data from the intervention arm with methylphenidate. In all the included non-comparative cohort studies, 2,207,751 participants were taking methylphenidate. Participants' ages ranged from 3 years to 20 years. The findings suggest that methylphenidate administration might lead to serious adverse (harmful) events, including death, cardiac problems, and psychotic disorders. About 1 in 100 patients treated with methylphenidate seemed to suffer a serious adverse event. Withdrawal from methylphenidate due to serious adverse events occurred in about 1.2 out of 100 patients treated with methylphenidate. Withdrawal from methylphenidate due to any adverse events occurred in about 7.3 out of 100 patients treated with methylphenidate. We also noted a large proportion of non-serious adverse events. More than half the patients exposed to methylphenidate seemed to suffer one or more adverse events. Withdrawal from methylphenidate due to non-serious adverse events occurred in about 6.2 out of 100 patients exposed to methylphenidate. Withdrawal of methylphenidate for unknown reasons was 16.2 out of 100 patients exposed to methylphenidate. The quality of the evidence and hence the certainty or reliability of the evidence for the comparative studies is very low. The reliability of the evidence for the non-comparative studies is low due to weaknesses in study design. Accordingly, it is not possible to accurately estimate the risks of adverse events in children and adolescents prescribed methylphenidate. Methyphenidiate might be associated with a number of serious adverse events. Methylphenidate produces a large number of other non-serious harmful effects in children and adolescents with ADHD. We suggest that clinicians and parents are alert to the importance of monitoring adverse events in a systematic, meticulous manner. If methylphenidate is to continue to have a place in ADHD treatment in the future, we need to identify subgroups of patients in whom the benefits of methylphenidate outweigh the harms. Just as we need to be able to identify who is likely to benefit from treatment, we also need to be able to identify those who are most at risk of experiencing adverse events. In order to do this, we need to undertake large-scale, high-quality RCTs along with other studies aimed at identifying those who respond and those who do not respond to treatment.
We identified four studies, up to October 2013, which involved 245 people after stroke. A wide range of interventions was used, including driving simulation, training on devices to improve speed of processing information, scanning and movement. All studies compared the effectiveness of the driving intervention on improving whether drivers passed or failed on a driving assessment. There was no evidence that a driving intervention was more effective than no intervention. One trial found that training on a driving simulator resulted in improved performance on a test of recognising road signs immediately after training. Results should be interpreted with caution, as this was a single study. Further trials involving large numbers of participants, grouped according to their impairments and stroke type are required.
We wanted to find out whether duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy is better than any other type of pancreaticojejunostomy to improve:
- rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (proportion of participants with postoperative pancreatic fistula);
- death rate.
We also wanted to find out if duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy is associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared:
- duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy against any other type of pancreaticojejunostomy; or
- different types of duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 10 studies involving 1472 people in which duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy was compared with invagination pancreaticojejunostomy in people undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. The largest study included 308 people, and the smallest study included 64 people. The studies were conducted in countries around the world; most were done in China (4). Most studies lasted for approximately 2 years; only three studies lasted for 4 years or more. Non-commercial grants funded four of the studies. We cannot tell from the results of these studies whether duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy reduces:
- rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula; or
- death rate.
The studies did not report any unwanted effects.
We found only one single-center study involving 224 people in which modified duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy was compared with traditional duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy in people undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. The study was conducted in Japan and lasted for approximately 4 years. The study did not report its funding sources. We cannot tell from the results of this study whether modified duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy reduces:
- rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula; or
- death rate.
The study did not report any unwanted effects. We have very little confidence in the evidence because most of the studies included had some limitations in terms of how they were conducted or reported. The evidence is up to date to January 2021.
We found and included five studies in our review. Three studies were conducted by the same group of researchers in Israel (Weiner 2000; Weiner 2002; Weiner 2002a), one study (Sampaio 2002) was conducted in Brazil and one trial was conduced in the United Kingdom (McConnell 1998). A total of 113 adults with asthma (46 male and 67 female) were included. No study included children. The studies showed a significant improvement in inspiratory muscle strength (PImax). People with asthma who received IMT on average increased their inspiratory muscle strength, but it was not possible to state whether this improvement seen in inspiratory muscle strength translated into any clinical benefit. Results from one study showed no significant difference between the training group and the control group (no treatment or usual care) for expiratory muscle strength, lung function, sensation of dyspnoea (breathlessness) and use of reliever medication. There were no studies describing exacerbation events that required use of reliever medication or emergency department visits, inspiratory muscle endurance, hospital admissions and days off work or school. Given the insufficient evidence found in this review, we believe that there is a need for more well conducted studies in order to assess the efficacy of IMT in people with asthma, including children. There were substantial differences between the studies, including the training protocol, duration of training sessions (10 to 30 minutes) and duration of the intervention (over 3 to 25 weeks). The methodological quality of the studies included in this update was difficult to accurately ascertain. Study samples were small and the risk of bias was mostly unclear, due to inadequate reporting. Overall the quality of the evidence included in the review was very low. This summary was current to November 2012.
We identified six studies involving 7999 people receiving treatment with methadone (7786 people) or buprenorphine–naloxone (213 people ) for opioid dependence. Four of the studies were randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), while the other two studies followed groups of people over time. Four of the studies were funded by the National Institutes for Health Research and by the Health Research Board, with one study not reporting the funding source. One study was also funded by the drug company of buprenorphine–naloxone. At three or more months follow-up, this review found no evidence on benefit of the supervised dosing with respect to keep people in treatment, or reduce opioid use, mortality reduction and adverse drug events. One study found that supervised dosing led to a reduction of diversion. None of the studies assessed the effect of supervised dosing on pain symptoms, drug craving, days of unsanctioned opioid use, overdose and hospitalisation.
We are unable to make any conclusion about the effectiveness of supervised dosing compared to dispensing of medication as take-home doses, in the context of OST. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of supervised or take-home dosing in OST. Overall, the studies were moderately well-conducted, but there was a small number of studies reporting outcomes of interest, therefore insufficient to evaluate the efficacy of intervention such as diversion, opoid use reduction, retention in treatment and frequency of unsanctioned opioid use, Furthermore, low rates of occurrence of some events between studies resulted in the overall quality of the evidence being assessed as low and very low. This indicates that further evidence would be likely to change the estimates of relative effect made in this review.
We searched databases to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs - clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). We identified 12 relevant studies, which included a total of 1244 adults and children with cancer.
We included six studies (756 people) that compared giving antibiotics before the insertion of the CVC against not giving antibiotics. We found that giving an antibiotic before CVC insertion did not prevent infections. The studies authors' did not describe side-effects.
We included six studies (488 people) that compared an antibiotic solution with a heparin-only solution to flush/lock a CVC. We found that an antibiotic lock/flush solution reduced the number of CVC-related infections. People in one study reported an unpleasant taste after flushing, and one study found there were fewer CVC obstructions (e.g. a clot) in people who received the combined antibiotic and anticoagulant solution. We have moderate confidence in the evidence for giving antibiotics prior to CVC insertion and antibiotic lock/flush solutions since the studies were done in different people, used different types of catheters and antibiotics, and measured their results in different ways. We did not observe any benefit of giving antibiotics before the insertion of long-term CVCs to prevent gram-positive CVC-related infections. Flushing/locking long-term CVCs with an antibiotic appeared to reduce gram-positive CVC-related infections in people with cancer. It must be noted that the use of an antibiotic flush/lock solution may increase microbial antibiotic resistance, therefore it should be reserved for high-risk people or if baseline CVC-related infection rates are high.
This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to 19 November 2020.
This review identified 16 studies investigating antibiotics for UTI in children. Results suggest that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments; there was not enough data to draw conclusions about other treatment durations, or effectiveness of particular antibiotics. Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific regimen.
We identified 17 studies which compared premedication with a placebo prior to day case surgery. Twelve studies involved benzodiazepines (sedatives), two involved opioids (painkillers), two involved beta-blockers, one compared a benzodiazepine with a beta-blocker and one involved a herbal medication. In general, the studies were of poor quality and many used anaesthetic techniques which are no longer common. Only seven studies directly measured time to ambulation or discharge and found that this was not affected by the use of premedication. Some studies used specific tests to assess for residual effects of the premedication. Although these were often impaired after surgery, this did not appear to delay discharge.
We performed the present systematic review to determine the beneficial and harmful effects of dopamine agents for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Our analyses included five small trials published in 1982 or earlier. All trials but one had high risks of bias (i.e., risks of systematic errors or risks of overestimation of beneficial effects or risks of underestimation of harmful effects). Only 144 patients were included in the five trials, and accordingly risks of random errors (i.e., play of chance) are present. Our analyses showed no significant differences regarding symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy or mortality in patients treated with dopamine agents compared with patients who received an inactive placebo or no intervention. The number of patients with adverse events seemed comparable in the two intervention groups. Based on the available evidence, we conclude that no evidence can be found to recommend or refute the use of dopamine agents for hepatic encephalopathy. More randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials without risks of systematic errors and risks of random errors seem necessary to obtain firm evidence on dopamine agents for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.
This review found data in three clinical trials, involving 1202 people with moderate or severe pain after having wisdom teeth removed or after abdominal or pelvic surgery. These situations are used commonly to test analgesic effectiveness, because results are applicable to other forms of acute pain after trauma. Different types of surgery give very similar estimates of the effectiveness of analgesic drugs.
Ibuprofen 400 mg plus oxycodone 5 mg provided effective pain relief for about 6 in 10 (60%) of participants, compared with just under 2 in 10 (17%) of participants with placebo. The analgesic effects lasted longer and there were no more adverse events with the combination than with placebo. The combination provided effective pain relief to about the same proportion of people as did ibuprofen alone, but there was a lower chance of needing additional analgesia with the combination.
We identified 81 trials which were eligible for our review. We have presented the results for people with differing spectrum of alcohol-related liver disease separately.  Fifty randomised clinical trials included 4484 participants with alcoholic hepatitis. The period of follow-up ranged from one to 12 months. Because of the nature of the information available, we used methods similar to Cochrane methodology. None of the active interventions showed any improvement in any of the clinical outcomes reported in the trials, which includes deaths (at various time points), cirrhosis, liver failure or liver transplantation. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or incidence of primary liver cancer.
Severe alcoholic hepatitis
Of the trials on alcoholic hepatitis, 19 trials (2545 participants) included exclusively participants with severe alcoholic hepatitis. The period of follow-up ranged from one to 12 months. There was no alteration in the conclusions when only people with severe alcoholic hepatitis were included in the analysis. Eleven trials were funded by parties with vested interest in the results. Sixteen trials were funded by parties without vested interest in the results. The source of funding was not reported in 23 trials. Thirty-one randomised clinical trials included 3695 participants with other alcohol-related liver diseases (with a wide spectrum of alcohol-related liver diseases). The period of follow-up ranged from one to 48 months. The risk of deaths was lower in the propylthiouracil group than in the no intervention group and higher in the ursodeoxycholic acid group than in the no intervention group. However, these results are based on trials with methodological deficiencies that make the results unreliable. As a result, trials of low risk of bias of sufficient sample size are required before propylthiouracil can be recommended routinely. There was no evidence of improvement in any of the remaining clinical outcomes by any of the interventions compared with no intervention. Twelve trials were funded by parties with vested interest in the results. Three trials were funded by parties without vested interest in the results. The source of funding was not reported in 16 trials. The overall quality of the evidence was very low and all the trials were at unclear or high risk of bias, which means that there is possibility of making wrong conclusions overestimating benefits or underestimating harms of one treatment or the other because of the way that the studies were conducted. Further high-quality randomised clinical trials are necessary.
In April 2013, we did computer searches for randomized trials that compared the sponge with the diaphragm. For the original review, we looked at reference lists and book chapters to find trials. We also wrote to researchers to look for more trials.
We found two trials. In a large USA trial, the sponge did not work as well as the diaphragm in preventing pregnancy. For every 100 women who used the sponge for a year, about 17 got pregnant. Of those who used the diaphragm, 13 became pregnant. A U.K. trial found similar results. For each 100 women who used the sponge for a year, about 25 got pregnant. Of the diaphragm users, 11 became pregnant. We have not found any new trials since the initial review.
About 30% more women stopped using the sponge than the diaphragm. Allergy to the sponge was a problem for some women. However, discomfort caused about the same numbers of women to stop using their birth control method.
We included 10 randomized controlled trials (studies that allocate people randomly by chance to receive treatment) that compared oral immunotherapy to placebo (a fake treatment not containing egg) or an egg-avoidance diet for people with egg allergy. The 10 studies included a total of 439 children (249 in the oral immunotherapy group (treatment containing egg) and 190 in the control group (no egg)) who were aged from 1 year to 18 years. The evidence showed that treating egg allergy by giving a small, increasing amount of egg may help most children with egg allergy to tolerate a partial serving of egg, so long as they continued to consume a daily amount of egg protein. Side effects were frequent during oral immunotherapy treatment, but were usually mild-to-moderate. Nevertheless, 21 of 249 children treated with oral immunotherapy for egg allergy required medicine because of a serious reaction. The studies did not report information about quality of life of children and their families during oral immunotherapy treatment. The trials involved small numbers and there were problems with the way they were done, therefore further research is needed.
We found eight trials involving a total of 22,604 patients. We found that taking formoterol reduced the risk of having an exacerbation that was treated with oral corticosteroids, but none of the other benefits from taking formoterol were statistically significant. Guidelines suggest that long-acting beta-agonists should be given only to patients already taking an inhaled corticosteroid.
We could not find enough trials conducted in children to reach a conclusion on the benefits and harms in children, so we do not recommend using the results to make recommendations on treatment of children with asthma.
We found 17 randomised controlled trials (with 556 participants) to include in this review. We rated the quality of evidence provided by most of the included studies to be between low and very low. The studies could be divided into three different types of interventions: (1) exposure to bright light; (2) a napping opportunity during the night shift; or (3) others, like physical activity or sleep education. Bright light
Almost all of the bright light studies we looked at had some problem with the way they were designed. This problem made it difficult to know if any differences in sleepiness and sleep between those receiving bright light and those not receiving bright light were truly because of the bright light intervention. The studies were also too different in the types of bright light they used and types of light that the control groups received to compare them to one another.
Napping
The studies in the napping group did not report enough information for us to be certain whether napping helps shift workers feel more awake. The studies were very short, with each study lasting only a single night.
Others
This group of studies, which included, for example, physical exercise and sleep education, also reported too little information for us to say whether these interventions can make shift workers less sleepy on-shift or help them sleep longer and better after their shift. We conclude that there is too much uncertainty to determine whether any person-directed, non-drug interventions can really affect shift workers with sleepiness and sleep problems. We need studies that are better designed, report their designs and results more clearly, include more participants and last for a longer time before we can be certain. Studies also need to find out if their participants are 'morning-types' or 'evening-types', to be sure that the right type of shift worker gets the right type of intervention. We searched for studies that had been published up to August 2015.
We wanted to find out if (1) using cell salvage reduces the need for a transfusion of donated blood, and (2) if people still needed a transfusion, did it reduce the amount of donated blood that they needed. We also wanted to check if people who have cell salvage have more complications than those who don't. We searched for studies that compared using cell salvage versus no cell salvage (usual care) in adults having elective operations: that is, the operations were planned in advance, not needed urgently because of a trauma. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 106 studies involving 14,528 participants from 24 countries, published between 1978 and 2021. Studies focused on different types of surgery.  2 studies (79 participants)
Inconclusive evidence means we are unsure of the impact of cell salvage. 6 studies (384 participants)
Inconclusive evidence means we are unsure of the impact of cell salvage. 6 studies (372 participants)
There is probably a reduction in the risk of needing a transfusion of donated blood because of cell salvage. For other outcomes, we are uncertain of the impact of cell salvage. 29 studies (2936 participants)
There may be a reduction in the risk of needing a transfusion of donated blood because of cell salvage. For other outcomes, we are uncertain of the impact of cell salvage. 1 study (1356 participants)
Inconclusive evidence suggests there may be no difference in the risk of needing a transfusion of donated blood, alongside strong evidence that suggests there is no difference in the average amount of donated blood that is needed by the patient, because of cell salvage. 17 studies (2055 participants)
Inconclusive evidence means we are unsure of the impact of cell salvage. 26 studies (2568 participants)
Inconclusive evidence means we are unsure of the impact of cell salvage. 6 studies (404 participants)
There is probably a reduction in the risk of needing a transfusion of donated blood because of cell salvage. For other outcomes, we are uncertain of the impact of cell salvage. 14 RCTs (4374 participants)
Inconclusive evidence means we are unsure of the impact of cell salvage. We have little confidence in the evidence for some outcomes and are not confident about the evidence for others. This is because it is possible that the people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and some of the studies were small. The evidence is up-to-date to January 2023, and it expands and updates the evidence reported in the previous review (2010).
This review did not find any high quality research evidence showing that HBOT is beneficial for wound healing. Two poor quality studies suggested benefits associated with HBOT. The first, in patients with crush injuries, showed improved wound healing and fewer adverse outcomes. The second reported improved survival of split skin grafts in people with burn wounds. Two trials reported no benefits associated with HBOT for either skin grafting or free flap surgery.
Further, better quality research is needed to determine the effects of HBOT on wound healing.
In our review, we looked at 27 randomized controlled trials of drugs compared to placebo to find out which treatments were effective at providing pain freedom two hours after treatment. We also wanted to know what side effects might be caused by the treatments. A total of 7630 children received medication in the studies. The evidence is current to February 2016. Each study had between 13 and 888 participants. Their average age was 12.9 years and ranged from 8.2 to 14.7 years. Nineteen of the studies were funded by the drug manufacturer. Ibuprofen appears to be effective in treating children with migraine, but the evidence is limited to only two small trials. Ibuprofen is readily available and inexpensive, making it an excellent first choice for migraine treatment. Paracetamol was not shown to be effective in providing pain freedom in children, but we only found one small study. Triptans are a type of medication designed specifically to treat migraine and are often effective at providing greater pain freedom in children and adolescents. The triptans examined in children included rizatriptan and sumatriptan, while almotriptan, eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan were examined in adolescents. The combination of sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium is also effective at treating adolescents with migraine. Overall, there is a risk that the triptan medications may cause minor unwanted side effects like taste disturbance, nasal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, low energy, nausea, or vomiting. The studies did not report any serious side effects. The overall quality of the evidence provided by the review was moderate for the triptans, but low for paracetamol and ibuprofen, as we only identified a few studies. More studies need to look at the effects of each of the migraine treatments in children and adolescents separately.
However the review found that people have withdrawn from trials when they are assigned to a drug-free program. Consequently, there are no trials comparing methadone maintenance treatment with drug-free methods other than methadone placebo trials, or comparing methadone maintenance with methadone for detoxification only. These trials show that methadone can reduce the use of heroin in dependent people, and keep them in treatment programs.
This review found there was not enough evidence from trials to answer some important questions about vaccination for meningococcal meningitis. Meningitis is the most common manifestation of invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) . Other clinical manifestations include septicaemia, conjunctivitis, pericarditis and arthritis. Meningitis and septicaemia can be rapidly fatal if untreated. N. meningitidis is a normal commensal of the throat and may be found in about 10% of a healthy population. Reasons why the bacteria may become invasive to cause disease are unclear. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed that the polysaccharide serogroup A vaccine prevented meningitis caused by the serogroup A strain of meningococci, and the vaccine has since been used effectively to control epidemics. However, observational studies suggested variations in the level and duration of protection, particularly among younger children, thus resulting in different interpretations of the potential value of routine vaccinations. The review was conducted to provide a summary estimate of the efficacy of the vaccine, its effectiveness in children under five years old, and its duration of protection. Results from 8 out of 12 eligible RCTs were included, and showed the vaccine highly protective in the first year after vaccination: the summary estimate of efficacy was 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87% to 99%). Although protection extended to the third year after vaccination, the results were not statistically significant. The vaccine was protective in Finnish children aged three months to five years, but the effect of a booster dose in children under two years was not statistically significant. The vaccine was protective in one- to five-year old children in low-income countries but its effectiveness by one or two-year age strata in this age group could not be determined. Two of 15 eligible non-RCTs were included in the analysis, but were at high risk of bias.
We found that a lot of shorter studies had been conducted, but only one study met our criteria for this review. It took place in the UK and included two different types of online cognitive training. The control group participated in an online game that was not expected to have cognitive effects. This training lasted six months, and study authors measured cognition at the end of the training period. Resarchers randomised 6742 people in the study, but the dropout rate was high. We thought this put the results at high risk of bias; therefore we considered the quality of evidence provided by this study to be low, meaning that further research might well lead to different results. This study did not measure overall cognitive functioning - which we were most interested in - but it did measure some subtypes of cognitive function. The cognitive training group did slightly better on a test of reasoning, and the control group did very slightly better on a test of working memory, which is a very short-term type of memory. No evidence suggested that the groups differed in memory measured by a word-learning test. We were not able to tell whether taking part in computerised cognitive training in midlife has any lasting effects on cognitive function. We think this is an important question that should be investigated further in trials that test cognitive training over three months or longer. It will also be important for researchers to try to find the best ways to keep people motivated to persist with training.
This review found three small studies, that provide no evidence to justify the use of this drug in asthma.
In this review, we wanted to investigate interventions aimed at reducing the anticholinergic medicines prescribed to older adults. We wanted to know if these interventions were better than usual care for improving cognition and reducing diagnoses of dementia in older adults. We also wanted to know if reducing overall anticholinergic burden had any harmful effects. We searched for studies that evaluated interventions to reduce anticholinergic burden compared with usual care in older adults. For the comparison to be fair, people had to be allocated randomly to the intervention or the usual care group. We included older people who had no cognitive problems and people who did, including those with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in their findings, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found three relevant trials that recruited a total of 299 older adults. All three trials included a mixture of people with and without cognitive problems. They were all short trials, measuring cognition just one to three months after the intervention. Only two trials were successful in reducing the overall anticholinergic burden of the intervention group. However, one of these trials reported that people in the intervention group did no better on cognitive tests than people who had usual care, and the other trial found that people in the intervention group had better scores in only one of several cognitive tests. No trials found that interventions to reduce anticholinergic burden led to any other improvements compared to usual care, and no trials investigated how safe the interventions were. Our overall confidence in the results is very low. The trials had small numbers of participants, did not study people who already had cognitive problems separately from those who did not, and had mixed success in reducing anticholinergic burden. From the available evidence, we cannot say whether interventions to reduce anticholinergic burden are safe and effective for preserving or improving cognition in older people. We searched for studies published up to 1 November 2022.
We reviewed the literature to determine the benefits and harms of antihypertensive treatment in people with diabetes who did not have signs of kidney disease. We found 26 studies involving 61,264 participants that compared antihypertensive drugs with placebo (an neutral agent with no therapeutic benefits or harms), no treatment, and other antihypertensive drugs. A family of drugs called ACEi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) has been shown to prevent new onset of kidney disease and reduce the numbers of deaths in people with diabetes who have normal levels of albumin in their urine compared with placebo or calcium channel blocking drugs. We found no significant effect from angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs on either development of ESKD or death.
Subgroup analyses that suggested similar benefits from ARB for people with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of heart disease or should be interpreted cautiously. Direct comparison of ACEi and ARB in this population showed no difference in preventing DKD. The benefits of ACEi are consistent, and ACEi could be the first choice intervention for primary prevention of DKD.
This review sought to determine if the exit interview was useful in achieving this purpose. However, after a wide search, no studies answering the question were found. Further research in this area is needed.
We found consistently strong evidence that the vaccine is effective in preventing the rarer outcome of invasive pneumococcal disease. Evidence from the included studies indicates vaccination might not afford as much protection in adults with chronic illness as it does for healthy adults. The available evidence does not demonstrate that pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines prevent pneumonia (of all causes) or mortality in adults. This review did not consider adverse events as it was outside the scope of the study.
Endometriosis is a painful condition where endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. It can cause cysts and infertility. Danazol is a hormone that produces male characteristics as well as weight gain and acne. It does, however, relieve the painful symptoms of endometriosis, although the side effects can be unacceptable. The improvement was still present six months after treatment was stopped. There was some evidence that women who took danazol were satisfied with the treatment compared with women who had inactive treatment.
We included 22 studies comparing surgery with non-surgical interventions, or comparing different types of surgery. Altogether 1496 participants were allocated to surgery and 302 participants to non-surgical interventions. Most studies followed participants for 12 to 36 months, the longest follow-up was 10 years. The majority of participants were women and, on average, in their early 30s to early 50s. Seven studies compared surgery with non-surgical interventions. Due to differences in the way that the studies were designed we decided not to generate an average of their results. The direction of the effect indicated that people who had surgery achieved greater weight loss one to two years afterwards compared with people who did not have surgery. Improvements in quality of life and diabetes were also found. No deaths occurred, reoperations in the surgical intervention groups ranged between 2% and 13%, as reported in five studies.
Three studies found that gastric bypass (GB) achieved greater weight loss up to five years after surgery compared with adjustable gastric band (AGB): the BMI at the end of the studies was on average five units less. The GB procedure resulted in greater duration of hospitalisation and a greater number of late major complications. AGB required high rates of reoperation for removal of the gastric band.
Seven studies compared GB with sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Overall there were no important differences for weight loss, quality of life, comorbidities and complications, although gastro-oesophageal reflux disease improved in more patients following GB in one study. One death occurred in the GB group. Serious adverse events occurred in 5% of the GB group and 1% of SG group, as reported in one study. Two studies reported 7% to 24% of people with GB and 3% to 34% of those with SG requiring reoperations.
Two studies found that biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch resulted in greater weight loss than GB after two or four years in people with a relatively high BMI. BMI at the end of the studies was on average seven units lower. One death occurred in the biliopancreatic diversion group. Reoperations were higher in the biliopancreatic diversion group (16% to 28%) than the GB group (4% to 8%).
One study comparing duodenojejunal bypass with SG versus GB found weight loss outcomes and rates of remission of diabetes and hypertension were similar at 12 months follow-up. No deaths occurred in either group, reoperation rates were not reported.
One study found that BMI was reduced by 10 units more following SG at three years follow-up compared with AGB. Reoperations occurred in 20% of the AGB group and in 10% of the SG group.
One study found no relevant difference in weight-loss outcomes following gastric imbrication compared with SG. No deaths occurred; 17% of participants in the gastric imbrication group required reoperation. From the information that was available to us about the studies, we were unable to assess how well designed they were. Adverse events and reoperation rates were not consistently reported in the publications of the studies. Most studies followed participants for only one or two years, therefore the long-term effects of surgery remain unclear.
Few studies assessed the effects of bariatric surgery in treating comorbidities in participants with a lower BMI. There is therefore a lack of evidence for the use of bariatric surgery in treating comorbidities in people who are overweight or who do not meet standard criteria for bariatric surgery. This evidence is up to date as of November 2013.
This review found 28 studies on five second-generation antipsychotic drugs (amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone) comparing the effects of the drugs alone or adding them or placebo to antidepressants for major depressive disorder and dysthymia. There is evidence that amisulpride might lead to symptom reduction in dysthymia, while no important differences were seen for major depression. There is limited evidence that aripiprazole leads to symptom reduction when added to antidepressants. Olanzapine had no beneficial effects for treatment of depression when compared to antidepressants or compared to placebo but there was limited evidence for the benefits of olanzapine as additional treatment. Data on quetiapine indicated beneficial effects for quetiapine alone or as additional treatment when compared to placebo; data on quetiapine versus duloxetine did not show beneficial effects in terms of symptom reduction for either group, but quetiapine treatment was less well tolerated. The data, however, are very limited. Slight benefits of risperidone as additional treatment, in terms of symptom reduction, are also based on a rather small number of randomised participants. Generally, treatment with second-generation antipsychotic drugs was associated with worse tolerability, mainly due to sedation, weight gain or laboratory values such as prolactin increase.
This review found only one randomized trial of treatment for spasticity in motor neuron disease, which involved 25 participants, and no further trials have been found in subsequent updates. There were a number of issues with the design of the study which unfortunately reduced the certainty of the findings. At three months participants performing the 15 minute twice daily exercises had significantly less spasticity overall than control participants (mean reduction of -0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.03 to +0.17 in the treatment group versus an increase of +0.25, 95% CI -0.46 to +0.96 in control) but the mean change between groups was not significant, as measured by the Ashworth scale (a scale of spasticity, with a range of 0 to 5, where higher is worse). The trial was too small to determine whether individualized moderate intensity endurance type exercises for the trunk and limbs are beneficial or harmful. No side effects from exercise were reported. No other randomized trials of different treatments or therapies were found. Further research is needed to determine if exercise or other therapies such as anti-spasticity medication are beneficial or harmful.
Our systematic search (to December 2017) identified 35 studies, enrolling 3429 patients. Vasopressin receptor antagonists have unclear effects on the risk of death and quality of life, with additional studies needed to answer these questions. They likely improve the blood sodium concentration, but it sometimes happens too quickly. In addition, people who take vasopressin receptor antagonists may experience increased thirst and urine output. There is very little information for any of the other available treatments. In people with low blood sodium concentration, vasopressin receptor antagonists modestly raised the sodium concentration. The effects on mortality and health-related quality of life are unclear and do not rule out appreciable benefit or harm; there does not appear to be an important effect on cognitive function, but hospital stay may be slightly shorter, although available data are limited. Evidence for other treatments is largely absent.
Some medications increase the risk of falling. Three trials in this review failed to reduce the number of falls by reviewing and adjusting medications. A fourth trial involving family physicians and their patients in medication review was effective in reducing falls. Gradual withdrawal of a particular type of drug for improving sleep, reducing anxiety, and treating depression (psychotropic medication) has been shown to reduce falls.
Cataract surgery reduces falls in women having the operation on the first affected eye. Insertion of a pacemaker can reduce falls in people with frequent falls associated with carotid sinus hypersensitivity, a condition which causes sudden changes in heart rate and blood pressure.
In people with disabling foot pain, the addition of footwear assessment, customised insoles, and foot and ankle exercises to regular podiatry reduced the number of falls but not the number of people falling.
The evidence relating to the provision of educational materials alone for preventing falls is inconclusive.
This review of 10 studies evaluated six different drugs. The only drug for which there was any evidence of benefit was piracetam, but the evidence of benefit was weak and there were concerns about its safety. It was not possible to conclude whether piracetam was more effective than speech and language therapy in treating aphasia after stroke. More research is needed into the effects of piracetam on aphasia, and its safety, before it can be recommended for routine use.
We wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for ASD by systematically reviewing all studies of acupuncture for ASD where people were randomly allocated to a treatment or control group (placebo, sham or no treatment), i.e. randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched through 15 databases, most recently in September 2010, and read over the titles and abstracts to make sure we identified everything relevant. We found10 RCTs to include in this review. These studies, which were carried out in Hong Kong, mainland China and Egypt, involved 390 children aged between three and 18 years.
Two studies compared needle acupuncture with sham acupuncture and found no difference in core autistic features. Results did suggest that needle acupuncture might be associated with improvement in other areas of communication and linguistic ability, cognitive function and global functioning.
Six studies compared needle acupuncture plus conventional treatment with conventional treatment alone. They used a range of tools to measure core autistic features and most could not show that acupuncture led to improvement in these. One trial did report, though, that needle acupuncture led to an improvement in scores on Autism Behavior Checklist. There was no evidence for improvement due to acupuncture on communication and linguistic ability but it might be beneficial for cognitive function and global functioning.
Two studies compared acupressure plus conventional treatment with conventional treatment alone and found no difference in core autistic features, although acupressure seemed to improve some aspects of the secondary outcomes.
Problems that were noted by parents of study participants included crying due to fear or pain, bleeding, sleep disturbance and increased hyperactivity. It is unclear if these were due to the acupuncture treatment. Half of the trials reported some negative effects but did not report how often or how severe these were and sometimes the problems occurred in both the treatment and control groups. None of the studies used measures of quality of life.
Overall, acupuncture did not seem to be effective in improving core features of ASD but it might have improved certain developmental and functioning outcomes, at least in the short term.
There are problems with assessing acupuncture due to the quality of the evidence. There were a small number of studies and they were all conducted with children. Moreover, there is a high likelihood that they may have been biased due to the methods used not being rigorous enough, the wide variety in the people and interventions in the studies, the inconsistent and imprecise reporting of results and the large number of analyses carried out, which make it more likely a significant result will be found just by chance.
In conclusion, current evidence does not support the use of acupuncture for the treatment of ASD. We need high quality trials of larger size and longer follow-up as the evidence base at present has many limitations.
We searched for evidence (July 2019) and included nine small randomised controlled trials (944 women). The studies were conducted in hospital settings in Pakistan, Turkey, Thailand, Egypt (four studies) and Saudi Arabia, and health facilities in Benin and Mali. Overall, the studies were very different, with various interventions being compared. The small number of women in each study, few or zero events, lack of data on important outcomes, and wide variation in results meant that few clear findings were obtained. It was not possible to pool the results from the studies. Our certainty assessments for the trials ranged from low to very low, with the majority rated as very low certainty. This means that we cannot be confident about the results.
Two studies (356 women) compared internal pressure using non-commercial balloons (a water-filled condom  and a sterilised, air-filled 'party' balloon) and normal care. The condom catheter may result in increased blood loss, but no other important effects were seen in either study. A third study found that the condom catheter may reduce postpartum fever compared to packing of the uterus with gauze, but no other effects.
Three studies used a commercially available balloon (Bakri). This was compared to external pressure with stitches in one study (13 women) and it was found that Bakri balloon may reduce blood loss but no other effects were seen. Another study (66 women) compared the Bakri balloon to a condom system and found little to no differences between groups. The third study (50 women) looked to see if using a stitch to tether the upper end of the balloon to the top of the uterus had any benefit, but found little to no effect.
One study (64 women) compared external compression of the uterus with normal care but with no clear findings. Another study of 160 women compared a standard compression suture with a modified version in which the uterus is not only compressed, but the main vessel supplying the uterus was tied off. The results suggested that the modified suture may reduce blood loss and the risk of hysterectomy.
One study (23 women) compared using imaging to block the blood vessels to the uterus (uterine artery embolisation) with surgical techniques to cut off the blood supply and compress the uterus but found little to no effect. We did not find sufficient high-quality evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of mechanical and surgical interventions for treating primary PPH. High-quality randomised trials are urgently needed to test some of the findings of this review. We urge new trial authors to adopt standardised PPH core outcomes.
We searched for studies published up to February 2016.
Our search identified seven studies which investigated changes made to the way organizations offered stop-smoking support in healthcare settings; six studies were conducted in the USA and one in Spain. Two studies evaluated the changes implemented in primary care clinics and another two studies evaluated changes in dental clinics. One study each evaluated changes in community pharmacy, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and pediatric practice. All included studies were supported or funded by government agencies.
None of the studies implemented all the recommended changes or activities listed above. Five studies implemented four types of changes and two studies implemented three types of changes. Identifying all smokers, training health professionals and advising smokers to quit were part of all included studies. Of the seven studies identified, only four evaluated the effect of organizational changes on study participants' quitting status. Of these, two found that organizational changes helped people to quit smoking, but the other two studies reported that they did not, and hence no conclusion could be drawn on this factor. Activities such as counselling to quit, recording smoking status in patient health records, and referring smokers to an outside stop-smoking clinic improved after those changes were made. Of the three studies which evaluated factors such as asking about tobacco use and advising to quit, two reported that organizational changes could improve both of those factors. The overall quality of the evidence was judged to be low because of the small number of available studies and inadequate study designs. More well-conducted studies are needed to fill this knowledge gap. Some studies are already underway but need to be evaluated in detail to include in the review.
We wanted to know if erythromycin was better than placebo (any dummy treatment) or other medicines to improve the following outcomes.
• Death caused by upper gastrointestinal bleeding
• Serious unwanted events
• Death by any cause
• Mild unwanted events
• Ease of viewing the stomach during endoscopy
• Rebleeding
• Need for blood transfusion
• Need for rescue procedure (such as surgery) We searched for studies that investigated the use of erythromycin compared with no treatment, placebo, or other medicines in adults with upper gastrointestinal bleeding who underwent upper endoscopy. We compared and summarised their results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included findings from 11 studies involving 878 adults with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Most participants were men, and the average ages ranged from 53 years to 64 years. The studies were conducted in several different countries. They compared erythromycin with placebo, lavage of the stomach with a nasogastric tube (injecting and sucking out water or saline through a tube inserted through the nose and with the tip placed inside the stomach), and metoclopramide (a medicine that speeds up the emptying of the stomach). Erythromycin compared with placebo
Three studies (255 people) compared erythromycin with placebo. There were no deaths related to bleeding. We do not know if erythromycin has an effect on serious unwanted events, death by any cause, mild unwanted effects, or rebleeding. Erythromycin may make it easier to see the stomach during endoscopy and may reduce blood transfusion slightly.
Erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage versus no treatment/placebo plus nasogastric tube lavage
Six studies (408 people) compared erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage with no treatment/placebo plus nasogastric tube lavage. There were no deaths related to bleeding and no serious unwanted events. We do not know if erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage compared to no treatment/placebo plus nasogastric tube lavage has an effect on death by any cause, ease of viewing the stomach, mild unwanted events, rebleeding, or blood transfusion.
Erythromycin versus nasogastric tube lavage
Four studies (287 people) compared erythromycin with nasogastric tube lavage. There were no deaths related to bleeding and no severe unwanted events. We do not know if erythromycin compared with nasogastric tube lavage has any effect on death by any cause, ease of viewing the stomach, mild unwanted events, rebleeding, or blood transfusion.
Erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage versus metoclopramide plus nasogastric tube lavage
One study (30 people) compared erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage with metoclopramide plus nasogastric tube lavage. We do not know if erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage has an effect on any of the reported outcomes. Due to a lack of solid evidence, the benefits and harms of erythromycin before endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding remain unclear. However, erythromycin compared with placebo may make it easier to see the stomach during endoscopy and may reduce blood transfusion slightly. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of erythromycin in people with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We have very little confidence in the evidence because the results varied widely across studies, and the studies involved only small numbers of people. Some reports did not clearly describe how the study was conducted, or whether the people taking part knew who had received which medicine, which could have affected the results. Further research is likely to change our results. The evidence is up to date to October 2021.
This review included thirteen randomized controlled trials comparing abstinence-only programs to various control groups (e.g., "usual care," no intervention). Although we conducted an extensive international search for trials, all included studies enrolled youth in the US (total baseline enrollment=15,940 participants). Programs were conducted in schools, community centers, and family homes; all were delivered in family units or groups of young people. We could not conduct a meta-analysis because of missing data and variation in program designs. However, findings from the individual trials were remarkably consistent.
Overall, the trials did not indicate that abstinence-only programs can reduce HIV risk as indicated by behavioral outcomes (e.g., unprotected vaginal sex) or biological outcomes (e.g., sexually transmitted infection). Instead, the programs consistently had no effect on participants' incidence of unprotected vaginal sex, frequency of vaginal sex, number of sex partners, sexual initiation, or condom use.
One trial favored an abstinence-only program over usual care for incidence of vaginal sex (n=839), but this was limited to two-month follow-up and was offset by measurement error and six other studies with non-significant effects (n=2615).
One evaluation found several significant adverse (harmful) program effects: abstinence-only program participants were more likely than usual-care controls to report sexually transmitted infections (n=2711), pregnancy (n=1548), and increased frequency of vaginal sex (n=338). These effects were offset by high attrition and other studies showing non-significant effects.
We concluded that abstinence-only programs do not appear to reduce or exacerbate HIV risk among participants in high-income countries, although this evidence might not apply beyond US youth. Trial limitations included underreporting of relevant outcomes, reliance on program participants to report their behaviors accurately, and methodological weaknesses in the trials.
We found 5 studies randomising 250 participants. One study looked at kidney transplant patients, and four studies looked at liver transplant patients, mostly taking synbiotics, prebiotics or probiotics within a month after surgery. We are uncertain whether probiotics improve bowel and gut side effects or reduce your chance of getting an infection after the surgery. We are uncertain whether these treatments will help stool characteristics, kidney function, or the amount of immunosuppression medications to take.
The quality of the evidence that we found is poor. Three studies were only abstracts (not the full paper and not the full results). All five studies were conducted using moderate to poor quality methods and too few patients. Currently, we do not have enough information from trials to know whether synbiotics, prebiotics or probiotics work to improve the recovery in people with a solid organ transplant. Six studies are currently ongoing (822 proposed participants), therefore it is possible that findings may change with the inclusion of these studies in future updates.
The evidence is up to date to 9 March 2022.
The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of this treatment. As a result of the small number of studies that we were able to include in this review and the limitations of those studies, we were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of meditation therapy for ADHD. No adverse effects of meditation in children have been reported. More trials are needed on meditation therapies for ADHD so that conclusions can be drawn regarding its effectiveness.
This review of trials found there was not enough evidence to show that potassium is effective in desensitising teeth. More research is needed.
We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low-birth-weight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants with a symptomatic PDA diagnosed using a combination of specific clinical features and ultrasound of the heart. The included studies compared early treatment, or very early treatment of a symptomatic PDA with NSAIDs compared to expectant management without the use of NSAIDs. The search is up to date as of 2 October 2020. This review of 14 clinical trials (910 infants) found that early or very early treatment of a symptomatic PDA does not reduce death or other poor clinical outcomes in preterm infants. Early or very early treatment, on the other hand, appears to increase the number of preterm infants exposed to NSAIDs. There are currently two trials awaiting classification and two ongoing trials exploring this question. According to GRADE (a method to score the certainty of the trials supporting each outcome), the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to moderate but was moderate for the most important outcome of death.
This updated systematic review, including 633 participants in three randomised controlled trials, suggests that omentoplasty could reduce the incidence of anastomotic leakage and the duration of hospital stay after operation. Although the difference in anastomotic leakage was significant only among patients undergoing THE, the risk ratios of omentoplasty for THE and TTE were similar. In addition, omentoplasty does not appear to increase or decrease hospital mortality nor the incidence of postoperative complications, such as anastomotic stricture, pulmonary and cardiac complications, infection, vocal cord palsy and perijejunostomy leakage. Additional clinical trials are needed to investigate the influences of omentoplasty on the incidence of anastomotic leakage and anastomotic stricture, long-term survival, duration of hospital stay and quality of life after oesophagectomy and oesophagogastrostomy when different surgical approaches are used.
Although withdrawing CNI treatment resulted in more rejections in the short term, there was no clear change in transplanted organ failure, death, development of cancer, or infections. Replacing CNI with another group of drugs - the mTOR inhibitors - did not significantly change outcomes, except for fewer cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Lower CNI dose was associated with fewer episodes of kidney transplant rejection and loss, but only in the first year to up to five years after the transplant. We found that the long-term outcomes for stopping or gradually reducing CNI therapy were not clear, and that mTOR inhibitors can reduce CMV infections with a higher risk of acute rejection. There were insufficient studies with long term follow-up to clearly determine which treatment is better for people who receive kidney transplants.
This review identified nine RCTs, with a total of 3144 participants, and compared treatment with linezolid against treatment with vancomycin for skin and soft tissue infections. No new trials were identified for this first update. Linezolid was found to be more effective than vancomycin for treating these infections. There were fewer skin complications in the group that were treated with linezolid. There were no differences between the two groups in the number of reported deaths, and those treated with linezolid had shorter lengths of hospital stay than those treated with vancomycin. The daily cost of outpatient therapy was less with oral linezolid than with intravenous vancomycin, although for inpatient treatment, linezolid was more expensive than vancomycin. Well-designed trials will be required in future to confirm these results, as the trials from which these conclusions were drawn were of poor methodological quality, at high risk of bias, and were funded by the pharmaceutical company that makes linezolid.
This updated review evaluated the effectiveness of various rehabilitation programmes for patients who had lumbar disc surgery for the first time. We included 22 randomised controlled trials with 2503 participants, both men and women, between the ages of 18 and 65 years. The evidence is current to May 2013. Most commonly, treatment started four to six weeks after surgery, but the start of treatment ranged from two hours to 12 months after surgery. Considerable variation in the content, duration and intensity of treatments (i.e. exercise programmes) has been noted. The duration of the interventions varied from two weeks to one year; most programmes lasted six to 12 weeks. Participants reported on average serious pain intensity (56 points on a zero to 100 scale, with 100 being the worst possible pain). Most studies compared (1) exercise versus no treatment, (2) high-intensity exercise versus low-intensity exercise or (3) supervised exercise versus home exercise, most commonly starting four to six weeks after surgery. Comparisons in this review included (1) exercise versus no treatment, (2) high-intensity versus low-intensity exercise and (3) supervised versus home exercise. Patients who participated in exercise programmes four to six weeks after surgery reported slightly less short-term pain and disability than those who received no treatment. Patients who participated in high-intensity exercise programmes reported slightly less short-term pain and disability than those participating in low-intensity exercise programmes. Patients in supervised exercise programmes reported little or no difference in pain and disability compared with those in home exercise programmes. Here it was difficult to draw firm conclusions in the absence of high-quality evidence.
None of the trials reported an increase in reoperation rate after first-time lumbar surgery.
The evidence does not show whether all patients should be treated after surgery or only those who still have symptoms four to six weeks later. Limitations in the methods of half of the trials suggest that the results should be read with caution. Most of the treatments were assessed in only one trial. Therefore for most of the interventions, only low- to very low-quality evidence indicates that no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding their effectiveness.
We included 12 trials, with a total of 30,412 participants, in this review. Treating high blood pressure with medicines may reduce the risk of dementia and problems with memory and thinking, but we were unable to confirm this using the data we have available. This may be due to shortcomings in the evidence available.
Some participants had side effects from medications, such as falls, that led to them stopping the medications. This is also an important consideration. We were unable to find evidence to confirm that treating high blood pressure with medicines will prevent future dementia or problems with memory and thinking. Based on the evidence available, all we can say is that the methods used in the studies we looked at were not sufficient to answer our study question. In practice, we want to know if treating high blood pressure in mid-life reduces dementia and problems with memory and thinking in later life. These studies were too short in duration to answer this question. They tended to be designed to investigate heart attack and stroke as outcome measures, with memory and thinking tests added on, which means they were less likely to include the numbers of people with problems with memory and thinking necessary to reliably answer the question. In the studies comparing active medicines and placebo (inactive medicine), many people in the placebo groups ultimately did receive active medicine which further complicated the results.
Antihypertensive treatment may prevent new problems with memory and thinking, or dementia, or both, despite the findings of this review. To be more confident in our conclusions, we would need studies that have more distinct treatment and placebo groups, and that treat participants starting at a younger age and with a longer follow-up.
We found a total of six studies including 2100 participants: four studies including 792 people could be pooled for the main results, and two other studies were looked at separately because their designs were very different (n = 1213 and n = 95). People in the four pooled studies in general took regular medications and we excluded those with severe asthma or other lung diseases. We looked at two other studies with very different designs to the main four separately: one compared a practice where people with asthma were given the option of a telephone check-up or a practice visit where they came to the clinic as usual, and one looked specifically at using technology to monitor people while cutting down their oral steroids dose. We last looked for studies on 24 November 2015. We cannot say whether or not people who had a check-up over the phone or internet were more or less likely to need oral corticosteroids for an asthma attack than those seen face-to-face, and we were uncertain of the result for several reasons. Too few people had asthma attacks that needed treatment in the Emergency Department or hospital, or an unscheduled visit to see their doctor to tell if remote check-ups were as good as face-to-face consultations. There didn't appear to be a difference in asthma control or quality of life, but we were able to rule out the possibility that remote check-ups are not as good as face-to-face consultations on these measures. The evidence was all considered to be of low or moderate quality. The study that tested the possible benefit of giving people the option of a telephone check-up showed that this increased the number of people reviewed, but did not show an overall benefit on asthma outcomes.
Our primary goal was to find out whether there are differences in how migrant (i.e. having moved to live in a foreign country) women and men access, understand, appraise and apply health information. To help us understand the evidence, we used an approach called the 'best fit framework' and a model known as 'health literacy information processing'. The four steps of health information processing - the ability to access, understand, appraise and apply health information - are what we define as a person's 'health literacy'. We were interested in qualitative studies (e.g. studies where people share their opinions and perspectives on a certain health topic through interviews or group discussions). We conducted another review alongside this one to find out the effectiveness of different interventions to improve the health literacy of migrant women and men. We then integrated the findings of that review with this one to explain to what extent gender- and migration-specific factors may play a role in the development and delivery of health literacy interventions.
For this qualitative review, we searched for qualitative studies that were directly related to the interventions in the linked effectiveness review. We were interested in studies that were conducted alongside the effectiveness studies. These were studies that explored the perceptions and opinions of people from different cultural backgrounds on a certain health topic to help develop an intervention, or explore their experiences with an intervention that they had participated in. We used the four steps of the health information processing model (described above) to guide our synthesis of these data. We also assessed the quality of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as adequacy and relevance. We included 27 studies. Eleven studies included only women, one study included only men, and 15 studies included both women and men. The age of study participants ranged from 26 to 87 years. Most studies were conducted in the USA or Canada and primarily included people of Latino/Latina/Hispanic origin (e.g. from the Caribbean, Central America or South America). The second most common origin of people was Asian (e.g. Chinese, Korean, Punjabi). The length of time participants had been living in the new country ranged from one month up to 38 years.
Three studies of migrant women provided evidence on aspects that were related to migrant women, some of which also indicated differences between women and men.
Regarding accessing health information, migrant women of Afghan and Korean background in two studies preferred access to a female rather than a male doctor for personal reasons, such as feelings of shame or humiliation, or due to cultural norms. Another finding regarding access was the perception of husbands as gatekeepers; women of Afghan background mentioned that in their culture, men are the head of the household and decision-maker in the household, including about personal health matters that affect the women. Our third finding about access was that Afghan women's limited English proficiency impeded their access to health information and services.
Regarding understanding health information, we identified low literacy levels amongst Afghan women as they reported limited ability in writing and reading.
We did not find any evidence about the third step of health information processing - appraising health information.
Regarding applying health information, women of Mexican and Afghan background stated that the role of women in the community prevented them from maintaining their own health and making themselves a priority; this impeded applying health information. We rated our confidence in the evidence as moderate. We had minor to very minor concerns regarding methodological limitations in the studies, but serious concerns regarding the adequacy of the evidence as the evidence on gender aspects stems from only three studies and those studies included women only. We were not able to explore migrant men's health literacy due to the lack of research involving men.
We suggest that more research on male migrants' perceived health literacy and their health-related challenges is needed, particularly to explore potential differences between women and men. Moreover, there is a need for more research in different countries and healthcare systems to create a more comprehensive picture of aspects of health literacy in the context of migration. We searched for studies electronically until May 2021. We conducted handsearching and contacted study authors until September 2022.
Physical rehabilitation (interventions based on exercising the body) may have a role, and this review examines the evidence available. This review included 67 trials, 36 of which were conducted in North America, 20 in Europe, and seven in Asia. In total, 6300 participants with an average age of 83 years were involved. Most interventions in some way addressed difficulties in activities of daily living. This review investigates the effects of physical rehabilitation on activities of daily living, strength, flexibility, balance, mood, cognition (memory and thinking), exercise tolerance, fear of falling, death, illness, and unwanted effects associated with the intervention, such as injuries. While variations between trials meant that we could not make specific recommendations, individual studies were often successful in demonstrating benefits to physical health from participating in different types of physical rehabilitation.
We evaluated nine randomised studies assessing the effects of whole grain diets compared to diets with refined grains or a usual diet on levels of cholesterol in the blood or blood pressure (major risk factors for cardiovascular disease including heart attacks or stroke). The evidence is current to August 2016. The diets were followed for at least 12 weeks, but most studies had some methodological limitations, numbers of participants were small, and the overall quality of the evidence was low. We found no studies reporting on the effect of whole grains on deaths from cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular events. All nine included studies reported the effects of whole grain diets on levels of cholesterol in the blood or blood pressure. We found no effects on blood cholesterol or blood pressure in favour of whole grain diets. Four studies were funded by independent national and government funding bodies, while the remaining studies reported funding or partial funding by organisations with commercial interests in cereals. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to date to recommend consumption of whole grain diets to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, or lower blood cholesterol, or blood pressure.
We searched the databases until October 2014. We included seven randomized controlled trials, with a total of 1624 participants, comparing dexmedetomidine versus traditional sedatives. All the studies required participants to have an anticipated need for sedation of more than 24 hours. The alternative sedatives included propofol, midazolam and lorazepam. We found no eligible studies in children or for clonidine. Of the seven studies, six were funded by the drug manufacturer, and one did not state any conflict of interest. Compared with traditional sedatives, dexmedetomidine reduced the breathing support time by approximately one-fifth, and the length of stay time in ICU by one-seventh. Dexmedetomidine was at least as effective as traditional sedatives for producing sedation and maintaining a light sedation level. There was no clear evidence in support of dexmedetomidine reducing the risk of delirium (a kind of acute confusion state), as results were consistent with both no effect and appreciable benefit. We had insufficient information to draw conclusions about reducing the risk of coma. Dexmedetomidine doubled the incidence of slow heartbeat, which was the most commonly reported adverse event. Our review provides no evidence that dexmedetomidine changed the overall death rate. The general quality of evidence ranged from very low to low, as most of the studies were at high risk of bias, serious inconsistency and imprecision, or strongly suspected publication bias.
All three included trials were randomised, but the blinding of intervention and outcome measurement varied. Data from two trials (enrolling 139 infants) were combined as they enrolled infants between 12 and 21 days of age, but data from one trial (enrolling 292 infants) were reported separately because researchers randomised infants aged less than 72 hours. The timing when the outcomes were measured varied among studies so it was not appropriate to combine some results. In one study all deaths that occurred were reported from the time babies were randomised not from when treatment started, hence there was a greater number of babies who died in that study.
One study received grant support and the industry provided Aerochambers and metered dose inhalers of budesonide and placebo for the same study. No conflict of interest was identified. Evidence from two studies in 370 infants, who were randomised between 12 and 21 days of age and who contributed data to the primary outcome of this review, showed that inhaled steroids administered after 7 days of age compared with systemic steroids did not decrease the incidence of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Evidence from the single study in which infants were randomised at less than 72 hours of age did not show difference the incidence of death or BPD.
Evidence from three studies in 431 infants contributing to secondary outcomes showed that inhaled steroids administered after seven days of age compared with systemic steroids did not significantly alter the incidence of BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen supplementation, length of hospital stay, intraventricular haemorrhage grade III-IV, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis, gastrointestinal bleed, retinopathy of prematurity stage > 3, culture-proven sepsis or the incidence of adverse effects.
Adverse event profiles did not differ for inhaled versus systemic steroids but some potential complications of steroid treatment have not been reported. More research is needed to show whether any form of routine use of steroids results in overall health improvements for babies at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Evidence quality (according to GRADE criteria) was moderate to low.
We included nine studies that compared the effectiveness of an intramuscular injection compared to corticosteroid tablets in patients presenting to an ED or similar acute care setting with acute asthma. The studies enrolled a total of 804 paediatric and adult participants. Most studies investigated the injectable corticosteroids dexamethasone or methylprednisolone compared to the corticosteroid tablets prednisone or methylprednisolone. Most studies did not report sources of funding (5 studies). Two studies received funding from general health research grants. One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company (Pfizer); however, reported that the company was not involved in any aspect of the study or manuscript preparation. One study reported being unfunded. Intramuscular injections of corticosteroids appear to be as effective as corticosteroids tablets in preventing relapse. We did not find any differences in the risk of relapse between participants receiving intramuscular injections and corticosteroid tablets. Although not all studies reported adverse effects in their study groups, we found no differences between participants receiving intramuscular injections and corticosteroid tablets. At follow-up, we found no differences in pulmonary function tests between participants who had received an intramuscular injection or corticosteroid tablets. In the studies that reported symptom scores and duration, we did not identify any differences between participants receiving corticosteroids by injection or by tablets. The quality of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of intramuscular injections of corticosteroids in improving health outcomes ranged from low to moderate. We had only moderate confidence about the estimated effects of intramuscular steroids on hospital admissions, improvement in respiratory function and relapse because of the risk of bias among included studies.
We included 16 randomised trials with data for 12,080 women. Some trials focused on physical checks of the mother and newborn, while others provided support for breastfeeding, and one included the provision of practical support with housework and childcare. They were carried out in both high-resource countries and low-resource settings where women receiving usual care may not have received additional postnatal care after early hospital discharge.
The trials focused on three broad types of comparisons: schedules involving more versus fewer postnatal home visits (five studies), schedules involving different models of care (three studies), and home versus facility postnatal check-ups (eight studies). In all but four of the included studies, postnatal care at home was delivered by healthcare professionals. For most of our outcomes, only one or two studies provided data. Overall, our results were inconsistent.
The evidence was very uncertain about whether home visits reduced newborn deaths or serious health problems with the mother. Women's physical and psychological health were not improved with more intensive schedules of home visits although more individualised care improved women's mental health in one study and maternal satisfaction was slightly better in two studies. Overall, babies may be less likely to have additional medical care if their mothers received more postnatal home visits. More home visits may have encouraged more women to exclusively breastfeed their babies and women to be more satisfied with their postnatal care. The different outcomes reported in different studies, how the outcomes were measured, and the considerable variation in the interventions and control conditions across studies were limitations of this review. The certainty of the evidence was generally found to be low or very low according to the GRADE criteria. Increasing the number of postnatal home visits may promote infant health and exclusive breastfeeding and more individualised care may improve outcomes for women. More research is needed before any particular schedule of postnatal care can be recommended.
We found only one trial. This trial has not been published in full and instead was presented as an abstract at a conference. Therefore we had only limited data from this trial to consider. The trial assessed the use of calcium channel blockers for pulmonary hypertension and did not reveal any improving effect on patient's exercise capacity (a primary outcome of this review) by calcium channel blocker.
We believe more research is needed, specifically RCTs should be done on this topic. This is because evidence from several non-randomized controlled studies suggest possible benefits, but we cannot be certain without RCTs.
We performed a search off all available literature on 8 August 2016 to find all randomised controlled studies. 28 studies including 6851 patients were included in this analysis. Five studies included children undergoing cardiac surgery. Adult studies included patients undergoing major vascular surgery (three studies), cardiac surgery (nine studies), coronary bypass surgery (10 studies) and partial kidney resection (one study). The overall quality of the studies was acceptable.
Twenty studies were funded without economical interest. One study was funded from a source with commercial interest. The other seven studies did not report funding.
Remote ischaemic preconditioning performed with a blood pressure cuff appears to be safe as only two of 15 studies reported adverse effects (6/1999 in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group and 1/1994 in the control group). However remote ischaemic preconditioning by vascular clamping may cause vascular complications. Kidney injury in patients undergoing (surgical) procedures in which kidney injury may occur, was not reduced by remote Ischaemic preconditioning measured at day one, two or three after surgery. The need for dialysis, hospital stay and death were not reduced by remote ischaemic preconditioning. Although remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation is safe, available data do not confirm the efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing kidney injury.
There have been surprisingly few investigations of treatments for SH in children and adolescents, despite the size of this problem in many countries. Providing therapeutic assessment may improve attendance at subsequent treatment sessions. Only one therapeutic approach - mentalisation - was associated with a reduction in frequency of repetition of SH. However this effect was only modest and the trial was small, which prevents us from being able to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of this treatment. There was no clear evidence of effectiveness for compliance enhancement, individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based psychotherapy, home-based family intervention, or provision of an emergency card, nor was there clear evidence for group therapy for adolescents with a history of multiple episodes of SH. Therapeutic assessment, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy warrant further investigation. While in a single small study, individual CBT-based psychotherapy appeared ineffective, further evaluation of this treatment is also desirable given the favourable results found in adults who SH. Given the extent of SH in children and adolescents, greater attention should be paid to the development and evaluation of specific therapies for this population.
In this systematic review of randomised controlled trials four studies were reviewed. Three studies involving 498 participants compared subcutaneous lignocaine, a short-acting local anaesthetic, with a control group (participants received either no pain relief or an inactive substance known as a placebo). Two studies involving 399 people compared intravenous opioids (fentanyl or morphine) and an anxiolytic (midazolam) with a control group. One study involving 60 people compared subcutaneous levobupivacaine, a long-acting local anaesthetic, with a control group. Intravenous pain regimens and subcutaneous levobupivacaine appear to reduce the pain experienced during femoral sheath removal. However, the size of the reduction was small. A significant reduction in pain was not experienced by participants who received subcutaneous lignocaine or who were in the control group. There were insufficient data to determine a correlation between pain relief administration and either adverse events or complications. Some patients may benefit from routine pain relief using levobupivacaine or intravenous pain regimens. Identifying who may potentially benefit from pain relief requires clinical judgement and consideration of patient preference. The mild level of pain generally experienced during this procedure should not influence the decision as some people can experience moderate levels of pain with the conventional wound care.
We included 11 studies in the review, with a total of 745 participants. Five studies (334 patients) compared the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre, three against other particle repositioning manoeuvres (Semont, Brandt-Daroff and Gans) and three with a control (no treatment, medication only, postural restriction). Patients were treated in hospital otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat) departments in eight studies and family practices in two studies. All patients were adults aged 18 to 90 years old, with a sex ratio of 1:1.5 male to female. For resolution of vertigo the Epley manoeuvre was significantly more effective than a sham manoeuvre or control. None of the trials that compared Epley versus other particle repositioning manoeuvres reported vertigo resolution as an outcome.
When studies looked at the conversion from a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test (a test to diagnose BPPV) in the patients, the results significantly favoured the Epley treatment group when compared to a sham manoeuvre or control. There was no difference when Epley was compared with the Semont or Gans manoeuvre. In one study a single Epley treatment was more effective than a week of three times daily Brandt-Daroff exercises.
Adverse effects were not often reported. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment. Rates of nausea during the repositioning manoeuvre varied from 16.7% to 32%. Some patients were unable to tolerate the manoeuvres because of cervical spine (neck) problems.
The review of trials found that the Epley manoeuvre is safe and effective in the short term. Other specific sequences of physical movements, the Semont and Gans manoeuvres, have similar results. There was a low risk of overall bias in the studies included. All trials were randomised, with five studies applying sealed envelope or external allocation techniques. Seven of the trials blinded the assessors to the patients' treatment group and data on all outcomes for all participants were reported in most studies. This evidence is up to date to January 2014.
The screening test used in these trials to detect colorectal (bowel) cancer was the faecal occult blood test (FOBT). If the FOBT is positive, the bowels are examined closely with further diagnostic test (coloscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast barium enema), but these tests often cause discomfort and can cause serious adverse consequences. As blood identified in faeces may be due to several reason (unrelated to cancer), it may cause people unnecessary stress and expose them to possible harm. This review found that FOBT screening is likely to avoid approximately 1 in 6 colorectal cancer deaths.
We identified two randomised controlled trials with 581 women requiring augmentation, each looking at different doses of oral misoprostol compared with oxytocin. One study gave 20 mcg doses of misoprostol every hour up to four hours, after which the dose was increased; the second gave women 75 mcg doses, repeated after four hours provided there were no adverse effects observed. Neither trial reported on the important safety outcomes of maternal or neonatal deaths, or severe maternal ill health.
One trial measured duration of labour from the start of augmentation, which was slightly shorter with intravenous oxytocin (5.20 hours compared with 5.22 hours). The number of vaginal deliveries within 12 and 24 hours, and caesarean section rates were similar. Neither trial reported clearly higher rates of uterine hyperstimulation with worrying fetal heart rate changes in the titrated oral misoprostol group. The rates of this outcome in the two studies varied greatly however. The evidence on uterine hyperstimulation without fetal heart rate changes was not consistent.
The number of women reporting nausea, vomiting, shivering and pyrexia was low with both misoprostol and oxytocin. Maternal satisfaction was not reported in either trial.
Important uncertainties still exist on the safety and acceptability of titrated oral misoprostol for labour dystocia, and further research is needed before it can be recommended as an alternative to oxytocin. However, in facilities that do not have access to electronic oxytocin infusion, lower doses of titrated misoprostol may be a better alternative to avoid hyperstimulation.
We found 62 relevant studies, of which 57 randomly allocated participants to receive either MT or a control therapy (randomised controlled trials) and five provided both therapies to all participants, but in random order (cross-over trials). The studies involved a total of 1982 participants with a mean age of 59 years (30 to 73 years) after stroke. Mirror therapy was provided three to seven times a week, between 15 and 60 minutes for each session for two to eight weeks (on average five times a week, 30 minutes a session for four weeks). At the end of treatment, mirror therapy moderately improved movement of the affected upper and lower limb and the ability to carry out daily activities for people within and also beyond six months after the stroke. Mirror therapy reduced pain after stroke, but mainly in people with a complex regional pain syndrome. We found no clear effect for visuospatial neglect. The beneficial effects on movement were maintained for six months, but not in all study groups. No adverse effects were reported. The studies provide moderately-reliable evidence that MT improves movement (motor function, motor impairment) and the performance of daily activities. However, there was only low reliability that MT decreases pain and visuospatial neglect. This may be due to the small number of studies. Further research is needed, with larger methodologically-sound studies.
This review looked at the effect of cutting down the proportion of energy from fat in our food on body weight and fatness in both adults and children who are not aiming to lose weight. The review found that cutting down on the proportion of fat in our food leads to a small but noticeable decrease in body weight, body mass index and waist circumference. This effect was found both in adults and children. The effect did not change over time.
We wanted to find out if antibiotics are an effective treatment for leptospirosis and if they have any unwanted side effects. We searched medical databases for trials that assessed the use of antibiotics for treatment of leptospirosis.
Trials could have compared antibiotics versus placebo (a pretend treatment) or no intervention; or versus another antibiotic. We found nine trials with 1019 participants, which took place in Barbados, Brazil, Malaysia, Panama, the Philippines, and Thailand. The participants were aged 13 to 92 years.
Participants resided in these areas except two trials which recruited military personnel. Four trials compared penicillin versus either placebo or no intervention. One trial compared penicillin versus doxycycline versus cefotaxime. One trial compared penicillin versus ceftriaxone. One trial compared penicillin versus chloramphenicol versus no intervention. One trial compared doxycycline versus azithromycin. One trial compared doxycycline versus placebo. We combined results from six trials. – May not reduce deaths (3 trials, 367 participants)
– May not reduce minor side effects (for example, diarrhoea (loose stools), nausea (feeling sick), and vomiting (being sick); 2 trials, 162 participants)
None of the included trials reported serious side effects. – May not decrease deaths (penicillin versus cephalosporin: 2 trials, 348 participants; penicillin versus doxycycline: 1 trial, 168 participants; cefotaxime versus doxycycline: 1 trial, 169 participants)
– May not affect the occurrence of serious side effects (penicillin versus doxycycline: 1 trial, 168 participants; penicillin versus cefotaxime: 1 trial, 175 participants; doxycycline versus cefotaxime: 1 trial, 175 participants)
– May not affect the occurrence of side effects considered non-serious (penicillin versus cefotaxime: 1 trial, 175 participants; penicillin versus doxycycline: 1 trial, 168 participants; penicillin versus chloramphenicol: 1 trial, 52 participants) We have low confidence in our results for death and side effects because of the small number of trials with widely varying results. Six trials included statements disclosing their funding/supporting sources and three trials did not mention funding sources. Four of the six trials mentioning funding sources received monies from public or governmental sources or from international charitable sources, and the remaining two trials, in addition to public or governmental sources, also received support in the form of trial medicines directly from pharmaceutical companies. This review updates the previous Cochrane review. The evidence is up to date to 27 March 2023.
We searched for evidence on 7 August 2016. We identified 15 Cochrane reviews that assessed interventions during pregnancy or childbirth that reported on cerebral palsy, with information from 27 randomised controlled trials involving 32,490 children. The reviews were all high quality, but the quality of the evidence about cerebral palsy ranged from very low to high.
The interventions assessed were for treating mild to moderate hypertension (two reviews), treating pre-eclampsia (two reviews), diagnosing or preventing fetal compromise (when the unborn baby may not be well) during labour (one review), preventing preterm birth (four reviews), maturing or protecting babies' lungs or brains before preterm birth (five reviews), and managing fetal compromise of preterm babies (one review).
We found high-quality evidence that one intervention was effective for cerebral palsy prevention: preterm children born to mothers who received magnesium sulphate before birth were less likely to develop cerebral palsy than children whose mothers received a placebo (five trials, 6145 children).
We found moderate-quality evidence that two interventions were probably ineffective, and could cause harm: (i) children born to mothers who had received antibiotics for preterm labour when their waters had not broken were more likely to develop cerebral palsy than children whose mothers did not receive antibiotics (one trial, 3173 children); and (ii) preterm children who were born immediately when there was suspected fetal compromise were more likely to develop cerebral palsy than those for whom birth was postponed (one trial, 507 children).
We found moderate-quality evidence that there was no clear difference in the chance of children to develop cerebral palsy whether their mothers received one or more courses of corticosteroids before preterm birth (four trials, 3800 children).
There was low-quality evidence as to whether the other interventions prevented, increased, or had no impact on cerebral palsy, although we did find that children born to mothers who received corticosteroids to help mature their lungs before preterm birth were potentially less likely to develop cerebral palsy than those born to mothers who received a placebo (five trials, 904 children). We identified one intervention that was effective in preventing cerebral palsy (magnesium sulphate before preterm birth), two that appeared to cause harm (preventive antibiotics for women in preterm labour when their waters have not broken, and immediate birth for preterm babies with suspected compromise), and one that did not appear to make a clear difference (more than one course of corticosteroids before preterm birth). For the other interventions assessed, there was not enough evidence to reach any conclusions. Further good quality randomised controlled trials, assessing interventions that might impact cerebral palsy risk factors, with long-term follow-up to measure cerebral palsy, are needed. We identified over 60 other Cochrane reviews that may provide more information in the future.
We identified one randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT) of the non-surgical treatment of 90 people with LM: 44 were treated with imiquimod cream plus tazarotene gel, and 46 were treated with imiquimod cream for 3 months; these interventions were followed by staged excision after 2 months. We did not find any RCTs of surgical treatments. Of those treated with imiquimod and tazarotene, 66% had a complete response at 5 months compared with 59% of those treated with imiquimod alone. The addition of tazarotene to imiquimod did not lead to a clinically better response, and the people in this group had higher inflammation. There were more dropouts due to adverse effects in this group. The quality of evidence is poor. With regard to the treatment of MIS, surgical interventions that aim to excise the tumour so that none of the tumour cells are in the margin are the most recommended interventions in non-selected cases. The evidence does not support the use of non-surgical interventions in selected cases (i.e., in elderly people with contraindications to surgical interventions). However, clinical centres may consider it where there is experience of this treatment and where close and adequate follow up can be undertaken.
With regard to the treatment of LM, surgical interventions remain the most recommended available treatment. The evidence does not support the use of non-surgical interventions, such as imiquimod, as a single therapy in non-selected cases. It may be considered only in selected cases and in clinical centres with experience. The evidence so far does not support the use of imiquimod as a neoadjuvant (i.e., before surgery) therapy but warrants further investigation, in order to evaluate if use after surgery can minimise recurrence and if use before surgery of large lesions or difficult sites can help to achieve smaller surgical excisions. The evidence does not support addition of tazarotene to imiquimod as neoadjuvant therapy.
Authors from Cochrane Oral Health reviewed existing studies to find all available evidence up to November 2014. We searched scientific databases for clinical trials testing the effects of fluoridated milk compared with non-fluoridated milk. Treatment had to be used and monitored for a minimum of two years. We found one unpublished study that included 180 three-year olds who were given either fluoridated or non-fluoridated milk at nursery schools in an area with high prevalence of dental cavities and a low level of fluoride in drinking water. After three years, 92% of the children were available for analysis. The evidence suggests fluoridated milk may be beneficial to schoolchildren, substantially reducing the formation of cavities in baby teeth. There was no information available about any possible adverse events. The evidence was considered to be low quality due to the lack of relevant studies, the risk of bias in the identified study and concerns over the applicability of the results to different settings and populations. Additional studies of high quality are needed before we can draw definitive conclusions about the benefits of milk fluoridation.
On 28 October 2015, we looked for clinical trials using sumatriptan plus naproxen to treat migraine headache in adults. People were given either a combination of sumatriptan and naproxen, sumatriptan only, naproxen only, or a placebo (dummy) treatment. They did not know which treatment they were taking, and nor did the health professionals looking after them. We found 13 studies, of which 12 (with about 9300 people) provided information on how well the combination treatment worked.
The combination of sumatriptan plus naproxen was better than placebo for relieving acute migraine attacks in adults. When the starting headache intensity was mild, 5 in 10 (50%) of people treated with the combination were pain-free at two hours compared with about 2 in 10 (18%) with placebo. Almost 6 in 10 (58%) people with moderate or severe pain who were treated with the combination had pain reduced to mild or none at two hours, compared with 3 in 10 (27%) with placebo. The combination was also better than the same dose of either drug given alone in these people. Results were 5 in 10 (52%) people with sumatriptan alone or about 4 in 10 (44%) with naproxen alone.
The combination was better than placebo or either drug alone for relief of other migraine symptoms (nausea, sensitivity to light or sound) and loss of ability to function normally. Adverse events of dizziness, tingling or burning of the skin, sleepiness (somnolence), nausea, indigestion (dyspepsia), dry mouth, and chest discomfort were more common with sumatriptan (alone or in combination) than with placebo or naproxen. They were generally of mild to moderate severity and rarely led to withdrawal from the studies. The studies were carried out to high standards and were generally large enough to give reliable results, so that most of the results for efficacy were of high quality. Results for adverse events were downgraded to moderate quality because there were fewer events.
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials database for clinical trials assessing methods (interventions) of improving nipple pain among breastfeeding women in September 2014. We also looked at healing and infection of nipples, length of breastfeeding, if infants only received breast milk, and if mothers were happy with treatment for nipple problems and breastfeeding in general. Interventions included drug treatments (against bacteria given by mouth, spray, ointment; against fungal infections), non-drug treatments (lanolin, petroleum jelly, peppermint oil, glycerine), dressings, nipple protectors (breast shields or shells), light treatment, or applying expressed breast milk. Interventions were compared with each other or usual care (control). We found four trials of good methodological quality involving 656 women, which evaluated five different interventions including glycerine pads, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, and an all-purpose nipple ointment. All studies included education to position the infant at the breast correctly as part of routine care to both intervention and control groups.
Currently, there is not enough evidence to recommend any specific type of treatment for painful nipples among breastfeeding women. These results suggest that applying nothing or expressed breast milk may be equally or more beneficial in the short-term experience of nipple pain than the application of an ointment such as lanolin. One important finding in this review was that regardless of the treatment used, for most women, nipple pain reduced to mild levels approximately seven to 10 days' after giving birth (postpartum). The quality of the evidence for this review did not allow robust conclusions regarding treating nipple pain. We found only four small trials and all four trials compared varying interventions, participants, what was measured, and standards of usual care. While the methodological quality of the included studies was good, the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain was of low quality, mainly due to single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis.
Until 1 April 2015, we ran computer searches for randomized trials of IUC inserted within 10 minutes of placenta (afterbirth) delivery. We wrote to researchers to find more studies. Trials could compare different times for insertion as well as types of IUC and ways to insert the device.
We found 15 trials. Seven recent studies compared IUC insertion right after childbirth versus early insertion (before hospital discharge) or later insertion (weeks after discharge). Four had full reports, although three were small studies. Insertion was as likely to occur when placed right after childbirth as when planned for later placement, except in a study from Uganda. For the four trials overall, the IUC came out more often on its own when placed right after childbirth than when inserted weeks later. Use at six months was more likely with insertion right after childbirth than weeks later. In single studies, the groups did not differ in use at 3 months or 12 months.
Eight older studies looked at types of IUC put in right after childbirth. Changing IUC design did not seem to affect whether IUC stayed in or whether it was used later on. Inserting IUC by hand or with a holding instrument did not seem to make a difference.
We found newer trials with full reports that compared placement times. The studies were of good quality. Ongoing trials will provide additional data, although some sample sizes are small. Larger studies would provide better information on whether the IUC came out on its own and on whether side effects occurred.
No trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of this drug in babies and only case reports are available. Future studies are needed.
This review examines the evidence from studies comparing different types of open surgery for people with groin hernia. We included only randomised studies comparing either 1) methods using synthetic mesh versus methods without mesh or 2) flat mesh methods versus plug and mesh methods. We divided mesh methods into flat mesh, plug and mesh or preperitoneal mesh and non-mesh methods into Shouldice or other non-mesh repair.
We found 20 studies comparing mesh with non-mesh repair and two studies comparing flat mesh with plug and mesh. For 13 studies we re-analysed data supplied by the study author, for four studies we received additional results from the study author and for five studies only published information was used.
There was strong evidence that fewer hernias recur after mesh repair than following non-mesh repair. There was a suggestion that people had less persisting pain after mesh repair but results were only available for nine out of 20 trials. Open mesh methods were shorter to perform than Shouldice procedures, but took longer than other types of non-mesh repair. We found no clear differences between mesh and non-mesh methods for operative complications and persisting numbness. Overall, people spent less time in hospital and returned to their usual activities quicker after mesh repair but this pattern was not observed for all studies.
We did not find clear evidence of differences between flat mesh repair and plug and mesh repair.
The included study provided very limited evidence that taxing foods with added sugar reduced their consumption by 4%. We are very uncertain about this evidence because the study did not use the strongest methods, looked at other kinds of taxation as well as taxing foods with added sugar, and may not have correctly classified food types. We are uncertain whether taxing foods with added sugar has an effect on reducing their consumption. The included study did not investigate the effects of taxing unprocessed sugar. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Studies should take place in countries that have implemented these taxes and should look at cost-effectiveness as well as the health benefits of taxing unprocessed sugar or foods with added sugar as a public health policy for preventing overweight, obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Countries that have implemented these taxes are Bermuda, Dominica, Hungary, India, Norway, the Navajo Nation (USA), and St. Vincent and Grenadines.
This review of trials compared CSE with traditional and with low-dose epidurals. There were 27 trials, involving 3274 women. The data showed no difference in the mothers' satisfaction between CSE and epidurals. However, CSEs had a slightly faster onset of effective pain relief, but more women itched than with low-dose epidurals. There was no difference seen for mobility in labour, headaches, caesarean section or adverse effects for the baby. Any differences for rare complications such as nerve injury and meningitis remain unknown. There appears to be little difference overall between these techniques.
We searched for studies which compared different vaccines or compared vaccination to placebo. We were able to include four studies with 179 people in the review. Most (143) were under 16 years old. No study compared one vaccine to placebo. There were a high number of drop outs in two of the studies. Vaccination does result in an immune system response to the types of influenza used in the vaccine. However, this response may not result in protection against influenza infection or lung damage. There were a high number of adverse events, but none were serious or persistent. There is no evidence to show if regular influenza vaccine benefits people with cystic fibrosis.
Only four randomised controlled trials with 271 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria for the review: two from Austria (outpatients), one from the USA (inpatients) and the fourth a multicentre, international study conducted in Austria, Canada and the USA. The trials continued for 15 to 18 weeks. Three compared methadone with buprenorphine (223 participants) and one compared methadone with oral slow-release morphine (48 participants). The National Institute on Drug Abuse funded two studies, one received a grant from the Mayor of Vienna, and in the fourth study Schering Plough provided an educational grant to the first author to employ personnel required to conduct this study. This review found few differences in newborn or maternal outcomes for pregnant, opiate-addicted women who were maintained on methadone, buprenorphine or oral slow-release morphine from a mean gestational age of 23 weeks to delivery.
Comparing methadone with buprenorphine, there is probably little or no difference in the number of women who dropped out of treatment. There may be little or no difference in the use of a primary substance and the number of newborns treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome between the methadone and buprenorphine groups. We are very uncertain whether newborns with mothers receiving buprenorphine could have a heavier birth weight.
Comparing methadone with oral slow-release morphine, there were no dropouts in the only study included. The use of heroin in the third trimester may be lower with slow-release morphine. However, there may be little or no difference in infant birth weight or duration of neonatal abstinence syndrome.
The number of participants in the trials was small and may not be sufficient to draw firm conclusions. All the included studies ended immediately after the baby was born. No severe complications were noted. In the comparison of methadone with buprenorphine, the quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low because of inconsistency in the results of the studies for some outcomes, high rates of participants who dropped out from the studies, and small sample sizes of the included studies. In the comparison of methadone with slow-release morphine, the quality of the evidence was low because of the small sample size of the study.
Using a systematic approach, the medical literature was searched thoroughly to find reliable studies that looked at the effects of improving patients' knowledge about asthma, but which did not attempt to improve practical self-management skills. The results of the studies were combined to see if patient education designed to improve patient knowledge about their condition made a difference to their asthma. Improving patient knowledge alone does not seem to reduce hospitalisations, doctor visits or medication use for asthma, but may play a role in improving patients perceptions of their symptoms. However, education programmes designed to improve knowledge alone may reduce Emergency Room visits in high-risk adults.
We included 24 trials with 1318 people with CF aged between one month and 56 years. Two thirds of the trials compared hypertonic saline to a placebo (a dummy treatment); the remaining trials compared hypertonic saline to another type of mucus clearing treatment (including mannitol; rhDNase (Pulmozyme®); amiloride; Mistabron®; xylitol); and one trial compared 7% hypertonic saline with 3% hypertonic saline. Trials assessed different concentrations of hypertonic saline with different nebulisers and different treatment schedules; the most common treatment was twice-daily 7% hypertonic saline and the most common nebuliser was ultrasonic. Most trials treated people with a bronchodilator to widen the airways before giving the hypertonic saline.  We are not sure whether hypertonic saline leads to an improvement in lung function in stable disease after four weeks. Two trials showed that there may be a small improvement in lung function (measured using the lung clearance index) with hypertonic saline compared to placebo in preschool children. We are also unsure whether hypertonic saline makes a difference to clearing mucus from the lungs, exacerbations or side effects compared to placebo.
During exacerbations, we found that there may be little or no difference in lung function after hypertonic saline compared to placebo. The trials did not report any serious side effects and there were no deaths.
One study compared 7% hypertonic saline with a lower concentration of hypertonic saline (3%); we are uncertain whether the higher concentration improved lung function. Three trials compared hypertonic saline with rhDNase and found that rhDNase may lead to an improvement in lung function compared to hypertonic saline after three months. We are unsure whether there is any difference in side effects.
One trial compared hypertonic saline to amiloride and a further trial compared hypertonic saline to sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulphonate (Mistabron®), but neither of the trials gave information about the effect of the treatments on lung function.
Similarly, a trial comparing hypertonic saline with mannitol did not give information about the effects on lung function, but they did report that there was no difference between treatments in clearing mucus from the lungs. People taking mannitol said it was more irritating than hypertonic saline.
Two trials compared hypertonic saline with xylitol, but we are unsure if there is any difference in lung function and none of our other outcomes were measured. We are not confident in the evidence from these trials. There is a high risk that people knew which treatment they were receiving in half the trials as they could taste the difference between the solutions.
Other factors that made us unsure of the results were the small numbers of people taking part in the trials combined with a wide variation in results; also, some trials limited participants to those who could tolerate hypertonic saline or to certain age groups. The evidence is current to 25 April 2022.
The choice of abdominal surgical incision is determined largely by access. However, a transverse incision may be superior to a midline incision in terms of recovery and complications. All randomised controlled trials comparing these incisions were identified. Outcomes included analgesic use, pulmonary function, complication rates and hospital stay. Marked variability in methodology made comparison difficult and potential biases in all of the studies suggests results should be treated with caution. Nevertheless a trend was seen toward less analgesic requirement, less effect on pulmonary function and lower wound dehiscence and incisional hernia rates with a transverse incision. However, the lower pain and reduced effect on pulmonary function were not translated into other clinical advantages as recovery times and other complication rates (except cosmetic appearance) were similar.
We included trials that involved both types of participants. The review found all randomised controlled evaluations of the effects of CBT on men's physical violence to their female partners worldwide, but there were only six small trials with a total of 2343 participants that met the inclusion criteria. The results of four of these trials, which compared men who received CBT with men getting no treatment, were combined. This was not able to show us whether or not CBT was better than no treatment. Similarly, the individual results of the other two trials, which compared CBT with another treatment, were inconclusive. Overall, the evidence from the included studies is insufficient to draw any conclusions.
The benefits and harms of manual therapy and exercise for adults with tennis elbow. We searched for studies of manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both, compared with placebo or minimal treatment (e.g. advice). We also included studies that compared manual therapy and prescribed exercises with either intervention alone, with or without glucocorticoid (steroid) injection. We extracted data on pain, disability, quality of life, treatment success and adverse events, and assessed how confident we were in the results. We found 23 studies involving 1612 participants. The average age ranged from 38 to 52 years and 47% of participants were female.
• 1 study (23 participants) compared manual therapy to placebo manual therapy.
• 12 studies (1124 participants) compared manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both, to minimal treatment.
• 6 trials (228 participants) compared manual therapy and prescribed exercises to prescribed exercises alone.
• 1 trial (60 participants) compared the addition of manual therapy to prescribed exercises and glucocorticoid injection.
• 4 trials (177 participants) compared manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both, and glucocorticoid injection to a glucocorticoid injection alone. Manual therapy compared with placebo manual therapy:
Pain was measured on a 0- to 10-point scale (lower scores mean less pain) at the end of treatment. 
• People who had manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both, rated their pain as 2 points.
• People who had placebo manual therapy rated their pain as 4.1 points.
Disability was measured on a 0- to 100-point scale (lower scores mean less disability) at the end of treatment. 
• People who had manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both, rated their disability as 15 points.
• People who had placebo manual therapy rated their disability as 40 points.
No other outcomes were measured, and no outcomes were collected after the end of treatment.
Manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both, compared with minimal treatment:
Pain was measured on a 0- to 10-point scale (lower scores mean less pain) at the end of treatment. 
• People who had manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both, rated their pain as 4.6 points.
• People who had minimal treatment rated their pain as 5.1 points.
Disability was measured on a 0- to 100-point scale (lower scores mean less disability) at the end of treatment. 
• People who had manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both, rated their disability as 58.8 points.
• People who had minimal treatment rated their disability as 63.8 points.
Quality of life was measured on a 0- to 100-point scale (higher scores indicate better quality of life) at the end of treatment. 
• People who had manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both, rated their quality of life as 67.5 points.
• People who had minimal treatment rated their quality of life as 73.0 points.
Treatment success was rated by participants at the end of the treatment.
• 571 out of 1000 people reported treatment success with manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both.
• 420 out of 1000 people reported treatment success with minimal treatment.
Participant withdrawals were measured at the end of the study. 
• 126 out of 1000 people receiving manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both, withdrew from studies.
• 147 out of 1000 people receiving minimal treatment withdrew from studies.
Adverse events were measured after treatment.
• 313 out of 1000 people reported adverse events with manual therapy, prescribed exercises, or both.
• 85 out of 1000 people reported adverse events with minimal treatment.
No serious adverse events were reported. For most findings, we have low confidence due to the small number of participants or events. Manual therapy and prescribed exercises may reduce pain and disability slightly in people with tennis elbow, with little or no benefit for quality of life and treatment success. Effects may not be sustained. We are less confident of the risk of adverse events or withdrawals from treatment because of the small number of events. The evidence is up-to-date to 31 January 2024.
We aimed to find and describe evidence on the unplanned effects of school measures implemented to help contain the spread of COVID-19. We searched for studies that looked at side effects of school measures. We grouped the side effects into the following categories.
Physical and mental health and well-being   Health and social care services   Human rights   Acceptability of measures   Unfair differences in health outcomes   Civil life, social interactions, and education   Money and resources   The environment
Physical and mental health and well-being
Health and social care services
Human rights
Acceptability of measures
Unfair differences in health outcomes
Civil life, social interactions, and education
Money and resources
The environment
We summarised the available information on school measures and their side effects. We included 60 studies from 25 countries. Regarding study design, 31 used numbers and statistics, 17 used text and descriptions, and 12 used both numbers and descriptions. Most studies looked at measures for staff (11 studies) or students (26 studies), or measures aimed at both staff and students or the whole school (20 studies). Only three studies looked at measures for parents or caregivers.
The studies investigated the following measures in schools.
Individual protection (26 studies); for example, wearing masks   Changes to the physical environment (20 studies); for example, improving ventilation   Rules about social interactions (25 studies); for example, mixing online and in-person teaching    Changes to services (1 study); for example, cancelling extracurricular activities   Rules about movement (3 studies); for example, staying in class at break time   Surveillance measures (9 studies); for example, testing students and teachers   Response measures (7 studies); for example, isolating people with COVID-19
Individual protection (26 studies); for example, wearing masks
Changes to the physical environment (20 studies); for example, improving ventilation
Rules about social interactions (25 studies); for example, mixing online and in-person teaching
Changes to services (1 study); for example, cancelling extracurricular activities
Rules about movement (3 studies); for example, staying in class at break time
Surveillance measures (9 studies); for example, testing students and teachers
Response measures (7 studies); for example, isolating people with COVID-19
Nine studies looked at the joint effects of more than one measure (for example, joint effects of wearing masks and improving ventilation).
Most studies focused on the following unplanned effects.
The influence of school measures on health and well-being (29 studies)   Whether school measures were acceptable or easy to carry out (31 studies)   How school measures affected social interactions, school organisation, and education (23 studies)
The influence of school measures on health and well-being (29 studies)
Whether school measures were acceptable or easy to carry out (31 studies)
How school measures affected social interactions, school organisation, and education (23 studies)
Other unplanned effects included the following.
Changes to unfair differences in health outcomes (2 studies)   Effects on money and resources (7 studies)   Effects on the environment (1 study)
Changes to unfair differences in health outcomes (2 studies)
Effects on money and resources (7 studies)
Effects on the environment (1 study) Most of the studies in the review looked at the influence of school measures on health and well-being; social interactions, school organisation, and education; and whether measures were acceptable and easy to carry out.
The most common school measures were wearing masks, cleaning and disinfecting rooms and surfaces, mixing online and in-person learning, and ensuring physical distancing. Many studies also looked at combinations of several measures. This review identified the gaps, where more research is needed.
We need more studies to look at a wider variety of unplanned effects. We also need more studies looking at the unplanned effects of other school measures, such as testing and response measures.
Future studies should look at long-term effects, too. We need more information about how these measures work in different types of schools and in different countries. This would help people make decisions about when and how to use different school measures. The evidence is current to January 2023.
Large high quality trials are needed that directly compare muscle relaxants to analgesics or NSAIDs and future studies should focus on reducing the incidence and severity of side effects.
Eleven scientific studies were analysed to derive the best available evidence. The majority of the studies included newborn babies born after 32 weeks' gestation. The main outcomes assessed were drug levels in the blood and kidney functions. The search was updated to 29 April 2016. Safer and potentially more effective levels of the drug were maintained using a 'one dose per day' treatment schedule. No differences in the risk of adverse effects on the kidney function or hearing were noted between two regimens. The quality was evidence was considered as moderate because the sample size was relatively small and two of the studies were scientifically less robust.
People who are treated with haemodialysis at home may experience increased well-being and might live longer. However, home haemodialysis may also increase the burden of healthcare for patients and families and increase technical problems for patients. We searched for randomised and non-randomised studies comparing home haemodialysis with hemodialysis treatment performed in a hospital or clinical setting. We compared and summarised the trials' results and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as trial methods and size. We found only one randomised study (where patients are randomly allocated to one treatment or the other) that compared home haemodialysis with in-centre haemodialysis in nine patients. All other studies (39) were observational (where the treatment was not randomly assigned).
Home haemodialysis may be associated with outcomes including increased length of life, fewer hospital stays, higher chance of receiving a kidney transplant, shorter recovery time from dialysis itself and increased control of blood pressure. Patients receiving home haemodialysis tended to have more dialysis (more hours or more often). Some of the differences in outcomes for patients may have been due to factors that were not related to dialysis treatment since patients receiving home haemodialysis were younger and had fewer other illnesses. The small number and size of the studies were limitations in this review. Not all the studies provided data about the outcomes we were interested in, and we are unsure about the results. The evidence is up to date as of October 2022.
Overall, evidence was low- or very low-quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. Limited evidence suggests that stopping long-term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low.
We found 98 studies from 15 countries. Of the 88 core studies, 37 asked advocates about their views and experiences and seven asked abused women about advocacy (two of these also asked staff). The other 44 core studies helped us understand the way advocacy works and how effective it is. We included 10 additional studies that did not fit the original criteria but added useful information, as befitting a realist approach. Of these, three were randomised controlled trials (RCTs; a type of experiment in which participants are randomly allocated to two or more interventions), one was an intervention process evaluation, one was a qualitative (e.g. focus groups, interviews) study, two studies used mixed methods (a combination of qualitative and quantitative research) to explore women's experiences, two were surveys of women, and one was a mixed methods study of women and staff. We were unable to obtain the full texts of two studies that we thought might be core and three further relevant studies are still ongoing.
Advocacy interventions varied considerably in duration, participating staff (e.g. nurses, psychologists, social workers), and setting (e.g. healthcare settings, domestic violence refuges or shelters).
In the studies, women and advocates agreed that the following were all important parts of advocacy: education and information on abuse and on women's rights and sources of help (resources); active referral to, and help in accessing other services; assessment of risk of repeat abuse; and safety planning to avoid it. Trust in the advocate is important and more likely when the advocate and the woman share an ethnic background or the advocate was also abused. Advocates must help women consider their best options, depending on things like ethnicity, immigration status, where they live, the severity and type of the abuse experienced and finances. There are trade-offs when making decisions to reduce the abuse and women's safety was not necessarily at greatest risk from staying with the abuser. Advocacy could potentially have some benefits for abused women, if undertaken for long enough, but its goals need to match each woman's needs. It may take months to have an effect. Two studies (one involving the police and one in an antenatal clinic) found that where abuse is severe to start with, some interventions may possibly prompt the abuser to increase the abuse. Advocates want to help women and can get stressed if they do not feel helpful enough, so they need support from organisations and other advocates, including repeat training, debriefs, and funding to do their job well. Our confidence in the key findings varied between moderate and high. However, some themes (the effect on outcomes of women being physically dependent on their abuser, being pregnant or having children) were less well supported by evidence and further, good-quality research is needed to confirm findings. Researchers should be careful when choosing how to measure abuse so that measures have more meaning for advocates and abused women, thus increasing the usefulness of future reviews. Further evidence from studies where participants are followed up for years would be helpful. More economic analyses are needed to establish if current advocacy interventions are the best way of spending money for abused women.
We found 21 RCTs involving more than 6300 people with Alzheimer’s disease. Four trials of two different medicines (methylphenidate and modafinil) had been done specifically to study apathy, so all the people taking part were known to be significantly apathetic before the trial started. The other 17 trials had other primary aims, but reported some data on apathy. The trials were generally well designed and conducted. From the three trials with methylphenidate, we found that it may improve apathy, although this depended on how the apathy was measured. The people taking methylphenidate also did slightly better than those taking placebo on scales measuring cognition (thinking, remembering, etc.) and some daily activities, but it was not clear that these effects were big enough to be important in practice. We found no evidence that it caused more side effects than placebo. The quality of this evidence was low or moderate, so we cannot be certain that other similar studies would not have different results. There was only one very small trial with modafinil and there was no evidence that it was effective for apathy. The other 17 trials studied a variety of medicines and included people who were not necessarily significantly apathetic to start with. We therefore thought they were only indirectly relevant to our review question. It is also highly likely that other trials of the same drugs have measured apathy but have not published the results, so we were concerned about possible publication bias (that the studies we found could have been a biased subset). We therefore thought the quality of evidence for all these other medicines was low or very low, meaning that we can have limited or little confidence in the results. Current evidence suggests that methylphenidate may be useful for treating apathy in Alzheimer's disease. However, more trials should be done specifically targeting apathy in order to improve the overall quality of the evidence.
We searched the scientific literature for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs published up to July 2015. RCTs are studies in which people are randomly allocated to treatment groups. Quasi-RCTs are studies in which people receive treatment based on methods that are not strictly random such as date of birth, or their hospital record number, and the results of quasi-RCTs are generally considered less trustworthy than those of RCTs.
We found 24 trials (22 RCTs and two quasi-RCTs) to include in our review. These studies included, in total, information from 3161 parents and their young children. Eight studies had been carried out in the USA, five in the UK, four in Canada, five in Australia, one in Mexico, and one in Peru.
All of the studies looked at behavioural, cognitive-behavioural or videotape modelling parenting programmes. Behavioural programmes are aimed at helping parents develop methods that will reduce bad behaviour, usually with the use of techniques such as praise or rewards. It also aims to help parents set limits that make sense. Cognitive-behavioral skills allow parents think about behaviour patterns and focus on solutions. Programmes can use a variety of techniques; for example, videotape modelling programmes enable parents to learn by watching videotaped films of other parents implementing some of the techniques described above. Some of the studies we found included people chosen specially because they were ‘at risk’ of behavioural problems, while others included parents and children without any specific risks. When we put all of the studies together, overall, we found that group-based parenting programmes can improve the emotional and behavioural development of young children, although the quality of the evidence was, on the whole, low. Furthermore, our findings were not convincing when we removed two studies that used quasi-randomised methods.
Our findings also showed evidence of an improvement in externalising problems (these might include negative behaviours in children or young people that are directed towards the external environment such as anger, aggression or conflict with the law). However, the evidence for this, once again, came from studies that we rated as being of only moderate quality, and was only found for some parts of the outcome measure (known as a subscale).
Results from single studies that could not be combined with other studies and that were of poor quality, on the whole, showed no impact on children’s internalising problems (e.g. depression and anxiety). However, there was some improvement on one subscale of a measure that focused on children’s hyperactivity-inattention and another subscale that focused on social skills.
There was moderate-quality evidence that group-based parenting programmes also improve the way in which parents and children interact, as measured by fewer negative behaviours.
Our reasons for rating the quality of the evidence as low or moderate included: inconsistency in the findings from different studies (different studies yielded different results); unclear risk of bias (where it was not possible for us to assess the ways in which the included studies might be biased due to inadequate information); and small numbers of parents in the included studies.
We believe more research is needed to be able to reach a firm conclusion about whether the effects we have found are short term only or whether they continue over time and therefore may be able to prevent future behavioural problems.
We wanted to find out whether using CPAP in preterm babies might reduce apnoea or the need for a more invasive form of treatment such as mechanical ventilation, i.e. using a machine to do the breathing for the baby. We also wanted to know whether any particular method of applying CPAP was more effective. We searched for studies that included preterm babies where the researchers thought CPAP was necessary for apnoea of prematurity. We included studies that compared CPAP with supportive care (such as stimulation, oxygen, or both) or studies that compared different types of CPAP. We did not find any studies that compared CPAP with supportive care. We found four small studies, involving 138 babies. They compared two different forms of CPAP. There were three comparisons with only one study in each comparison and one study did not provide any useful data. The duration of CPAP in the four studies was between 4 and 48 hours. From these four studies, we do not know whether there is any difference between different forms of CPAP. This is because each comparison had only one study, the results were very imprecise because the studies were small, and the care given by the healthcare workers might have been influenced by their awareness of which treatment the baby was receiving. The evidence is up-to-date to 6 September 2022.
Cinnamon bark has been shown in a number of animal studies to improve blood sugar levels, though its effect in humans is not too clear. Hence, the review authors set out to determine the effect of oral cinnamon extract on blood sugar and other outcomes. The authors identified 10 randomised controlled trials, which involved 577 participants with diabetes mellitus. Cinnamon was administered in tablet or capsule form, at a mean dose of 2 g daily, for four to 16 weeks. Generally, studies were not well conducted and lacked in quality.
The review authors found cinnamon to be no more effective than placebo, another active medication or no treatment in reducing glucose levels and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a long-term measurement of glucose control. None of the trials looked at health-related quality of life, morbidity, death from any cause or costs. Adverse reactions to cinnamon treatment were generally mild and infrequent.
Further trials investigating long-term benefits and risks of the use of cinnamon for diabetes mellitus are required. Rigorous study design, quality reporting of study methods, and consideration of important outcomes such as health-related quality of life and diabetes complications, are key areas in need of attention.
Results from this Review should be interpreted with caution because of some concerns about risk of bias (potential for systematic error) in five out of six trials. Only one trial had low risk of bias. Additional high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to fully assess the effects of exercise-based CR interventions.
We found six randomised trials (trials in which each infant had an equal chance of being chosen to receive either treatment), involving 204 preterm infants. The search is up to date to August 2019. Low-quality evidence showed that the addition of extra protein to breast milk increased short-term rates of weight gain (five trials), length gain (four trials), and head growth (four trials). Low-quality evidence from one trial did not show a clear difference in the rate of growth of skin fold thickness (measure of fat under the skin) between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups. Very low-quality evidence from one trial reported that infants who received additional protein stayed in hospital longer, while very low-quality evidence from four trials observed higher blood urea nitrogen concentrations (measure of kidney function and protein breakdown) in these infants, compared to those who received no additional protein. Very low-quality evidence from one trial suggested that adding extra protein to expressed breast milk did not clearly increase the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (inflammation of the intestine) or feeding intolerance, or clearly alter serum albumin concentrations (a measure of blood protein levels). No data were available on the effects of adding extra protein to human milk on long-term growth, body fat, obesity, high blood sugar, or brain development. Adding extra protein to human milk for preterm infants may increase short-term growth. However, its effect on length of hospital stay, feeding intolerance, and necrotizing enterocolitis is uncertain, due to data limitations and very low-quality evidence. There were no data about effects on later health and development, or effects in low resource settings.
Since protein supplementation of human milk is now usually done as a component of multi-nutrient fortifiers, future studies should compare different amounts of protein in multi-component fortifiers, and be designed to determine the effects on length of hospital stay, safety, long-term growth, body fat, obesity, high blood sugar, and brain development.
In the absence of studies eligible for inclusion in the review it was not possible to assess the quality of the evidence.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of exercise-based rehabilitation programmes compared with no exercise, or a different type or intensity of exercise, in people aged 18 years or over, who were heart transplant recipients. We included 10 trials that studied 300 people who were heart transplant recipients. Nine studies compared exercise with no exercise; one study compared high-intensity interval training with continuous moderate-intensity exercise.
We found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation led to an increase in the exercise capacity of heart transplant recipients compared to not undertaking exercise. There was evidence of better exercise capacity following high-intensity interval training compared to continuous moderate-intensity exercise. Four studies reported health-related quality of life, but there was no evidence of differences between exercise training and no exercise training in most (18/21) aspects reported, or between high- and moderate-intensity exercise.
One adverse event was reported in one study.
Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed as low or unclear; lack of reporting made assessment for more than half of included studies challenging. Six (of 10) trials reported sources of funding. None reported funding from agencies with commercial interests in the results. Poor reporting or few participants in the analyses led to evidence quality being judged as moderate for both exercise capacity and health-related quality of life. Evidence suggested that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves exercise capacity, and that exercise has no impact on health-related quality of life in the short-term (median 12 weeks follow-up), in heart transplant recipients whose health is stable. Further research is needed to establish long-term impacts of exercise-based rehabilitation on important aspects such as risk of death and hospital admission.
No evidence from randomised controlled trials was found and more research is needed.
We included eight randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 894 participants. The studies looked at the preventive and therapeutic effects of periodontal treatment on changes in blood pressure, with the participants diagnosed with periodontitis of any age and gender with or without hypertension. Four studies compared periodontal treatment with no treatment in blood pressure changes in people with periodontitis diagnosed with or without other cardiovascular diseases except hypertension. The results showed no difference in blood pressure between the treated and untreated participants for any length of time.
Three studies compared periodontal treatment with supra-gingival scaling (by just removing the visible dental calculus with limited treatment effects on periodontitis) in people with chronic periodontitis. The results showed no difference in blood pressure for any length of time.
Only one study on people with hypertension found a reduction in blood pressure between groups in the short term, with no difference in blood pressure changes for the other comparisons. It was not well documented how the included studies were conducted and described, therefore the quality of evidence was low. Consequently, there was insufficient information to draw firm conclusions.
Evidence is up-to-date as of August 2019. We identified two randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of adding HMF early for preterm infants. We found only limited data from two trials. There is uncertainty as to whether adding HMF early for preterm infants has an effect on important outcomes such as growth during hospital stay, necrotising enterocolitis, death before discharge, presence of growth failure at discharge, and length of hospital stay. The available evidence is insufficient to support or refute early addition of HMF to human milk to promote growth in preterm infants. More trials are needed to examine whether adding HMF early is beneficial or harmful for preterm infants.
We found that venous PTA did not provide benefit on disability, physical or cognitive functions, relapses, or quality of life. No serious adverse events attributable to venography or venous PTA occurred. Venous PTA has proven to be a safe but ineffective intervention and cannot be recommended in patients with MS. All trials that were ongoing were either terminated or withdrawn, so this updated review is conclusive. No further randomised clinical studies are needed. This review is up to date to August 2018.
The authors reviewed the results of all randomized trials that compared an aldose reductase inhibitor with a control and lasted at least six months. Many of the 32 randomized controlled trials identified had significant methodological flaws. The trials used a variety of measures to look for a benefit of treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors. The authors elected to focus primarily on changes in muscle strength and sensation. These were chosen because they are thought be the best indicator of the severity of polyneuropathy, and they have been used in a previous landmark study of the effects of intensive blood sugar control on diabetic neuropathy, as well as in studies of treatments in other types of polyneuropathy. Muscle strength or sensation were assessed in 29 trials, but sufficient data for analysis was only available in 13 studies, involving 879 treated participants and 906 controls. There was no overall significant difference between the treated and control groups. For one drug, tolrestat, there was possibly some benefit, but concerns about liver toxicity have lead to withdrawal of tolrestat from use in humans. A few trials did report that symptoms of neuropathy improved for the treated group, but this was contradicted by most other trials. No benefit was detected on electromyography (EMG) parameters (27 studies) or foot ulceration (one study). Quality of life was not assessed in any of the studies. Adverse effects were infrequent and were mostly minor, except for severe allergic reactions with sorbinil, impaired kidney function with zenarestat, and alteration of liver function with tolrestat. The authors concluded that there was no significant benefit of treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors for diabetic polyneuropathy.
Exercise was proposed to improve glycaemic control in pregnant women with diabetes. Four small trials involving 114 pregnant women evaluated this intervention. None included pregnant women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. There is insufficient evidence to recommend, or advise against, diabetic pregnant women enrolling in exercise programs. Further trials, with larger sample size, are needed.
Eleven studies evaluated interventions aiming to improve the management of osteoporosis by GPs. Five of these studies were sufficiently similar that we were able to combine their results. Our findings suggest that alerting the GP that a patient is at risk of osteoporosis and educating the patient, reminding them to visit their GP, leads to improved GP behaviour (diagnostic testing and medication prescribing). We determined that the quality or certainty of the evidence from these studies is high, so we are confident in these results. GP alerting on its own is also probably effective according to two studies and adding the patient-directed component probably does not lead to a greater effect.
Of the ten studies on low back pain, seven showed that GP education and distribution of guidelines may lead to little or no improvement with regards to GPs' clinical behaviour. Two studies showed that providing GPs with guidelines and information on the total number of tests they request may have an effect on GP behaviour (resulting in a slight reduction in the number of tests). One study showed that using a combination of guidelines and GP reminders attached to test reports may result in a small but sustained reduction in the number of tests.
Of the four studies on osteoarthritis, one found that GP behaviour may improve when prominent GPs are recruited to educate their colleagues. A second study showed slight improvements in patient outcomes (pain control) after training GPs on pain management.
Of the three studies on shoulder pain, one study showed that there may be little or no improvement in patient outcomes (functional capacity) after GP education on shoulder pain and injection training.
Of the two studies on other musculoskeletal conditions, one study on pain management showed worse patient outcomes (pain control) after GP training on the use of tools to measure pain.
The 12 remaining studies across all musculoskeletal conditions showed little or no improvement in GP behaviour and patient outcomes. The majority of the studies did not investigate the potential adverse effects of the interventions and only three studies included a cost-effectiveness analysis.
The direction of the targeted behaviour (i.e. increasing or decreasing a behaviour) does not seem to affect the effectiveness of an intervention.
The certainty of the evidence was high from studies that examined the effectiveness of interventions to improve the management of osteoporosis by GPs, so we are confident in these findings. There were important limitations in how most of the remaining studies were conducted or reported, and we are less certain of the likely effects of these interventions to improve the management of musculoskeletal conditions.
We wanted to find out:
- whether there was evidence that treatments other than medication might help to improve the symptoms of PPPD;
- whether these treatments might cause any harm. We searched for studies that compared different types of treatment (excluding medications) to either no treatment or placebo (dummy) treatment. We found one small study that looked at the use of transcranial direct current stimulation for PPPD. This treatment involves applying a weak electrical current to the brain, through small electrodes that are placed on the surface of the scalp. People in the study were given a device to use at home to carry out this treatment five times per week, for a period of three weeks.
The study did assess potential harms of the treatment, and also looked at how the treatment affected dizziness-related quality of life. However, as it was such a small study, it is unclear whether this treatment has any effect on the symptoms of PPPD, or whether there are any risks associated with treatment. Further research is needed to identify whether any treatments are useful for PPPD and whether they might be associated with any harms. The evidence is up-to-date to November 2022.
This evidence is current to May 2014. We identified five randomised controlled trials (1296 participants under two years of age) comparing montelukast (a leukotriene inhibitor) with placebo in infants and young children hospitalised with bronchiolitis. Our primary outcomes were length of hospital stay and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included clinical severity score, percentage of symptom-free days, percentage of children requiring ventilation, recurrent wheezing, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and clinical adverse effects.
The effects of montelukast on length of hospital stay and clinical severity score were uncertain due to considerable heterogeneity (differences) between the study results and wide confidence intervals around the estimated effects. Data on symptom-free days and incidence of recurrent wheezing were from single studies only and individual analyses of these studies did not show significant differences between the intervention group and the control group. One study of 952 children reported two deaths in the leukotriene inhibitors group: neither was determined to be drug-related. No data were available on the percentage of children requiring ventilation, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. Finally, three studies reported adverse events including diarrhoea, wheezing shortly after administration and rash. No differences were reported between the study groups. We assessed the quality of the evidence for length of hospital stay and clinical severity score as low due to inconsistency and imprecision arising from small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals, which did not rule out no effect or harm. Overall, the current evidence does not allow definitive conclusions to be made about the effect and safety of leukotriene inhibitors in infants and young children with bronchiolitis.
To date, data obtained from one well-designed randomised clinical trial suggest that inserting a cervical pessary is superior to expectant management in the prevention of preterm birth in 385 women between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy. Neonatal paediatric care admission was reduced in the pessary group in comparison to the expectant group. These women had a singleton pregnancy and high risk of preterm birth because of the short length of the neck of the womb (cervix). Among the pessary group, 27 women needed pessary repositioning without removal and there was one case of pessary removal. Results of both the randomised trial and non-randomised trials show that pessary users complained of increased vaginal discharge. More studies are needed in different settings, with singleton and multiple pregnancies where the weakness of the cervix is from other causes, to confirm the results of the single trial included in this review. Some studies are ongoing.
We wanted to determine the accuracy of ultrasound in confirming gastric tube placement and assess its potential to replace X-rays as the standard method. We analyzed 22 studies with 1939 participants looking at the accuracy of ultrasound for confirming gastric tube placement. Most studies showed that ultrasound performed well in confirming correct tube placement, but there were limited data on incorrect tube placements and potential complications as only 152 participants in the studies had a misplaced tube.
The studies used three ultrasound methods: neck approach, upper abdominal approach, and a combination of both.
Ultrasound alone was not sufficient for confirming proper placement for feeding tubes but, when combined with other tests, it could be useful for confirming gastric drainage tubes. Many studies had poor or unclear methods, so our confidence in the evidence was reduced.
Only eight of the 22 studies were considered representative of people who usually need a gastric tube.
Results varied for incorrect tube placement. Larger studies are needed to determine if ultrasound can replace X-rays for confirming gastric tube placement and whether it can help reduce complications from misplaced tubes. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2023.
We searched for all high-quality published studies evaluating the effectiveness of magnesium to prevent muscle cramps and found five studies in older adults, five studies in pregnant women, and one study in people with liver cirrhosis. The studies in older adults included 271 participants (61.6 to 69.3 years of age) and the studies in pregnant women included 408 participants. The single study in people with liver cirrhosis enrolled only 29 people, not all of whom experienced cramping. There were no studies of people who cramp while exercising. Magnesium was compared to placebo in nine of 11 studies, and compared to calcium, vitamin E, vitamins B₁ and B₆, and no treatment, in two studies of pregnant women. The included studies ranged from 14 to 56 days of treatment. Magnesium was given orally in 10 of 11 studies, and by four-hour intravenous infusion on five consecutive days in one study. Funding for included studies came from a manufacturer of magnesium tablets in two studies, independent sources in three studies, and was not reported in six studies. The combined results of five seemingly reliable studies suggest, with moderate-certainty, that magnesium is unlikely to reduce the frequency or severity of muscle cramps in older adults. In contrast, the five studies in pregnant women had important limitations to their reliability (both in study design and reporting of results), did not consistently show benefit, and could not be combined. As a result we are very uncertain as to whether pregnant women experiencing muscle cramps would benefit from magnesium. The single study in people with liver cirrhosis reported no difference in cramp frequency or intensity but was too small for conclusions to be drawn.
More research on magnesium in pregnant women is needed. The same is true for those who suffer cramps associated with medical conditions, or while exercising. However older adult cramp sufferers appear unlikely to benefit from this therapy. Major side effects were infrequent and participants withdrew from the study at similar rates when given magnesium or placebo. However minor side effects, mostly diarrhoea (as would be expected from magnesium salts) and nausea, were common and affected roughly 11% (10% in control) to 37% (14% in control) of participants.
The review is up to date to September 2019.
The evidence is current to 11 October 2019. We included studies that randomly assigned adults to intervention groups comparing the two techniques described above. We found six studies including a total of 562 participants. Five studies involved abdominal surgery, and one involved orthopaedic surgery. No studies involved emergency surgery nor patients suffering from serious medical conditions before surgery. The number of deaths was slightly lower in the GDFT group compared with the RFT group, but this may be due to chance. No difference in the frequency of major complications was observed between the two groups. In addition, no differences were observed between RFT and GDFT groups in the following outcomes: length of hospital stay, surgery-related complications (related directly to the operation site, e.g. problems with wound healing), non-surgery-related complications (related to problems with other organs, e.g. heart or lungs), renal failure, and quality of surgical recovery. We judged the certainty of evidence obtained for this review as very low because conclusions are based on very small numbers of participants in included studies, the quality of included studies is low, and studies were performed only on selected groups of patients that did not reflect the real population of people undergoing surgery. This means that new studies are very likely to change the results of this review. The review does not answer the question of whether results would be the same for adults who have other serious health problems before surgery, or for adults undergoing other types of surgery besides abdominal surgery and orthopaedic surgery.
Cabergoline has been compared with the older agonist bromocriptine in five studies including 1071 patients. Only one of the smaller studies was medium term (36 weeks), the others all being short term (12 -15 weeks). The time patients spent in the immobile off state was reduced with both agonists but slightly more by cabergoline compared with bromocriptine. This small advantage of cabergoline did not reach statistical significance. Dyskinesia reported as a side effect was significantly increased with cabergoline compared with bromocriptine. Physical impairment and disability were measured in four of the studies but no statistically significant advantage for cabergoline was found. The number of patients rated as much or very much improved on a clinician's global impression scale was similar with both agonists. Levodopa dose reduction was no different between cabergoline and bromocriptine. There was significantly more confusion with cabergoline. Otherwise, dopaminergic side effects were comparable with these agonists and no significant difference in the withdrawal rate from the trials was found.
Cabergoline produces similar benefits to bromocriptine in off time reduction, physical impairment and disability ratings, and levodopa dose reduction over the first three months of therapy. The frequency of side effects and withdrawals from treatment were similar with the two agonists apart from increased dyskinesia and confusion with cabergoline.
A total of 34 randomised studies, involving 4001 children were identified and underwent data extraction and analysis. The most frequent comparisons were for long-term, low-dose antibiotics with no treatment (8 studies) or placebo (4 studies) and antibiotics versus surgical reimplantation of ureters plus antibiotics (7 studies). Other treatments looked at endoscopic correction by injection compared with antibiotics (3 studies), different materials for endoscopic correction (2 studies) circumcision (1 study), probiotics (1 study), cranberry product (1 study), and oxybutynin (2 studies).
Meta-analysis of similar studies found that long-term low-dose antibiotic treatment compared with no treatment may lead to little or no difference in the risk for repeat UTIs in children with VUR. Associated side effects were infrequent and minor, but prophylaxis was associated with a threefold increased risk of bacterial resistance to the treatment drug in later infections. Surgery decreased the number of repeat UTIs with fever, but did not change the number of children developing UTI with illness or kidney damage. Many studies did not contribute to the meta-analysis as they failed to report relevant outcomes or were single studies examining a treatment option not used by other studies or combinations of treatments. Long-term low-dose antibiotic treatment in children with VUR makes little or no difference to the risk of repeat UTI causing a person to be unwell. Surgery may reduce the risk of repeat UTI with fever however this is based on two studies of 429 children who may not represent the majority and may not bear true in a more general group of children with VUR. Complementary therapies such as probiotics and cranberry were trialled in single or two studies and do not provide evidence of sufficient certainty to support or deny their use.
we reviewed all clinical trials in preterm babies that gave corticosteroids systemically, that is, either as an injection or as a medicine, starting from the first seven days of age, and provided data on rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia later in the newborn period. We included 23 studies (1817 infants). Search is up-to-date as of 25 September 2020. this review indicates that giving systemic corticosteroids to babies starting at seven days or later after birth reduce the risks of death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, without increasing rates of cerebral palsy (a disorder affecting movement ability) in later childhood. However, the longer-term outcomes have not been well studied. It seems wise to limit late use of systemic corticosteroids to babies who cannot be weaned from mechanical ventilation, and to minimise the dose and duration of any course of treatment.
Results for two ongoing studies are awaited. overall the certainty of evidence supporting our conclusions for major outcomes is high.
The review assessed whether routine use of antibiotics at the time of an episiotomy prevented infection for women with an uncomplicated vaginal birth, compared with either placebo, or no antibiotics. We searched for evidence (24 July 2017) from randomised controlled trials in the medical literature. We only identified one small trial that was conducted in a public hospital in Brazil and provided very low-quality data from 73 women. The trial showed no clear difference between the groups, with or without antibiotics, of the number of women who experienced infection or breakdown of the episiotomy wound. No women developed infection of the lining of the uterus in either group. The trial did not report on any other outcomes of interest for this review. The current evidence on the impact of prophylactic antibiotics for prevention of infection after episiotomy is from one small trial with design limitations. The relatively low incidence of episiotomy infection, when infection control measures are well observed, raises questions about the potential added benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis, particularly when balanced against the risk of antibiotic-related side effects for the mother, and her baby, and in terms of emerging antibiotic resistance. There is a need for a careful and rigorous assessment of the comparative benefits and harms of prophylactic antibiotics on infection morbidity after episiotomy, in well-designed randomised controlled trials, using common antibiotics and regimens in current obstetric practice.
The evidence from randomised trials is as follows.
1. It is uncertain whether daily oral prednisone (an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid) improved weakness and sensation (numbness) compared to no treatment, as the evidence is of very low quality. We know that corticosteroids have a significant risk of serious side effects during prolonged use.
2. High-dose monthly oral dexamethasone (a more powerful corticosteroid) for six months was probably no more or less effective than daily oral prednisolone.
3. Plasma exchange probably produced significantly more short-term improvement in disability than dummy exchange. In the largest observational study, 3.9% of plasma exchange procedures had complications.
4. IVIg produced significantly more short-term improvement in disability than placebo. Adverse events were more common with IVIg than placebo but serious adverse events were probably no more common than with placebo. Other, lower-quality studies, not eligible for inclusion here, report that serious adverse effects can occur with IVIg.
5. There was no clear difference in short-term improvement of impairment with plasma exchange as compared to IVIg.
6. There was probably little or no difference in short-term improvement of disability with IVIg in comparison to oral prednisolone and there was little or no difference in comparison to intravenous methylprednisolone. Corticosteroids are much more widely available than IVIg, and are cheaper and easier to use.
7. It is uncertain whether low-dose azathioprine added to prednisone improved impairment over prednisone alone, because the quality of evidence is very low. Adverse events were not reported but observational studies show that side effects prevent 10% of people from continuing treatment.
8. Methotrexate may have no benefit over placebo in number of participants able to reduce their corticosteroid or IVIg dose by 20%. Serious adverse events were probably no more common with methotrexate than with placebo. We know from other types of study that methotrexate has serious side-effects, including damage to fetuses, liver function abnormalities and scarring of the lung.
9. Interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a), compared to placebo, probably does not allow more people to withdraw from IVIg. Serious adverse events were probably no more common with IFN beta-1a than with placebo in the two studies of this intervention.
10. There have been no other completed trials of medicines that suppress or change immune responses or that treat fatigue or pain in CIDP.
We need further research on predictors of response to different treatments, on long-term benefits, and of cost-effectiveness. We need more RCTs of medicines that suppress or change immune responses and treat symptoms of pain and fatigue in CIDP, and better ways to collect information on adverse events.
This review is up to date to October 2016.
We found five studies involving a total of 146 people with CVI that directly compared the effects of physical exercise with controls that did not include a structured physical exercise programme. The studies looked at possible changes in signs and symptoms of CVI; blood flow (measured by ejection fraction (the amount of blood the heart pumps each time it beats) and venous refilling index); quality of life; exercise capacity; muscle strength; and ankle joint mobility. Not all the studies reported on all of these outcomes, and the outcomes were measured in different ways. Most results came from small, single studies. None of the studies reported on new cases of venous leg ulcers or if surgical treatment was needed to relieve symptoms. Although some studies reported improvements in some outcomes after an eight-week period and a six-month period in the exercise group compared to the control group, we are uncertain if these equal real differences due to concerns about how the studies were designed and because the results were from small, single studies. The evidence is current to 28 March 2022.
In several clinical studies it was found that the respons of these tumours to radiotherapy was improved by adding hyperthermia. Hyperthermia is a type of cancer treatment in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures (i.e. around 42 to 43 degrees Celcius during one hour) to damage and kill cancer cells.. This temperature is in itself able to kill tumour cells under certain conditions and also increases the lethal effect of radiation on tumour cells. can However, the results observed with this treatment were not consistent in subsequent clinical studies. Therefore we analysed the results of all clinical studies published so far comparing the treatment results of radiotherapy alone with the results of combined radiotherapy and hyperthermia in patients with locally advanced cervix carcinoma. The results do suggest a better outcome for patients treated with the combination of radiotherapy with hyperthermia. Thus following treatment a complete disappearance of the tumour was observed more regularly, regrowth of the tumour at the site of origin during follow up was observed less frequently and more patients were still alive at last follow-up. Treatment related side effects were not increased by the addition of hyperthermia to standard radiotherapy. However, the number of patients included in the clinical studies analysed is limited as the majority of patients had stage IIIB disease. The authors therefore conclude that hyperthermia may provide a clinically relevant improvement in treatment outcome for patients with locally advanced cervix carcinoma, in particular patients with stage IIIB disease. Additional clinical data are needed to warrant its use for all patients with locally advanced cervix carcinoma.
Data from one quasi-randomised trial with 88 infants from 75 families were included in the review. Infants in the early discharge programme with home gavage feeds had a mean hospital stay that was approximately nine days shorter than that of infants in the control group. Infants in the early discharge programme also had lower risk of clinical infection during the home gavage period compared with infants in the control group during the corresponding time in hospital. No significant differences were observed between groups in duration and extent of breast feeding, weight gain, re-admission within the first 12 months post discharge from the home gavage programme or from hospital, scores reflecting parental satisfaction or health service use. Evidence is needed regarding the effects of early home discharge for preterm babies who are stable but still need gavage (tube) feeds.
However, most systematic reviews of antidepressant treatment have included trials conducted in secondary care settings. There has been doubt about the effectiveness of antidepressants in primary care, and hence the impetus to do this review. Through extensive searches of the literature we found 14 studies conducted in adults (not the elderly) in primary care setting, in which tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were compared against a placebo control group in the treatment of depression. The results showed that both TCAs and SSRIs were effective for depression. Most of the studies were supported by funds from pharmaceutical companies and were of short duration. There appeared to be more adverse effects with TCAs than with SSRIs, however rates of withdrawal from study medication due to adverse effects were very similar between the two antidepressant classes. Adverse effects not leading to medication cessation seemed to be more common with TCAs than SSRIs.
The review authors searched the medical literature and found four randomised controlled trials. No new studies were included in this update. Application of pressure (compression) with a mechanical device for some 30 minutes caused clotting of the blood in the pseudoaneurysm in three-quarters of people (38 people aged between 40 and 85 years) within 24 hours. It made no difference if the probe was placed blindly or using ultrasound. A further study of 168 people found that compression caused clotting of the pseudoaneurysm in more than 90% of people at 24 hours; again, using ultrasound did not seem to make any difference. Injection of bovine thrombin appeared to be more effective that ultrasound-guided compression (in two studies, including 68 patients in total). There are, however, concerns about allergy to the thrombin and introduction of infectious agents, thought to be responsible for transmission of some degenerative diseases, as well as the possibility of causing a blood clot in the artery. No complications were reported in these studies apart from one deep vein thrombosis in the people treated with compression.
Six trials showed a statistically significant improvement in global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales in PDD and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (CIND-PD) patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors. There was no current disaggregated evidence to support their use in CIND-PD. In a single trial, no statistically significant improvement was observed in patients with DLB who were treated with cholinesterase inhibitors and further trials are necessary to clarify the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors in this patient group.
This review focuses on the effectiveness of carbamazepine for people with schizophrenia. A search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register was carried out July 2012. Ten studies were found with 283 people. Carbamazepine was compared with no active medication (‘dummy’ or placebo treatment), versus an antipsychotic or when taken in addition to an antipsychotic. However, all of the 10 studies were small and information in them was of a poor standard. There is therefore a lack of evidence whether carbamazepine reduces symptoms and side effects in people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems. Larger well-designed trials are necessary to provide stronger evidence before carbamazepine can be recommended as a treatment for people with schizophrenia.

In September 2016 we searched for as many relevant studies as we could find that had a reliable design (randomised controlled trials) and had compared PMM treatments with other treatments for venous leg ulcers. We found 12 studies involving a total of 784 people. Ten studies gave results we could use and all treatments were dressings. All these studies gave all the participants compression therapy as well as the dressings. Most of the people in the trials had wounds that were not getting better or had been there a long time. Findings from four trials are unclear as to whether there is a benefit of PMM dressings on venous ulcer healing compared with other dressings. Five trials reported on wound side effects and their results are unclear as to whether there is a difference in rates of side effects between PMM dressings and other dressings. It is also unclear whether PMM dressings result in decreases in the amount of saline used and the time taken during dressing changes, and whether there is an effect on total costs. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low: most studies we found were small and could have been better conducted, so it was difficult to be sure how meaningful the results were. The next step would be to do more research of better quality to see whether PMM dressings do heal venous ulcers more quickly than other dressings.
This plain language summary is up to date as of September 2016.
We reviewed eight trials involving 5762 participants that compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet agents for preventing recurrent stroke and found no benefit of low intensity anticoagulation over aspirin, and an increased risk of bleeding with high intensity anticoagulation.
Our search strategy was up to date as of March 2013. We found four trials looking at four different types of tools to help improve the amount of tumour that is removed. The tumour that they looked at was usually high grade glioma but one study also included patients with low grade glioma. Imaging interventions used during surgery included magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) during surgery to assess the amount of remaining tumour, or a fluorescent dye (5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)) to mark out the tumour. Two trials used pre-operative imaging to map out the location of a tumour, which was then used at the time of surgery to guide the resection (neuronavigation). All the studies were at significant risk of bias and some were small and stopped early. Others were funded by the manufacturers of the image guidance tool involved. We found low quality evidence that using image guided surgery can lead to more of the tumour being removed surgically in some people. It has not been proven that any of the techniques that were evaluated improve overall survival. Data about how each technique can affect a patient's quality of life was poorly reported. The side effects of each technique were also poorly reported, but they did not appear to be more common with image guided surgery. There is a concern that taking out more of the tumour using 5-ALA can lead to patients having a type of stroke early after surgery but long-term the risk seems to be no different between techniques. There was very low quality evidence for neuronavigation and no trials were identified for ultrasound guidance. Evidence for image guided surgery in removing brain tumours is sparse and of low quality. Further research is needed to assess two main questions.
1. Is removing more of the tumour better for the patient in the long-term?
2. What are the risks of making a patient symptomatically worse by taking out more of the tumour, and how may this affect a patient's quality of life?
The review found insufficient good quality evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine if unit-dose packaging of drugs saves lives, but there is some indication that it might improve treatment adherence. More research is needed.
This review found that sclerotherapy was better than surgery in terms of treatment success, complication rate and cost at one year, but surgery was better after five years. However, the evidence was not of very good quality and more research is needed.
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed the certainty of the evidence. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we rated the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. We found 15 published studies that included 908 people with persistent pain due to a variety of causes including nerve disease, chronic low back pain, chronic neck pain and complex regional pain syndrome. All of these studies evaluated SCS; no studies evaluated DRGS.
Eight studies (that included 205 people) compared SCS with a sham (placebo) stimulation, where the electrodes were implanted, but no stimulation was delivered. Six studies that included 684 people compared SCS added with either medical management or physical therapy with medical management or physical therapy on its own. We rated the evidence as being of low, or very low certainty. Limitations in how the studies were conducted and reported, the amount of evidence we found and inconsistency between studies in some instances means that our confidence in the results is limited.
The evidence suggests the following.
Compared to receiving medical management or physical therapy alone, people treated with the addition of SCS may experience less pain and higher quality of life after one month or six months of stimulation. There is limited evidence to draw conclusions in the long term of one year or more. It is unclear whether SCS reduces disability or medication use.
Compared to a sham (placebo) stimulation, SCS may result in small reductions in pain intensity in the short term that may not be clinically important, but this is currently unclear. There is no evidence at medium or long-term follow-up points.
SCS can result in complications. These include movement or malfunction of the electrode wires, wound infections and the need for further surgical procedures to fix issues with the implanted devices. We also found instances of serious complications that included one death, nerve damage, lasting muscle weakness, lung injury, serious infection, prolonged hospital stay and the extrusion of a stimulation device through the skin.
Very limited evidence around the costs and economics of SCS suggested that SCS increases the costs of healthcare. It was not clear whether SCS was cost-effective. SCS may reduce pain intensity in people with chronic pain. It is currently not clear how much of this effect is due to the SCS itself and how much is due to so-called "placebo" effects, which are the result of the experience of undergoing the procedure and the person's expectations that it will help them. Receiving SCS does present a risk of relatively common complications and less common serious complications. We are currently unsure of the precise degree of this risk. The evidence in this review is current to September 2021.
Results from this Cochrane review indicate that AL-TENS helps decrease pain and joint tenderness compared to a placebo. No benefit was found on grip pain. More people who received conventional TENS reported a decrease in their disease activity than those who received acupuncture-like TENS.
This is an update of a previous review that included studies on migraine and tension-type headache. The original review has been split into two separate reviews: this update addresses only studies on tension-type headache, while a second focuses on migraine. When we updated this review (November 2014), we identified two new studies. Six studies were already included in the previous version of the review. Overall, we analysed a total of 412 adults participants. All the studies had a small number of participants and were conducted over a period of two to four months. Only a few were of high quality.
Results suggest that SSRIs or SNRIs are no better than placebo (sugar pill) in reducing the number of days with tension-type headache. There were no differences in minor side effects between participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs versus those treated with placebo. SSRIs and SNRIs do not seem to offer advantages when compared to other active treatments, specifically the tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline. The participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs suffered fewer minor side effects than those who took amitriptyline, however the number of people who stopped taking one drug or the other due to side effects was approximately equal. These results are based on poor quality, small, short-term trials (no more than four months). We did not find a study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with other medications (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non-drug therapies (e.g. psycho-behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture).
We wanted to find out if:
– one type of exercise was better than another;
– higher exercise dose was better than lower exercise dose;
– more-intensive supervision was better than less-intensive supervision of exercise. We looked for studies that compared one type of exercise versus another, higher versus lower exercise dose, or more-intensive versus less-intensive supervision. The studies included women with urinary incontinence, but not women with conditions of the nervous system or women who were pregnant or had recently given birth.
We compared and summarised the study results, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We were most interested in women's quality of life after treatment. We found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. The biggest study included 362 women and the smallest 11 women. While the studies were conducted in countries around the world, most were from middle- to high-income countries (meaning that women had reasonable access to good health care). Most studies lasted three months. Three studies had funding or non-monetary support from a commercial company. We were mainly interested in women's quality of life. This was measured using questionnaires about how often the incontinence happened, how much urine leaked, and how much it affected or limited the women.
1. Type of exercise
– Combined training (e.g. using bridging exercises at the same time as pelvic floor muscle contraction) may be slightly better than pelvic floor muscle training alone.
– Pelvic floor muscle training may be better than indirect training (exercises that do not include contractions of the pelvic floor muscles).
- Pelvic floor muscle training combined with indirect training may make little to no difference compared to pelvic floor muscle training alone.
2. Exercise dose
– There was not enough evidence to comment on dose.
3. More-intensive versus less-intensive supervision
– There is probably little or no difference between one-to-one supervision and group classes.
– Delivering training instructions via technology (e.g. internet, mobile phone app) may be slightly better than leaflets.
– There was not enough evidence to comment on other methods of training delivery. We are confident that there is little to no difference between one-to-one supervision and group classes. We are less confident that combining indirect training with pelvic floor muscle training compared to pelvic floor muscle training only makes little to no difference, and delivering pelvic floor muscle training instructions via technology is slightly better than the leaflets, or that pelvic floor muscle training is better than indirect training.
Our confidence in the evidence for other comparisons of approaches to these exercises is low to very low, and the results of further research could differ from the results of this review.
We were unsure about the evidence as study methods were not well described, not all the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in or they did not report it in a way we could use, results were inconsistent across different studies, and many studies were very small. This evidence is up to date to 27 September 2023.
Only three small trials were found that compared these two options and these did not find convincing evidence to support routine use of one route rather than the other.
This updated review assessed whether there were harmful or beneficial effects from participating in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The outcomes of patients who participated in RCTs were compared with outcomes of patients who were eligible for the trial and received similar clinical interventions, but did not participate. Comparisons were included both of 'experimental' treatment inside and outside of RCT and of 'control' treatment comparisons. On average, the outcomes of patients participating and not participating in RCTs were similar, suggesting that participation in RCTs, independent of the effects of the clinical interventions being compared, is likely to be comparable.
In the short term treatment of people with rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate:
- improves pain, function and other symptoms;
- probably reduces joint damage as seen on the x-ray.
Precise information about side effects and complications was not always available. Common side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, stomach pain, and sores on lips, mouth or throat. Rare complications may include birth defects, kidney, lung and liver problems. When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints making your joints swollen, stiff and painful.
Treatments aim to decrease symptoms and improve your ability to move.
Methotrexate is one of a group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and it is the most common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate helps prevent further permanent damage that can happen if rheumatoid arthritis is not treated.  - 15 more people out of 100 experienced major improvement in the symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis after 12 months with methotrexate when compared to placebo (15% absolute improvement).- 23 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone experienced major improvement.- 8 people out of 100 who took a placebo experienced major improvement. In people who took either placebo or methotrexate, none had absence of active disease. - People who took methotrexate rated their disability to be 0.27 points lower on a scale of 0 to 3 after 3 to 12 months with methotrexate when compared to placebo (9% absolute improvement).
- People who took methotrexate rated their disability to be between 0.39 and 1.04.
- People who took placebo rated their disability to be between 0.53 and 1.34. - 12 more people out of 100 perceived their ability to perform physical activities at least 20% better after 12 months with methotrexate alone compared to placebo (12% absolute improvement).
- 39 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone perceived their ability to perform physical activities at least 20% better.
- 27 people out of 100 who took a placebo perceived their ability to perform physical activities at least 20% better. - 5 more people out of 100 perceived their mental well-being better after 12 months with methotrexate alone compared to placebo (5% absolute improvement).
- 26 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone perceived their mental well-being better.
- 21 people out of 100 who took a placebo perceived their mental well-being better. - 8 more people out of 100 had less x-ray damage to joints measured by increase in erosion scores of more than 3 units on a scale ranging from 0 to 448 in people who took methotrexate compared to placebo after 12 months (8% absolute reduction).- 4 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone had increased damage to joints measured by x-ray.-12 people out of 100 who took a placebo had increase damage to joints measured by x-ray. - 9 more people out of 100 discontinued methotrexate due to adverse events after 3 to 12 months compared to placebo (9% absolute withdrawals).- 16 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone discontinued methotrexate due to adverse events.- 8 people out of 100 who took a placebo discontinued placebo due to adverse events. - 1 more person out of 100 experienced serious side effects after 3 to 12 months with methotrexate alone compared to placebo (1% absolute harm).- 3 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone experienced serious side effects.- 2 people out of 100 who took a placebo experienced serious side effects.
We included a total of three trials involving 209 participants who were treated with oral zinc pills or placebo. All patients were adults over 18 years who had subjective tinnitus. All three studies investigated improvement in tinnitus as their primary outcome. One study assessed adverse effects and our secondary outcome 'change in overall severity of tinnitus'. Two studies assessed tinnitus loudness. Only one study, which enrolled only elderly patients, used a validated instrument (the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ)) to measure the primary outcome. The other two studies measured tinnitus using scales (from 0 to 7 and from 0 to 10), but these scales were not validated instruments for studying tinnitus. All three included studies had differences in their participant selection, length of follow-up and outcome measurement, which prevented a meta-analysis (combining of results).
Only one trial (conducted in 2013) used a validated instrument (the THQ) to measure improvement in tinnitus, our primary outcome. The authors reported no significant difference between the groups. Another study (2003) reported the severity of tinnitus using a non-validated scale (0 to 7) and found a significant difference in the subjective tinnitus scores, which favoured the zinc group. However, this result may be biased because the losses were unbalanced and higher in the placebo group. A third study (1991) also evaluated improvement of tinnitus using a non-validated instrument (a scale of 0 to 10) and found no significant difference between groups.
There were no severe adverse effects associated with zinc. Three cases of mild adverse effects were reported in different participants (e.g. mild gastric symptoms).
Two studies (2003 and 2013) assessed change in tinnitus loudness (one of our secondary outcomes), but did not find a difference between patients treated with zinc compared to those who took a placebo.
Two studies assessed change in the overall severity of tinnitus. One study, published in 1991, did not find any difference for this outcome between the groups. The second study, published in 2003, reported a significant reduction in subjective tinnitus score in the zinc group and no difference in the placebo group. However, both studies used a non-validated scale. The quality of the evidence is very low. We found no evidence that the use of oral zinc supplementation improves symptoms in adults with tinnitus. This evidence is up to date to 14 July 2016.
We wanted to find out if PDE5i were better than a fake pill (placebo) to improve Raynaud's phenomenon. We also wanted to find out if PDE5i were associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared PDE5i with placebo in people with Raynaud's phenomenon. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found nine studies on a total of 411 people, mostly female. Most of the people in the studies had Raynaud's phenomenon in addition to systemic sclerosis. Study duration ranged from four to eight weeks. Studies were conducted in India, Germany, and Brazil.
We found that:
- people who took a PDE5i experienced three fewer attacks in a week (21) than those who took placebo (24).
- the average duration of Raynaud's phenomenon attacks was five minutes shorter with PDE5i compared to placebo (50 versus 55 minutes).
- we are uncertain whether PDE5i reduces the severity of an attack
- there may be little to no difference in the amount of pain in people who took PDE5i compared to those who took a placebo (2.9 compared to 3.0 points on a 0 to 10 scale which is a 1% improvement).
- people who took a PDE5i reported a 36% overall improvement in their disease compared to those taking a placebo.
- people who took a PDE5i probably have similar rates of serious unwanted events that cause harm compared to those taking a placebo (2% with PDE5i and 4% with placebo).
- people who took a PDE5i are probably more likely to stop treatment early (range of 4% to 20% in different studies) compared to those taking a placebo (2%). We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and results varied widely. This evidence is up to date to June 2022.
Cochrane authors searched for clinical studies on 19 October 2017. We found five trials, including 612 women, that met the inclusion criteria. The studies took place in Egypt, the US, Japan and Italy. Only three of the included studies provided data in a format that could be analysed in this review.
Combined oral contraceptive pill versus placebo
We found two trials including 354 women that compared the COCP with a placebo (pretend treatment). The evidence was at high risk of bias. There was very low quality evidence that treatment with the COCP was associated with an improvement in self-reported dysmenorrhoea (period pain) at the end of treatment measure on a verbal rating scale (where the woman rates her pain as (for example) "no pain," "slight pain," "moderate pain," "severe pain" and "unbearable pain") and low quality evidence for an improvement in self-reported dysmenorrhoea pain at the end of treatment using a visual rating scale (where the woman marks her pain visually on a line) compared with placebo. There was very low quality evidence that there was a reduction in menstrual pain from the beginning to the end of treatment in the COCP group compared with women having a placebo.
Combined oral contraceptive pill versus other medical treatment
We found one trial of 50 women that compared the COCP with another medical treatment (goserelin).
The study was at high risk of bias. At the end of treatment, the women in the goserelin group were not having a period and therefore we could not compare the groups.
Six months after the end of treatment, there was very low quality evidence that there was no clear difference between women treated with the COCP and women treated with goserelin for self-reported dysmenorrhoea, using a visual rating scale or a verbal rating scale. Six months after the end of treatment, there was very low quality evidence that there was no clear evidence of a difference between the COCP and goserelin groups for reporting complete absence of pain, as measured by a visual rating scale and low quality evidence using a verbal rating scale. The quality of the evidence was very low quality. The main reasons for downgrading the evidence were because the data were based on a single small trial with wide variation in results and lack of details about how the study had been designed. There were some concerns with two of the studies that were funded by a pharmaceutical company that also had input into the design of the trial, data collection and the analysis of data. This means that we cannot be confident about the results.
This review is current to 31 January 2019 and includes only studies in which treatment was allocated randomly by type. All study participants had osteoarthritis or rotator cuff tear arthropathy of the shoulder and had tried non-surgical treatments already. The average age of study participants was between 63 and 81 years old. Slightly more than half of the participants were female. We found no studies comparing shoulder replacement surgery to any other type of treatment, including other types of non-replacement surgery, physiotherapy, or no treatment at all. We found five studies comparing one type of shoulder replacement to another type of shoulder replacement. We found 15 studies comparing one type of shoulder replacement technique to the same type, performed with a technical modification or a different prosthetic component. Eight out of 20 studies were funded by a shoulder replacement manufacturer. A further seven out of 20 studies were conducted by researchers who had other financial relationships with shoulder replacement manufacturers. Three trials (126 participants) met our inclusion criteria for our main comparison of conventional stemmed total shoulder replacement (TSR) versus stemmed humeral hemiarthroplasty (HA) for treatment of osteoarthritis. TSR may result in less pain and better function compared to HA at two-year follow-up, but this may not be noticeable. We are very uncertain whether there are any differences in the frequency of adverse events and further operations.
TSR resulted in 15% less pain (1% less to 29% less).
• People who had HA rated their pain as 2.8 points (0 to 10 scale).
• People who had TSR rated their pain as 1.29 points.
TSR resulted in 11% better function (2% better to 19% better).
• People who had HA rated their function as 72.8 points (0 to 100 scale).
• People who had TSR rated their function as 83.4 points.
TSR resulted in similar quality of life to HA (5% lower to 7% higher, 5 points lower to 7 points higher (0 to 100 scale)).
• People who had HA rated their quality of life as 57.4 points.
• People who had TSR rated their quality of life as 58.4 points.
TSR resulted in a similar number of adverse events (25% fewer to 21% more) and a similar number of further operations on the same shoulder (8% fewer to 15% more) compared to HA.
• Following HA, 286 per 1000 people experienced an adverse event and 103 per 1000 required further operations.
• Following TSR, 143 per 1000 people experienced an adverse event and 77 per 1000 required further operations. For the main comparison, the quality of evidence for assessing pain, function, and quality of life was low. For assessment of adverse events and further operations, the quality of evidence was very low. Across the other 12 comparisons, the quality of evidence was also very low.
This review is based on one randomised controlled trial (RCT) which included 30 participants and therefore the results are restricted to the analyses of a single study. This RCT compared two ablative techniques: carbon dioxide (CO2) laser surgery and cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspiration (CUSA). There was no evidence for differences in the risks of disease recurrence after one year follow up, pain, scarring, painful/uncomfortable urination (dysuria) or burning on urination, adhesions (fusion of the 'lips' or labia as part of the healing process by the formation of bridges of tissue), infection, abnormal discharge or the presence of dead tissue shedding from healthy skin (eschar) between women who received CO2 laser surgery and those who underwent CUSA. Due to the small number of participants with high-grade VIN included in the trial there was insufficient evidence to conclude that either surgical technique is superior over the other. This review highlights the need for further high-quality, well-designed trials.
We wanted to know how fertility-sparing surgical interventions affect the treatment success rate, time to remission, relapse, death from disease, death due to treatment, pregnancy rate, quality of life, number of cycles of chemotherapy, any adverse events, and emergency removal of the womb. We searched for studies that investigated the effectiveness of fertility-sparing surgical intervention compared to chemotherapy (comparison 1), or the combination of fertility-sparing surgical intervention and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (comparison 2), and whether surgical intervention caused any unwanted effects in women with LR-NMGTN. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the certainty of evidence. We found two studies that involved 62 people for comparison 1 and 89 people for comparison 2. The fertility-sparing surgical intervention used in both studies was uterine curettage, in which abnormal cells are scraped from the lining of the womb using a spoon-like instrument. For comparison 1, the one study that evaluated fertility-sparing surgical intervention versus chemotherapy did not report the outcomes of interest: treatment success rate, relapse, death from disease, death due to treatment, pregnancy rate, or quality of life, or any adverse events (i.e. unwanted or harmful effects).
Comparison 2 was evaluated in one study. We are very uncertain if uterine curettage followed by chemotherapy has an effect on treatment success rate, relapse, death from disease, death due to treatment, pregnancy rate, or any adverse events, when compared to chemotherapy alone. Quality of life was not reported in the study. We are very uncertain about the benefits and harms of fertility-sparing surgical intervention in LR-NMGTN. We are not confident in the evidence for three main reasons. Firstly, the design of the included studies puts them at high risk of bias. Secondly, there was only one study for each comparison, and they each had a small number of participants. Finally, there were gaps in the information about the outcomes we think are most important for evaluating fertility-sparing surgery with or without chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for LR-NMGTN. We searched for evidence up to 31 January 2024.
We searched for relevant trials up to December 2013. The studies brought together trial data from all over the world with 26 trials (34 trial comparisons) and 8447 patients in the first meta-analysis (surgery versus surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy); and 12 trials (13 trial comparisons) and 2660 patients in the second meta-analysis (surgery plus radiotherapy versus surgery plus radiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy). Trials were carried out between 1979 and 2003. Results found that people with non-small cell lung cancer that had surgery followed by chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy), lived longer than those who had surgery without chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy).

After five years, 64 out of every 100 patients who were given chemotherapy after surgery were alive compared to 60 patients out of every 100 who just had surgery. For those who also received radiotherapy, after five years, 33 out of every 100 patients who received chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy were alive compared to 29 out of every 100 patients who received surgery and radiotherapy.
Quality of life information was not routinely collected during the trials, but where toxicity was assessed and mentioned in the publications, it was thought to be manageable.

In both studies, there was little variation in the effect of chemotherapy according to the type of chemotherapy given, other trial characteristics, or by the type of patient included in the trial. These systematic reviews and meta-analyses use individual participant data, which is considered the gold standard of this type of review. We included all eligible trials if possible, no matter what language they were published in or whether they were published or not.  The first meta-analysis (surgery versus surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy) included 92% of all patients in eligible trials and the second meta-analysis (surgery plus radiotherapy versus surgery plus radiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy) included 86% of all patients in eligible trials.
We are confident that further research is unlikely to change the findings. The studies were well designed and conducted, address the review question, and the effects are consistent across trials. The impact of any data we have not been able to include in our analyses is small.
Sixty-one studies presented data on 15,077 women with a wide range of risk factors for developing breast cancer, who underwent RRM. Risk-reducing mastectomy could include either surgically removing both breasts to prevent breast cancer (bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy or BRRM), or removing the disease-free breast in women who have had breast cancer in one breast to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in the other breast (contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy or CRRM). The evidence is current to July 2016. The BRRM studies reported that it reduced the incidence of breast cancer or the number of deaths or both, but many of the studies have methodological limitations. After BRRM, most women are satisfied with their decision, but reported less satisfaction with cosmetic results, body image, and sexual feelings. One of the complications of RRM was the need for additional unanticipated surgeries, particularly in women undergoing reconstruction after RRM. However, most women also experienced reduced worry of developing and dying from breast cancer along with diminished satisfaction with body image and sexual feelings
In women who have had cancer in one breast, removing the other breast (CRRM) may reduce the incidence of cancer in that other breast, but there is insufficient evidence that this improves survival because of the continuing risk of recurrence or metastases from the original cancer.
While published observational studies demonstrated that BRRM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies are suggested. BRRM should be considered only among those at high risk of disease, for example, carriers of mutations in the breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. CRRM was shown to reduce the incidence of contralateral breast cancer (CBC), but there is insufficient evidence that CRRM improves survival, and studies that control for multiple variables that can affect results are recommended. It is possible that selection bias in terms of healthier, younger women being recommended for or choosing CRRM produces better overall survival numbers for CRRM. Just over half of the studies were found to have a low risk of selection bias, that is, studies adjusting for systematic differences in prognosis or treatment responsiveness between the groups, and similarly, 60% had a low risk of detection bias, that is, studies considered systematic differences in the ways the outcomes were measured and detected. The primary cause for both selection bias and detection bias was not controlling for all major confounding factors, e.g., risk factors or having bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (BRRSO - surgery to remove fallopian tubes and ovaries) in the subject and control groups. Performance bias (validation of the risk-reducing mastectomy) was not problematic, as most studies were based on surgical reports; three relied on self-reports and eight were unclear because of multiple sources of data and/or broad timeframe. Attrition bias was at high risk or unclear in approximately 13% of the studies. The mean or median follow-up period reported was from 1 - 22 years. Given the number of women who may be over-treated with BRRM/CRRM, it is critical that women and clinicians understand the true risk for each individual woman before considering surgery. Additionally, thought should be given to other options to reduce breast cancer risk, such as BRRSO and chemoprevention, when considering RRM.
This review is up-to-date as of 1 February 2019. The review includes 10 studies but we could only use the information from nine studies involving 1798 randomised people. We have asked for more information about one study. The review looks at eight different ways of applying fluoride to the teeth. People taking part in the studies were all having treatment with fixed braces. The number of people with new decay on the teeth at end of fixed brace treatment, as well as the amount of decay in each person, were measured and counted.
We compared the following treatments:
- dentist or nurse-applied fluoride e.g. varnish, gel or foam,
- patient-applied/used fluoride e.g. toothpaste, mouthwash, gel or foam, and
- materials that release fluoride over time e.g. glues, elastic bands. One study showed that when the dentist applies a foam with a high level of fluoride in it onto the teeth every time the patient is seen, this might reduce the risk of new decay. Another study found that if patients use a toothpaste with a higher level of fluoride than normal, then this might also reduce the risk of new marks on their teeth.
No studies have shown that other ways of giving the teeth extra fluoride reduced the number and/or size of new decay on teeth in people wearing fixed braces. Harmful effects of the different ways of giving the teeth more fluoride were not reported in any of the included studies. The level of belief we have in these findings is low, due to the lack of studies testing the same fluorides and showing the same results. We suggest that more, well-conducted studies should be done in this area.
This review identified only three small randomized trials. The results showed that only aspects of work performance (for example, maximal test time, maximal distance at the end of the exercise test) were improved after aerobic exercise training programs. Further well-designed research on larger population samples is required to evaluate potential benefits for psychosocial aspects in adults with Down syndrome.
We wanted to know if IL-6 blocking agents are effective treatments for people with COVID-19, compared with standard care alone or with placebo (a dummy treatment that appears identical to the medicine being tested but without any active medicine). We were particularly interested in the effects of IL-6 blocking agents on:
- whether people’s symptoms got better or worse;
- how many people died; and
- any unwanted effects and serious unwanted effects. We searched for studies that tested if medicines that block interleukin-6 can treat COVID-19 effectively. We looked for randomized controlled studies in which the treatments people received are decided by chance. We compared and summarized the results of the studies. We used a standardized method to rate our confidence in the evidence. The confidence is based on study features such as study design and the number of people included. We found 32 studies in 12,160 people with COVID-19. The average age of people was 56 to 75 years, and 66% of the participants were men. The studies took place at hospitals in different countries around the world. Eight studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies.
The medicines most tested were tocilizumab and sarilumab.
We found 17 additional registered studies of IL-6-blocking medicines to treat COVID-19; these studies have no published results. Ten of these studies have either been completed or are still in progress. Seven were terminated. Compared to placebo or standard treatment, treatment with tocilizumab:
- reduces the number of people with COVID-19 dying, of any cause, around 28 days;
- probably makes little or no difference on clinical improvement around 28 days;
- probably results in little or no difference in unwanted effects.
We are uncertain about the effects of tocilizumab treatment on:
- clinical improvement around 60 days;
- severity of COVID-19; that is, how many patients needed a ventilator or additional organ support or died of COVID-19 around 28 days;
- how many patients die, of any cause, around 60 days.
Compared to placebo or standard treatment, treatment with sarilumab:
- probably makes little or no difference in clinical improvement (defined as leaving the hospital or improvement in COVID-19 symptoms) around 28 days.
We are uncertain about the treatment effects and unwanted events of sarilumab, clazakizumab, olokizumab, siltuximab, and levilimab, compared to placebo or standard treatment. Our confidence in the results of clazakizumab, olokizumab, siltuximab, and levilimab is limited because of the low number of studies conducted and the small number of people included in these studies. We were unable to assess the variation in effects due to changes in the standard treatment provided, and we were also unable to see if effects were different in people of different ages or genders.
Further, most of the studies included in the review were conducted before the waves of different variants of concern and before vaccination was rolled out on a large scale. The evidence is up to date to 7 June 2022.
The review authors searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic intravenous betamimetic therapy with inactive or no treatment for women with uncomplicated pregnancies and whose babies were not showing signs of stress during the second stage of labour. They identified two trials involving 164 women, both conducted in the 1970s. One trial reported on clinical outcomes and found no beneficial differences in clinical neonatal outcome or Apgar scores at two minutes with tocolysis. The mean umbilical arterial pH values were slightly higher in the treatment groups of the two trials and intravenous betamimetics may prevent the deterioration of fetal arterial pH levels during the second stage of labour, possibly related to use of the supine position in these trials. Women receiving betamimetic drugs were more likely to have forceps delivery, which is the use of surgical tongs to assist the baby through the birth canal. Both trial protocols required forceps to be used if the second stage of labour, or time from initiation of the betamimetic infusion, exceeded 30 minutes. There were no clear differences in postpartum haemorrhage. The authors found inadequate evidence of benefit to recommend the prophylactic use of tocolytics in the second stage of labour.
We included all trials that compared any surgical technique with no surgery or placebo surgery, and also trials comparing different surgical techniques with each other, including fusion and spinal implants. All the patients included in these studies were diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and had symptoms in the leg or thigh that worsened by walking or standing and were generally relieved by a change in position, such as bending forward or sitting. The main measure we used to compare how well the different types of surgery worked was how much less pain people felt as they went about their daily lives. We also looked at whether their leg pain improved, how much blood they lost during surgery, how long the surgery took, how long they had to stay in hospital, how many patients had to have another operation for the problem and how much the treatment cost. Twenty-four randomised controlled trials were included with a total of 2352 people. We did not find trials that compared surgery with no treatment or placebo surgery, so all included trials compared different surgical techniques. The quality of the evidence from these studies varied from very low quality to high quality. This large variation was mainly due to different study protocols, surgical techniques and quality of reporting according to the 'Risk of bias' assessment. We found that patients who had decompression plus fusion fared no better than those who underwent decompression surgery alone. In fact, decompression plus fusion resulted in more blood loss during surgery than decompression alone. Although the spinal spacers were slightly better than decompression plus fusion in terms of improvements on daily activities, there were no differences when they were compared with decompression alone. Finally, we found no differences between different forms of decompression.
We wanted to find out which ways of communicating with patients and carers might be best for improving people’s knowledge about the EoL (e.g. what to expect, treatment options).
What people thought about the communication (e.g. satisfaction, communication quality, how involved they were and wanted to be in consultations). Discussions about end of life (e.g. how often these happened, and when).
We also wanted to find out if communication interventions might increase unwanted or harmful effects, like fear or distress. We searched for studies that looked at communication interventions compared with usual care (care that is provided routinely or as the standard way of treating people), or comparing one type of communication (e.g. providing information) with another (e.g. providing information together with support), in people of all ages from birth onwards and who were expected to die within 12 months. We summarised the results of the included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study size, study methods, and the people studied by the trials.
To ensure this review's focus was maintained on interpersonal communication in the last 12 months of life, we excluded studies that addressed specific decisions, shared or otherwise, and the tools involved in such decision-making. We also excluded studies focused on advance care planning (ACP) reporting ACP uptake or completion as the primary outcome. Finally, we excluded studies of communication skills training for health professionals unless patient outcomes were reported as primary outcomes. We found eight studies that compared the effects of communication interventions for people at EoL with usual care. Interventions were varied and ranged from simple approaches like a list to help patients and carers ask questions in consultations, through to complex structured conversation interventions to engage patients and carers in discussions about EoL and the care they wished to receive.
We found that a family conference intervention may increase the length of EoL discussions in some situations, and a structured serious illness conversation guide might lead to earlier discussions between patients, carers and health professionals about EoL and EoL care.
We also found there may be little effect of communication interventions on knowledge, on what people thought about the communication (e.g. quality of communication, how involved in the discussion they would like to be) or on outcomes like numbers of questions asked by patients in consultations with their doctors. We did not find any evidence of harmful or negative effects of the interventions, but the studies were mostly small and not designed primarily to identify these.
There may also be little effect on the other outcomes we looked for, like quality of life, quality of EoL care, or numbers of care goals met. In other cases, we are unsure because there was little or no evidence available (e.g. health professional outcomes like knowledge or confidence to communicate, or health service use e.g. hospital admissions). We have very little confidence in the evidence: included studies only looked at communication for older adults in high-income countries, whereas the review looked for evidence across the whole lifespan and irrespective of country and setting. Additionally, included studies often studied small numbers of people. The evidence is up to date to July 2018.
The two studies included in analysis were well designed but no information about seizures was recorded after people stopped taking their trial medication, which may have impacted on the results of the study.
Most people (70%) included in the studies within this review had focal onset seizures, so the results are mainly relevant to people with this epilepsy type. Also up to 30% of the people in the trials used in our results may have been wrongly classified as having generalised seizures, which may have impacted on the results.
For these reasons, we judged the quality of the evidence provided by this review to be of moderate quality for people with focal onset seizures, and low quality for people with generalised onset seizures. For people with focal onset seizures, oxcarbazepine may be a preferable treatment to phenytoin, but more information is needed for people with generalised onset seizures to choose between these medications. We recommend that all future trials comparing these medications, or any other antiepileptic medications, should be designed using high-quality methods. Seizure types of people included in trials should also be classified very carefully.
We included eight studies with 510 participants (443 boys, 67 girls) in our review. Participants in these studies were children with both ADHD and a chronic tic disorder. The included studies evaluated several different medications for ADHD, including stimulants (methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine) and non-stimulants (clonidine, guanfacine, desipramine, atomoxetine, and deprenyl). All studies took place in the USA and ranged from three to 22 weeks in duration. Five of the eight studies were funded by charitable organizations or government agencies, or both. One study was funded by the drug manufacturer. The other two studies did not specify the source of funding for the study. The trials in this review suggested that several stimulant and non-stimulant medications may improve ADHD symptoms in children with ADHD and tics. At high doses, dextroamphetamine may initially worsen tics in some children, and dose increases of both dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate may be limited due to tic exacerbation. However, for most children, both tics and ADHD symptoms can improve with use of stimulant medications. There is low-quality evidence for methylphenidate, atomoxetine, and clonidine, and very low-quality evidence for desipramine, dextroamphetamine, guanfacine, and deprenyl in the treatment of ADHD in children with tics. The evidence was limited by the small number of trials, small number of participants, and risk of bias of the included studies.
In this review we sought to compare supported housing schemes with outreach support schemes or 'standard care' for people with severe mental disorder/s living in the community. We did not identify any studies from randomised trials in this review. There are a number of supported housing options funded by local authorities as well as charities which may be beneficial but could equally increase levels of dependence on professionals and provide greater exclusion from the community. Whether or not the benefits outweigh the risks are currently only a matter of opinion, debate and informal reports. There is an urgent need to assess the effectiveness of these schemes using well conducted randomised trials.
We searched for evidence in February 2018 and found eight randomised controlled trials (involving 734 women) who had excessive uterine contractions, signs of fetal distress, or both during labour. The trials tested different comparison groups, which means that our analyses were based on data from single studies involving small numbers of women. Women were randomised to receiving a β2-adrenergic tocolytic drug or an alternative approach (including no tocolytic while awaiting caesarean section, stopping medications that increase contraction strength, or using a different tocolytic such as atosiban, magnesium sulphate or nitroglycerin).
We combined data from two small trials (57 women), comparing a β2-adrenergic tocolytic drug with no tocolytic drug. Two babies died in their mother's womb, both occurring in the group of women who did not receive a tocolytic - one had gross hydrocephalus (too much fluid in and around the brain) and the other occurred whilst the mother was waiting to have a caesarean section. The number of babies with an abnormal fetal heart rate is probably lower in the group of women who were given a tocolytic, but the effects on other measures of infant well-being were uncertain.
Very few serious side effects were found, but the studies were too small to assess uncommon adverse effects.
It is not possible to draw clear conclusions about the benefits and harms and the quality of the evidence was very low to moderate. There is not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine the effects of tocolysis for women with fetal distress or excessive uterine contractions, nor to identify whether one type of tocolytic drug is safer or more effective than another.
The clinical significance for some of improvements in measures of fetal well-being with tocolytics is unclear. Generally, sample sizes were too small to detect effects on maternal or infant well-being or serious adverse effects. The majority of studies were from high-income countries in healthcare facilities with access to caesarean section, which may limit the applicability of these results to lower-resource settings, or settings where caesarean section is not available.
Further high-quality studies, involving large numbers of women, are needed. Such studies could focus on measuring clinically relevant outcomes for the mother and her baby such as death of the mother, her baby, and other measures of well-being and safety.
The review included 26 trials with a total of 2051 participants. The findings suggested that music listening may have a beneficial effect on preoperative anxiety. Most trials presented some methodological weakness. Therefore, these results need to be interpreted with caution. However, these findings are consistent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music interventions for anxiety reduction in medical patients. Therefore, we conclude that music interventions may provide a viable alternative to sedatives and anti-anxiety drugs for reducing preoperative anxiety.
We found that the quality of the 20 included studies was low, and the number randomised was small. The majority of the included studies did not report death as an outcome. We found that continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), as compared with continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH), may prolong circuit lifespan. In addition, pre-dilution haemofiltration, as compared with post-dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter placing the tip at the right atrium, as compared with a shorter catheter placing the tip in the superior vena cava, and surface-modified double lumen catheter, as compared with standard double lumen catheter, may extend the circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow compared to standard blood flow rate might not affect circuit lifespan. Overall, the data was limited and of very low certainty. We found that the effects of non-pharmacological interventions in people with AKI receiving CKRT remain unclear. There is a need for studies assessing CKRT circuit lifespan as well as other clinically important outcomes.
Clinical trials to test these hypotheses were performed before currently used criteria for dementia had become generally accepted. The results show improvement after the treatment with vinpocetine versus placebo, but the number of demented patients treated for at least six months was small. The available data does not demonstrate many side effect problems. Although the basic science is interesting, the evidence for beneficial effect of vinpocetine on patients with dementia is inconclusive and does not support clinical use.
This review included 21 studies involving 1799 people with COPD. Maintenance rehabilitation programmes were supervised at monthly or shorter intervals, but two studies had longer intervals between sessions. All the programmes were supervised, but some were supervised over the telephone, some were face-to-face, and some were a mixture of both. All maintenance programmes in this review gave people supervised exercise training. Some of the programmes also included education sessions. Most programmes lasted between six and 12 months. At six to 12 months follow-up, compared with usual care, supervised maintenance programmes did appear to improve quality of life and physical function by a small amount. The studies did not show reduced hospitalizations, exacerbations, or mortality. There were no adverse events related to maintenance programmes, suggesting that maintenance programmes are safe. Many studies showed a high risk of bias because participants knew whether they were in the intervention group or the control group. Some outcomes were based on a small number of studies, and patients, resulting in inconsistent and imprecise results. This means that these results may not apply to all supervised maintenance programme models of delivery.
This review looked at the effects of attaching artificial teeth either the same day that the implant was placed, or early (after only 6 weeks) compared to the usual delay of at least 3 months. Some studies also compared the artifical tooth being attached so that it did not touch the opposite tooth (non-occlusal loading). The search of studies was updated on 8th June 2012. The review found no evidence that attaching artificial teeth either immediately, after 6 weeks (early) or after at least 3 months (conventional) led to any important differences in the failure of the implant or the artifical tooth, or to the amount of bone which surrounded the implant (any bone loss would be an undesirable consequence). More research is needed in this area.
We wanted to find out if CS was better for people living with dementia than usual care or unstructured social activities to improve:
- cognitive abilities (including memory, thinking and language skills)
- well-being and mood
- day-to-day abilities
- distress and upset for the person with dementia and/or carers
We also wanted to find out if family carers experienced any changes associated with the person with dementia receiving CS or if there were any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that looked at group or individual CS compared with usual care or unstructured social activity in people living with dementia.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 37 studies involving 2766 participants with mild or moderate dementia and an average age of 79 years. The biggest study involved 356 participants, the smallest 13. The studies were conducted in 17 countries from five continents, with most in Europe. Fewer than half (16) included participants living in care homes or hospitals. The length of the trials varied from four weeks to two years. Sessions per week varied from one to six. The overall number of sessions varied from eight to 520. Most studies lasted for around 10 weeks, with around 20 sessions. Most studies offered CS in groups, with just eight examining individual CS. No negative effects were reported. We found that CS probably results in a small benefit to cognition at the end of the course of sessions compared with usual care/unstructured activities. This benefit equates roughly to a six-month delay in the cognitive decline usually expected in mild-to-moderate dementia. We found preliminary evidence suggesting that cognition benefited more when group sessions occurred twice weekly or more (rather than once weekly) and that benefits were greater in studies where participants’ dementia at the outset was of mild severity.
We also found that participants improved on measures of communication and social interaction and showed slight benefits in day-to-day activities and in their own ratings of their mood. There is probably also a slight improvement in participants’ well-being and in experiences that are upsetting and distressing for people with dementia and carers. We found CS probably made little or no difference to carers' mood or anxiety. Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about differences in results between studies. We cannot be certain of the exact reasons for these differences, but we noted that studies varied in:
• the way CS was delivered (individually, in groups, using an app) and the programme of activities included
• who delivered the programme (trained professionals, care workers, family carers)
• the frequency of sessions (1 per week to 5 per week)
• the duration of the programme (from 4 weeks to 1 or 2 years)
• the type(s) of dementia with which participants were diagnosed and the severity of the dementia
• whether participants lived in care homes and hospitals or in their own homes
We were unable to examine as many of these sources of potential difference as would have been desirable because of the relatively small number of studies reflecting each aspect. This review updates our previous review from 2012, with evidence up-to-date to March 2022.
We found 38 trials involving 3550 women, some comparing CCBs (mainly nifedipine) with no tocolytics and others comparing CCBs with tocolytics. The trials included in this review were considered to be of fair quality. We found that CCBs, specifically nifedipine, is better than no tocolytics for postponing preterm birth for 48 hours, which may help improve outcomes for babies. Compared with betamimetics, CCBs were more effective at postponing birth, had fewer side effects for women, and appeared to improve some important short-term outcomes for the baby (breathing difficulties, gut infections, and admission to special care units). Calcium channel blockers were better than other types of tocolytics for some outcomes only. Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORAs) appear to have fewer side effects for women than CCBs, but ORAs are not as good at reducing preterm birth. Another type of CCB, nicardipine, was only used in three trials, but was not more effective than other tocolytics. Longer-term infant and childhood outcomes were not able to be assessed due to lack of available information. In general, CCBs are more effective than betamimetics, but only sometimes more effective than other types of tocolytics.
We wanted to find out if exposing infants to the smell and taste of milk before or while they were being fed through a tube could help them tolerate greater volumes of milk more quickly and improve their overall growth and development. We also wanted to know if this method had any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that investigated exposing preterm infants to the smell or taste (or both) of milk with tube feeds, compared to no such exposure. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated the certainty of the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and number of infants included. We identified eight completed studies involving 1277 preterm infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit.
Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on the time to reach full sucking feeds, but the results are very uncertain. Two studies reported that no infants had any unwanted effects related to exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk may have little to no effect on duration of intravenous nutrition (feeding through a vein), time to reach full enteral feeds (feeds though a tube into the stomach), or on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious intestinal disease), although the results for time to full enteral feeds are very uncertain. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk probably has little or no effect on the risk of developing an infection more than two days after birth. We have little confidence in the evidence because:
• we identified few studies;
• most studies were small and provided different types of exposure to smell and taste;
• in many studies, clinicians and parents were aware of which treatment the infant was receiving; and
• the studies did not investigate all the outcomes we were interested in. This review is current to April 2023.
There is an absence of evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or surgical interventions for management of obesity in individuals with bipolar disorder. There is an urgent need to undertake randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical approaches for the treatment of obesity in bipolar disorder populations. Trials should include only people with a clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder and comorbid obesity.  Findings from this review suggest that there is no evidence to support non-pharmacological, pharmacological, or surgical approaches for the management of obesity in bipolar disorder. There is a need to undertake well-designed randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and/or surgical interventions to address obesity in bipolar disorder. Studies must focus on bipolar participants only, as distinct from mixed populations with serious mental illness, and all trial participants must have received a diagnosis of comorbid obesity. We identified several ongoing studies that may be included in the update of this review.
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) analysing the effects of anti-seizure medications (ASMs) for treating LGS. We included any RCT that compared ASMs, whether as monotherapy or add-on (adjunctive) therapy, with placebo (pretend treatment), no treatment or another kind of treatment. We then compared the results of the RCTs we found, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the 'certainty' of evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. This review included 11 trials (1277 participants, including children, adolescents and adults). The trials lasted between about 11 weeks and 112 weeks after randomisation. None of the included trials compared one ASM on its own with another treatment. Two trials compared add-on cannabidiol regimens (cannabis-based medicine) with add-on placebo regimens (396 children, adolescents and adults ). One trial compared an add-on cinromide regimen with an add-on placebo regimen (56 children and adolescents only). One trial compared an add-on clobazam regimen with an add-on placebo regimen (238 participants). One trial compared an add-on felbamate regimen with an add-on placebo regimen (73 participants). Two trials compared add-on lamotrigine regimens with add-on placebo regimens (186 participants). Two trials compared add-on rufinamide regimens with add-on placebo regimens (197 participants). One trial compared an add-on rufinamide regimen with another ASM regimen (37 participants). One trial compared an add-on topiramate regimen with an add-on placebo regimen (98 participants).
Most of the evidence in this review related to people from middle- or high-income countries and, where reported, participants of white ethnicity. We found high-certainty evidence that add-on lamotrigine increased the number of participants with at least 50% reduction in the average number of reported seizures. We also found low-certainty evidence that add-on lamotrigine may have reduced the number of participants with adverse events leading to study discontinuation when compared to add-on placebo.
We found high-certainty evidence that add-on rufinamide increased the number of participants with at least 50% reduction in the average number of reported seizures, when compared with add-on placebo. We also found low-certainty evidence that add-on rufinamide may have little or no difference in effect, compared to add-on placebo or another unspecified ASM, on reduction of the number of participants with adverse events leading to study discontinuation.
Add-on topiramate may have increased the number of participants with at least 75% reduction in the average number of reported seizures, and probably made little or no difference to the number of adverse events leading to study discontinuation, when compared to add-on placebo (low-certainty evidence).
Add-on felbamate (treatment phase) may have made little or no difference in terms of reported seizure freedom and adverse events leading to study discontinuation when compared to add-on placebo (low-certainty evidence). However, we found that when seizures were recorded in a research setting, add-on felbamate may have increased seizure freedom compared to add-on placebo (low-certainty evidence).
We remain uncertain whether other add-on drug therapies, including cannabidiol, cinromide and clobazam, reduced all types of seizures because this outcome was not reported or had very low-certainty evidence. We found high-certainty evidence that add-on cannabidiol and add-on clobazam increased the number of participants with adverse events leading to study discontinuation, when compared to add-on placebo. We did not find any evidence for adverse events leading to study discontinuation in the comparison of add-on cinromide with add-on placebo.
The evidence is current to March 2020.
We included two randomized controlled trials with a total of 194 patients that compared creatine with placebo for people with Parkinson's disease. The effect of creatine on improvement of motor function, activities of daily living or quality of life after one or two years treatment for Parkinson's disease was uncertain due to the low quality of the trials and the small number of participants they recruited. The serious adverse events that occurred in the trials were not thought to be related to creatine. However, one trial reported higher rates of gastro-intestinal effects (including diarrhoea, nausea and constipation) with creatine.
We found four studies with a total of 268 participants. These studies were conducted in Brazil, the UK, and the US. The evidence is current to 22 February 2016. Only one of the four studies compared the effect of antibiotic treatment for 12 months with placebo on visual acuity and found similar changes in both groups. Three studies examined the effect of antibiotics on reducing the number of recurring episodes of the disease. Two of these three studies were conducted in Brazil in adults infected with the more aggressive South American strains of the parasite, which can cause frequently recurring eye symptoms. The studies from Brazil found that the long-term antibiotics over 14 and 12 months, respectively, reduced the number of recurrent episodes of retinochoroiditis. The other study did not find that short-term (eight weeks) treatment with antibiotics made any difference. Two studies reported an improvement in intraocular inflammation in antibiotic-treated compared with untreated participants, and one study reported no changes. Two studies investigated side effects of giving antibiotics such as decreased white blood cells, loss of appetite, rashes and other allergic reactions and found only weak evidence that antibiotics increase the risk of side effects. There were problems with the design, conduct, and analyses of all of the studies, which could have biased the results. There was a lack of evidence about whether antibiotics (short or long term) prevent vision loss. More trials are needed, including trials of newer antibiotics.
We searched, in a wide-ranging way, for all the useful studies (randomised controlled trials, or RCTs) we could find on long-term treatment of people with bipolar disorder using valproate or any other mood stabiliser, or antipsychotic drugs, or placebo. Three of us looked at RCTs to make sure they were fair experiments. We extracted data from the studies, put all of the evidence together and carried out a statistical analysis to look for significant results.
We conducted these searches to 11 January 2013 and found six studies, including a total of 876 participants. The quality of the studies in terms of design was not good, which means that the effects of some drugs might have been overestimated. All of the trials taken together suggest that valproate might help to prevent relapse in bipolar disorder, especially depressive episodes. However, because of limited available evidence, conclusions on valproate compared with placebo and lithium (or other active drugs) cannot be made with any reliable degree of confidence. Lithium is an important drug to compare with valproate because lithium is already known to be effective in preventing relapses of bipolar disorder. When we combined the findings of all studies comparing valproate with lithium, the evidence did not favour valproate or lithium in terms of efficacy. People taking valproate over a long time were more likely than patients given lithium to keep taking their allocated medication. Clinicians and patients should consider the side effects of valproate, including alopecia, tremor and weight gain.
We also found a study that compared valproate taken alone with valproate combination therapy (two drugs taken at the same time). This study compared people who took lithium only or valproate only with people who took valproate and lithium together. No evidence showed that use of valproate and lithium compared with lithium alone helped to ensure that patients kept taking their allocated medication.
Approximately half of our findings provided moderate or high certainty evidence. However, 81% of our findings from analyses within the reviews included data only from one trial. These reviews had not been able to pull together the results of several trials. We could not identify any Cochrane Reviews for some commonly used treatments, such as psychological therapies. Generally, long-term follow-up was lacking and the use of multiple and diverse outcomes limited the possibility of combining results to give meaningful evidence. There is a lot of evidence for conservative management of urinary incontinence in women and the use of pelvic floor muscle exercises is strongly supported for most patients, regardless of the type of incontinence. However, there are many limitations with the current evidence for conservative treatment of urinary incontinence and often the evidence does not support clear clinical decisions. More research is urgently required to establish high-quality evidence addressing questions which matter to women affected by urinary incontinence.
This review aimed to investigate the effects of fluphenazine (decanoate and enanthate) for schizophrenia. Searches for relevant randomised controlled trials was run in February 2011 and October 16, 2013. Authors could include and extract data from 73 studies with a total of 4870 participants. There were more studies on fluphenazine decanoate than enanthate.The review authors rated the quality of the evidence in the included trials to be low or very low. A long-term result from only one trial indicated fluphenazine decanoate reduces the rate of relapse when compared with placebo (‘dummy treatment’). Three studies found that fluphenazine decanoate produced fewer general movement disorders than oral antipsychotics. However, other results showed, overall, the effects and outcomes, including adverse effects for fluphenazine (decanoate and enanthate) are similar to other oral and depot antipsychotics. Important outcomes and information about use of services, going into hospital, satisfaction with care and costs were not reported in any study.
Depot injections may offer an advantage over tablets (oral medication) in terms of people taking their medication (complying and adhering to treatment). However, this needs to be balanced with the likelihood of serious side effects, such as involuntary shaking, muscle stiffness, the inability to sit still and lowering in people’s mood. Results did not show any strong evidence that depot fluphenazine produced more adverse effects than other antipsychotics.
This should be addressed in future large scale and high quality studies.

Traditional Chinese herbal medicine is a common practice in the East, and some clinical trials show a benefit of herbal medicines for symptomatic treatment of this condition. This systematic review identified and included 75 randomised clinical trials evaluating the effects of various herbal preparations (including single herbs or mixtures of different herbs) for treating people with irritable bowel syndrome. The review shows that some herbal medicines improve global symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and/or constipation. However, the methodological quality of the majority of clinical trials evaluating these herbs was generally poor. There is evidence indicating that small, poor quality trials with positive findings are more likely to be associated with exaggerated effects. Although the included trials did not report serious adverse effects from using herbal medicines more research is needed to determine the safety of herbal medicines. In conclusion, herbal medicines might be promising for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. However, it is premature to recommend herbal medicines for routine use in irritable bowel syndrome. Testing the herbs in larger, well-designed trials is needed in order to establish sound evidence for their use.
We reviewed the medical literature to find randomised controlled trials on care delivered by specialised nurse compared to care by a doctor in the management of asthma. We found five studies on 588 adults and children. The studies were of good methodological quality. The number of asthma exacerbations (flare-ups) and the level of asthma severity did not differ at the end of the study period between the intervention and the control group. Only one study reported information about the costs associated with both kinds of care and there was no significant difference between them. There was also no difference in quality of life. We found no difference between nurse-led care and physician-led care. Based on the relatively small number of studies in this review, nurse-led care may be appropriate in patients with well-controlled asthma. More studies in varied settings and among people with varying levels of asthma control are needed with data on adverse events and healthcare costs.
This review of clinical trials concluded that there is no high quality evidence about whether electromagnetic therapy speeds the healing of venous leg ulcers and its effect is unclear.
We found 73 randomised controlled trials comparing GnRH antagonist with GnRH agonist in a total of 12,212 women undergoing ART. The evidence is current to May 2015 There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in live birth rates (i.e. rates at conclusion of a course of treatment). The evidence suggested that if the chance of live birth following GnRH agonist is assumed to be 29%, the chance following GnRH antagonist would be between 25% and 33%. However, the OHSS rates were much higher after GnRH agonist. The evidence suggested that if the risk of OHSS following GnRH agonist is assumed to be 11%, the risk following GnRH antagonist would be between 6% and 9%. The evidence was of moderate quality for both live birth and OHSS. The main limitations of the evidence were the possibility of publication bias for live birth (with small studies likely to report favourable outcomes for GnRH antagonist) and poor reporting of study methods for OHSS.
We searched in February 2021 and included four studies, with data for 744 women and babies. Overall, the evidence was uncertain or very uncertain due to the study methods and the inclusion of small numbers of women and babies. Study in Turkey involving women with spontaneous onset of labour and who had given birth before: routine vaginal examinations may result in a slight increase in pain compared to routine ultrasound to assess labour progress.
The study did not assess our other primary outcomes: positive birth experience; augmentation of labour; spontaneous vaginal birth; chorioamnionitis (inflammation or infection of the membranes around the baby); neonatal infection; admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Study in Ireland involving women in labour at term. Compared with routine rectal examinations, routine vaginal examinations may have little or no effect on: augmentation of labour; spontaneous vaginal birth; neonatal infections; admission to NICU.
The study did not assess our other primary outcomes: positive birth experience; chorioamnionitis; maternal pain. UK study involving women having their first baby in labour at term. Compared with routine two-hourly vaginal examinations, routine four-hourly vaginal examinations may have little or no effect on augmentation of labour or spontaneous vaginal birth - the results were compatible with both a benefit and harm.
The study did not assess our other primary outcomes: positive birth experience; chorioamnionitis; neonatal infection; admission to NICU; maternal pain. Study in Malaysia involving women having their first baby and being induced at term. Compared with vaginal examinations as indicated, routine four-hourly vaginal examinations may result in more women having their labour augmented. There may be little or no effect on spontaneous vaginal birth, chorioamnionitis, neonatal infection, or admission to NICU.
The study did not assess our other primary outcomes of positive birth experience or maternal pain. We cannot be certain which method for assessing labour progress is most effective or acceptable to women. Further evidence is needed to identify the best way to assess labour progress and how this may affect women's birth experiences.
This review includes one small pilot study with 52 participants. The study compared nidotherapy with standard care versus standard care alone and lasted 18 months. Findings suggest some limited evidence that those who received nidotherapy might experience a slight improvement in social functioning or personal relationships, mental state and may spend less time as inpatients in hospital over the course of 12 months, but there is no information concerning the appropriateness of this for the individual. However, these limited findings need to be treated with considerable caution. The degree of any possible improvements that come from taking part in nidotherapy remain unclear due to the single study’s small sample size, incomplete evidence and risk of bias. No evidence is available on the effect of nidotherapy on general functioning, quality of life, taking medication, satisfaction with treatment, employment status or adverse effects. Further research is required to fill this gap in knowledge about the effectiveness, benefits and possible hazards of nidotherapy. Until such a time, people with mental health problems, health professionals, managers and policymakers should consider this new therapy an experimental one.

We found five studies that included 1254 patients who had this type of cardiac arrest in the prehospital setting. Four of the five studies (1186 patients) were well-designed studies with low risk of bias. Although no adverse events were reported, aminophylline showed no advantage when it was added to the standard resuscitation practice of paramedics when compared with placebo in these patients. It is not known whether giving aminophylline sooner would be helpful.
This review looked at six trials, with a combined total of 885 patients, which compared different methods of making these grafts. Results from two trials which looked at the effect of inserting a cuff of vein at the lower end of the synthetic graft before attaching it to the artery below the knee are conflicting. With one study showing that the bypass graft remains functional for a longer period of time and in the other study no benefit was seen. If a synthetic graft is made in a fashion imitating the shape of a vein cuff, then the same benefit can be achieved. The results also show that when short lengths of vein are joined together to form a sufficiently long graft, the bypass works for longer, although this does not result in fewer amputations. Finally, there is no added benefit for graft patency or amputation rate if a connection is made between the artery and the vein (fistula) when constructing a vein cuff with the synthetic graft but the operation takes longer.
We searched for evidence on 1 November 2016 and identified 16 randomised controlled trials involving 4548 women for inclusion in the review.
In studies where women received progesterone by injection into the muscle compared with placebo (dummy treatment) more women gave birth before the 34th week of pregnancy in the progesterone group (low-quality evidence ). There was no clear difference between the groups in the likelihood of the baby dying before or soon after the birth (low-quality evidence ). No studies reported whether any women died or whether any babies had longer-term developmental problems or disability. There seems to be little or no difference between women receiving progesterone or placebo for other important outcomes, such as preterm birth before 37 weeks (high-quality evidence ); preterm birth before 28 weeks (moderate-quality evidence ) or infant birthweight less than 2500 grams (moderate-quality evidence). No childhood outcomes were reported in the trials.
In studies where women received vaginal progesterone there may be little or no difference between women receiving progesterone or placebo in preterm birth before 34 weeks (low-quality evidence ); although fewer births before 34 weeks occurred in the progesterone group, this finding may have occurred by chance. The number of infant deaths before or soon after birth was similar in both groups (low-quality evidence ). No studies reported maternal death or longer-term outcomes for babies. There may be little or no difference between groups receiving vaginal progesterone versus placebo in any other important outcomes (preterm birth before 37 weeks (moderate-quality evidence ); preterm birth before 28 weeks (low-quality evidence ); or infant birthweight less than 2500 grams (moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood outcomes were reported in the trials. For other outcomes, we found no clear group differences, except for caesarean section where women who received vaginal progesterone did not have as many caesarean sections as those in the placebo group (although the difference between groups was not large (8%)). Fewer infants whose mothers had received the vaginal progesterone needed mechanical help with breathing.
We did not find any studies looking at progesterone taken by mouth. Overall, for women with a multiple pregnancy, treatment with progesterone (either intramuscular or vaginal) does not appear to reduce the likelihood of preterm birth or improve outcomes for babies.
Future research could focus on looking at information about individual women taking part in studies, so that everything available about both intramuscular and vaginal progesterone treatments in women with a multiple pregnancy can be considered together.
We wanted to find out whether psychological treatment was better than usual care, treatment without a psychological component, or no treatment for improving the following outcomes.
1. Symptoms of anxiety
2. Symptoms of depression
3. Medical contacts (such as hospital admissions or emergency department visits)
4. Asthma attacks
5. Asthma symptoms
6. Medication use
7. Quality of life
We also wanted to know whether psychological treatment had any unwanted effects in children and adolescents with asthma. We searched for studies that had evaluated psychological treatment (such as behavioural therapies, cognitive therapies, or counselling) compared to standard asthma care, treatment without a psychological component, or no treatment in girls and boys aged five to 18 years with asthma. We included 24 studies that had enroled 1639 children and adolescents. We found mixed results for nearly all outcomes in this review: many treatments showed benefits, but others showed no evidence of an effect. The results of some studies suggest that psychological interventions could be beneficial for children and adolescents with asthma, particularly to reduce symptoms of anxiety or depression, reduce asthma attacks, reduce asthma symptoms, and improve medication use. For most studies, it was difficult to judge how important the benefits were because the assessment scales were not well described.
There is limited evidence that psychological interventions could reduce the need for medical contact or improve quality of life. No studies reported unwanted effects of treatment. Our results are very uncertain and difficult to interpret because the studies used different theories to develop their treatments, different tools to measure results, different follow-up periods, and different definitions for the outcomes (e.g. one study measured daytime symptoms while another measured total asthma symptoms). Because of these important differences, it was difficult to make comparisons between the studies. The number of children and adolescents was small in most studies, and some studies reported only part of their results. More high-quality research is needed to strengthen the evidence base for using psychological treatment in children and adolescents with asthma, and to determine which types of psychological treatment might be most helpful. The evidence is current to February 2023.
Animal studies (performed both in the laboratory and on living animals) suggest that estrogen alone might protect the brain as women get older. After the menopause, levels of estrogens decline in women and estrogen therapy has been claimed to maintain or enhance cognitive function in postmenopausal women. This review found no evidence of a benefit of any types of estrogen on overall cognitive functioning in older postmenopausal women when given either as short term or longer term (up to five years) therapy. There was also no evidence of a beneficial effect of combined estrogen and progestagen therapy overall. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether any type of hormone replacement therapy had beneficial or harmful effects on specific types of cognitive ability, such as verbal or visual memory.
We wanted to find out if removing hair before surgery:
· causes or prevents infections;
· prevents wound complications, such as cuts to the skin or the opening up of stitched wounds;
· has an impact on how long people stay in hospital after surgery; and
· has any cost implications.
We were also interested in whether some hair removal methods or times for hair removal are better than others. First, we searched for studies that compared:
· hair removal against no removal; or
· different methods and times of hair removal.
We then compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 25 studies that involved a total of 8919 people.
Ten studies compared no hair removal against hair removal, using:
· clippers (3 studies);
· shaving with a razor (8 studies, 7 of which provided useable evidence); or
· hair removal cream (1 study).
Seven studies compared using a razor against using clippers, and 10 studies compared using a razor against using cream (nine of these 10 studies provided useable evidence).
One study compared hair removal the day before surgery versus hair removal on the day of surgery. Hair removal compared to no hair removal
· Hair removal with clippers and cream may make little to no difference to the number of surgical site infections.
· Hair removal with a razor probably risks more infections than no hair removal.
Whether hair is removed with a razor or not removed may make little to no difference for length of hospital stay (1 study).
Comparisons of different hair removal methods
· Clippers probably cause fewer infections and skin injuries than razors.
· Cream probably causes fewer infections, and may cause fewer skin injuries, than razors.
Time of hair removal
Whether hair is removed on the day of surgery or the day before surgery may slightly reduce infection numbers (1 study). Due to a lack of robust studies, we do not know:
· if removing hair affects wound complications and costs when compared to not removing hair;
· if different hair removal methods have different effects on length of hospital stay, or on costs; and
· if the time of hair removal affects wound complications, length of hospital stay, or costs. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019.
We found 23 studies including 39,195 participants that compared niacin to placebo. The evidence is current up to August 2016. The majority of included participants were on average 65 years old and had already experienced a myocardial infarction. The participants took niacin or placebo for a period of between six months and five years. Seventeen out of 23 studies were fully or partially funded by the drug manufacturer with a commercial interest in the results of the studies. Niacin did not reduce the number of deaths, heart attack or stroke. Many people (18%) had to stop taking niacin due to side effects. The results did not differ between participants who had or had not experienced a heart attack before taking niacin. The results did not differ between participants who were or were not taking a statin (another drug that prevents heart attack and stroke). The overall quality of evidence was moderate to high.
In summary, we found no evidence of benefits from niacin therapy.
The purpose of this review was to assess the risks and benefits of YF vaccine for people living with HIV. We found three cohort studies that addressed this question. One study in children, from a time before effective widespread use of antiretroviral drugs, found that YF vaccine worked much less well in children with HIV than it did in those without HIV. Two studies in adults found that the immune response to yellow fever vaccine was slightly lower in HIV-infected patients. No severe adverse events were observed in patients in these studies. However, because the numbers of people with HIV who have received YF vaccine is small, and serious side effects are uncommon in people without HIV infection, we are not positive about its safety. When it does need to be used, it should be given to people whose viral loads are low and CD4 counts are high.
We wanted to find out if giving amino acids within the first 24 hours of birth compared to after the first 24 hours of birth to babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy improved growth and development, decreased the chance of death, and affected some normally occurring chemicals in the blood. We searched for studies in which babies who were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy randomly received amino acids early (within 24 hours of birth) or late (after 24 hours of birth). We found 9 reports (383 babies) in our search. However, not all of our outcomes of interest were reported in every study. Limited data from a few babies suggest that early amino acids may not result in any improvement in growth. Early amino acids may make little or no difference to chemicals in the blood. They may also result in a large gain in protein in the first three days after birth; however, what this means in relation to the health of the baby is unclear. The available evidence is not strong enough to support early initiation of amino acids in babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. The evidence is current to March 2023.
We reviewed 106 studies (up to July 2014) which included 13,631 people with moderate to severe rosacea. Most were between 40 and 50 years old, with more than twice as many women as men. Most studies lasted between eight to 12 weeks, with the longest lasting 40 weeks. The majority of people in these studies suffered from two rosacea subtypes, the subtype with pimples and pustules, or the subtype that causes flushing and persistent redness.
Of the 106 studies, 66 reported that they received funding, mainly by pharmaceutical companies. We were confident funding did not affect the results in 56 of these studies but had concerns about the remaining 10. Most of the treatments appeared to be effective in treating rosacea. Almost half of the studies reported how people assessed their treatments. Only 11 assessed changes to quality of life. Almost all studies reported side effects, although this information was often limited. Studies mostly evaluated changes in the number of pimples and pustules, and redness. Only five studies included ocular rosacea. None included the rare variant called 'granulomatous rosacea'.
Topical treatments
Two separate treatments, metronidazole and azelaic acid, were effective and safe in reducing rosacea symptoms. Improvements tended to appear after three to six weeks. With metronidazole, very few people experienced mild itching, skin irritation and dry skin. For some, azelaic acid caused mild burning, stinging or irritation. More research is needed to conclude which of these two treatments is best.
Ivermectin, a new treatment, was more effective than placebo and slightly more effective than metronidazole. Another newly registered treatment called brimonidine, especially for reducing redness, was shown to work up to 12 hours after being applied.
Oral treatments
Antibiotics such as tetracycline, a low dose of doxycycline or a low dose of minocycline reduced the number of pimples and pustules. Low dose doxycycline (40 mg) was likely as effective as 100 mg, but with much fewer side effects of diarrhoea and nausea. Azithromycin may be as effective as 100 mg doxycycline, but only one study addressed this treatment and better quality studies are needed to confirm this.
A low dose of isotretinoin (0.3 mg/kg), a vitamin A-related drug, appeared to be slightly more effective than 50-100 mg doxycycline for treating pimples and pustules. However, extra precautions need to be taken regarding contraception in women of childbearing age as this drug is known to cause malformations in the foetus.
Light-based therapies
Laser therapy and intense pulsed light therapy were both effective for the treatment of telangiectasia, but the studies examining these treatments only reported limited data.
Rosacea of the eyes or eyelids, or both (ocular rosacea)
Better quality studies are required on ocular rosacea, though ciclosporin 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion appeared to be more effective than artificial tears. We rated the quality of the evidence for several outcomes as very low to high. There was high quality evidence for azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, brimonidine, doxycycline and isotretinoin. The lower quality evidence for other treatments was mostly because there were few people in the studies, making the results less precise, and the lack of blinding (people knew which treatments they were receiving).
This is a review of the clinical evidence from randomized controlled trials on the effect of dexmedetomidine in the management of awake fibreoptic intubation. The review was conducted by researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration. Awake fibreoptic intubation (AFOI) is indicated for the management of patients with a difficult or unstable (critical) airway, such as those with airway deformity or tumour, airway injury or spinal cord instability. It is necessary in such a situation to maintain patient co-operation and reduce patient anxiety without causing severe adverse effects during the AFOI. Many agents, including fentanyl, remifentanil, midazolam and propofol, have been reported to assist with AFOI. However, these agents can cause respiratory arrest, loss of airway control or reduced cardiovascular (heart) function, especially when used in high doses, thus increasing the risk of low oxygen levels (hypoxaemia), aspiration, low blood pressure (hypotension) or slow heart rate (bradycardia).
Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist that can cause sedation, anxiolysis, analgesic sparing, reduced salivary secretion and minimal respiratory depression; this might be beneficial for patients with a difficult or unstable airway undergoing AFOI.
We searched the medical literature until May 2012 and identified four randomized controlled trials involving 211 patients that were appropriate for inclusion in the review. These studies compared dexmedetomidine versus midazolam, fentanyl, propofol or a sodium chloride placebo for patients undergoing AFOI. We reran our search in November 2013, and four studies are awaiting assessment. We will deal with them when we update the review.
Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced patient discomfort during AFOI compared with control groups in two included trials. No significant differences in intubation time, airway obstruction, low oxygen levels or treatment-emergent cardiovascular adverse events were reported during AFOI between the dexmedetomidine group and the control group.
Dexmedetomidine did not appear to be inferior to other medications. The data from this evidence database of modest size provide limited evidence to support the use of dexmedetomidine as an alternative or primary choice for AFOI. Further research should focus on this important topic. Additional well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to test the exact benefits of dexmedetomidine in the management of AFOI.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to provide robust evidence of the relative efficacy and safety of treatments. In many RCTs, clinicians (i.e. healthcare professionals inviting patients to take part in an RCT in which they provide at least one of the interventions) only invite a small proportion of the people who are eligible for trials to take part. Observational studies have been conducted to explore reasons for this but the results do not identify any factors that appear to have a consistent impact on recruitment.
Infliximab is a relatively new disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug that inhibits tumour necrosis factor alpha. Short term (six to twelve month) studies suggest infliximab is well tolerated, and in combination with methotrexate, decreases disease activity in RA. Infliximab 3mg/kg or 10mg/kg, in combination with methotrexate, taken every 4 or 8 weeks for either 6 or 12 months, significantly improved disease activity as measured by tender and swollen joints and ACR response rates. Pain and physical function also improved compared to those taking methotrexate alone. Infliximab significantly reduced radiographic progression at 12 months.
An early surfactant therapy strategy results in a greater number of infants receiving surfactant and so more infants being exposed to the potential risks of intubation and surfactant administration. Although no complications of surfactant administration were reported in the studies reviewed, infants treated with an early surfactant therapy strategy tended to have a higher prevalence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Two trials were terminated prior to achieving the targeted enrollment when the need for mechanical ventilation was found to be significantly different between groups at a scheduled interim analysis. Two other trials experienced slow enrollment leading to reduced numbers.
This review intended to determine the efficacy of the two screening tests for oesophageal cancer. We identified 3482 studies but none were RCTs of screening. Several non-comparative studies showed that the screening tests may increase the incidence of reported oesophageal cancer and improve the survival results after a screening test, but these results could indicate bias rather than a true causative effect. Therefore, there is a strong need for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), especially long-term RCTs, to determine the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and any adverse effects of screening for oesophageal cancer.
On 29 September 2015, we searched for all relevant clinical trials in which a rehabilitation treatment was compared with another rehabilitation treatment, no treatment or placebo (sham treatment). We found 22 trials with a total of 1521 participants that assessed the benefits and harms of different rehabilitation treatments following CTS surgery. Two of the trials were newly identified at this update. Based on these studies, we found limited and low quality evidence for the benefit of the reviewed treatments, including immobilisation with a wrist orthosis (splint), use of dressings post surgery, exercise, cold and ice therapy, different types of hand rehabilitation provided in combination, laser therapy, electrical treatments, scar desensitisation, and arnica. Few studies reported on the safety of these treatments.
More research is needed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the various types of rehabilitation treatment available for people following CTS surgery.
The evidence is up to date to September 2015.
The majority of the trials compared two different types of omega 3 fatty acids, EPA (usually as E-EPA) and DHA with placebo, in people with schizophrenia who are stable on antipsychotic medication. Some of these trials show some improvement in general functioning and in mental state but not to a statistically significant degree. In the longest trial there was no difference between the two groups at the end of the study.  One trial compared E-EPA with DHA and found a suggestion that E-EPA works better than DHA, but again it was not statistically significant.  Where EPA was compared to placebo as a first line treatment for schizophrenia (30 people), those taking EPA had a better overall outcome and improvement in mental state.  However, this was a short trial with few people. Finally, one trial compared a type of omega 6 with placebo in men who had the movement disorder tardive dykinesia (16 people). There was no improvement in the symptoms of movement adverse effects in either group at the end of six weeks.
These trials were both small and short.  In addition most of the data they reported were not able to be used, and half of the trials were funded by the group supplying the trial medication. Therefore it is still not clear whether taking manufactured omega 3 or 6 improves overall functioning or mental state in people with schizophrenia.

Colchicine, a plant alkaloid, has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and was tested in randomised clinical trials. When all identified trials were combined, colchicine appeared to be not significantly different from placebo/no intervention in respect to mortality, mortality and/or patients who underwent liver transplantation, liver complications, liver biochemistry, liver histology, and the occurrences of adverse events. Colchicine may reduce pruritus, but this finding may be due to bias. The addition of ursodeoxycholic acid did not significantly influence the effect of colchicine.
In this review, we included five randomised controlled trials, with a total of 265 participants. All participants had Ménière's disease and their ages ranged from 19 to 74 years. In all of the studies positive pressure therapy was compared with a placebo device. For our primary outcome, control of vertigo, we could not combine the results from the different studies because of differences in the way the outcome was measured. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the active groups and placebo groups in terms of vertigo days. Only one study found significantly lower subjective scores for vertigo in favour of the positive pressure therapy group when compared to the placebo group.
When we combined the results from two studies we found that after treatment patients in the placebo group had better hearing levels compared to those in the positive pressure therapy group. The severity of tinnitus and perception of aural fullness were either not measured or the included studies did not provide enough information for us to comment on them. We did not find an overall statistically significant result for functional level. We also looked at 'sick days' but we did not find a statistically significant difference between groups in the two studies that measured this. No complications or adverse effects were noted by any study. Overall, the studies were at varied risk of bias: three out of five studies were at low risk, one was at unclear risk and one was at high risk of bias. The evidence is up to date to June 2014. In conclusion, this review has not found adequate evidence to prove the effectiveness of positive pressure therapy. Further research is needed.
This review on the effects of Padma 28 includes five trials with a total of 365 participants (current until September 2015). The review showed that Padma 28 has some beneficial effects in improving maximum and pain-free walking distance. The groups treated with placebo did not show an improved maximum and pain-free walking distance. Unfortunately the studies reported insufficient data to allow the comparison of the change in walking distances in the Padma 28 group with the change in walking distances in the placebo group. Combining the data of maximum walking distance after treatment in two studies showed that there was a longer maximum walking distance in the Padma 28 group compared with the placebo group after 16 weeks of treatment. No change in ankle brachial pressure was observed. Mild side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, tiredness and skin eruption were also noted but these were not different between the Padma 28 and placebo groups.
Quality of the evidence
Overall, the quality of the studies was low, with evidence of publication bias, small number of trials, limited reporting of the analyses that compared treatment groups and bias due to a high percentage of withdrawals in the placebo groups because of lack of improvement or deterioration of the overall condition. We therefore feel there is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of Padma 28 in the routine management of IC. Further well-designed research would be required to determine the true effects of this herbal preparation.
This review included evidence available up to 30 June 2014. Seven trials with low to moderate risk of bias were included: five in children (987 participants) and two in adults (156 participants). An eighth trial in 40 adults was at high risk of bias and did not provide any data for analysis.
Although some studies in children followed participants for two or three years, reliable information is only available for up to about one year after surgery due to the high number of participants missing follow-up after the first year. Some studies had recruited children who were more severely affected by tonsillitis than other studies (for example, they had tonsillitis more often and with more severe symptoms). Therefore, we grouped the children into 'severely affected' and 'less severely affected' subgroups.
Two studies in adults had a short duration of follow-up (five to six months following surgery). We found that in general children affected by recurrent acute tonsillitis may have a small benefit from adeno-/tonsillectomy: this procedure will avoid 0.6 episodes of any type of sore throat in the first year after surgery compared to non-surgical treatment. The children who had surgery had three episodes of sore throat on average compared to 3.6 episodes experienced by the other children. One of the three episodes is the episode of pain caused by surgery.
When it comes to avoiding bad sore throats, children who have more severe or frequent tonsillitis may benefit more from surgery compared to less severely affected children. In less severely affected children the potential benefits of adeno-/tonsillectomy are more uncertain. There are no good quality data for the effects of surgery in the second or later years after surgery.
We did not find enough evidence to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of tonsillectomy in adults with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis. Evidence is only available for the short term and is of low quality. The data are also difficult to interpret as the studies do not take into account the days of pain that always follow the operation. Based on the two small trials, tonsillectomy seems to result in fewer days of sore throat in the first six months after surgery.
Two of the studies in children said that they could not find a difference in quality of life outcomes and one study could not find a difference in the amount of painkiller that children took to help with their sore throats.
Bleeding immediately after tonsillectomy or in the two weeks following surgery is an important complication. The studies did not provide good information to allow us to assess accurately the risk of these complications. We judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate for the data on children (this means that further research is likely to have an important impact on how confident we are in the results and may change those results). Quality is affected by a large number of children who are 'lost to follow-up' after the first year of the study. In addition, some children who are assigned to the 'no surgery' group end up having surgery.
The quality of evidence for tonsillectomy in adults in adults is low.
As always, any potential benefits of surgery should be carefully weighed against the possible harms as the procedure is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of bleeding (either during or after the surgery). In addition, even with good pain relief medication, the surgery is particularly uncomfortable for adults.
We aimed to investigate the beneficial and unwanted effects of rituximab for people with MS, when is used as a 'first choice' or as 'switching' (in other words, used when other medicines do not work well or become contraindicated).
We wanted to find out if rituximab was better than other medicines to prevent disability worsening and recurrence of relapse, and to improve well-being.
We also wanted to find out if rituximab was associated with any unwanted or harmful effects, for example, serious harmful effects, common infections, cancer, and mortality (death). We searched for studies that investigated rituximab compared with all other approved medicines for MS. We searched the literature up to January 2021. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and quality. We found 15 studies that involved about 16,000 people with MS and lasted one or two years. The biggest study was of 6421 people and the smallest study was of 27 people. The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high-income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two included studies. Rituximab as a first choice treatment in relapsing MS:
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study in 335 people);
– may reduce the number of people who have relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab, but the evidence is uncertain (evidence from one study).
There was no usable information on disability worsening, well-being, and serious harmful effects.
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in progressive MS:
– likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening over 24 months compared with pretend treatment (evidence from one study of 439 people);
– the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of rituximab on well-being and serious harmful effects.
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS:
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 1383 people), and fingolimod (evidence from one study of 256 people). The evidence is very uncertain on the comparison of rituximab with natalizumab;
– the evidence is very uncertain on disability worsening;
– likely increases slightly the number of people who have common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 5477 people), and natalizumab (evidence from two studies of 5001 people). The evidence is uncertain for the comparisons of rituximab with fingolimod and ocrelizumab.
There was no usable information on well-being and serious harmful effects.
Rituximab as 'switching' for progressive MS
Only three small studies investigated rituximab in secondary progressive MS. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening, well-being, and serious harmful effects. – Limited confidence about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening in all forms of MS.
– Limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive forms of MS.
– Studies were short with a median duration of 24 months. This review is up to day to 31 January 2021.
We wanted to find out whether pressure garments are effective for preventing hypertrophic scarring compared with other scar treatment options such as silicone gels and sheets, massage with lanolin, ointment containing the medicine heparin sodium, or no treatment. We searched for randomised controlled trials that compared:
– pressure garments versus other treatment options; or
– different pressures being applied by pressure garments;
– different types of pressure garment.
Randomised controlled trials are studies in which participants are assigned randomly to one of two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that groups of participants are similar, and that any differences between the groups are due to the treatment that is being evaluated.
We compared and summarised the trial results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 15 studies that involved 1179 people with (mostly burn) injuries that resulted in scars; 14 of these (1057 participants) presented useable data. Most studies included adults and children. The largest study had 159 participants and the smallest study had 17 participants. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, but most were done in China (five) and the USA (five). Most studies lasted for around six months; only three studies lasted for 12 months or more. The studies assessed a wide range of scar-related outcomes, for example: scar thickness, redness, itching, pain, complications from the treatment, or used a rating tool that included several scar characteristics. However, not all studies assessed the same outcomes.
We are unsure whether pressure garments (with or without silicone) improve scar-related outcomes compared with other treatments (with or without silicone), as the quality of the available evidence is very low. We did not find any evidence to suggest that pressure garments or silicone cause any serious harms, though a small amount of evidence suggested the pressure garments might cause more discomfort; however, we are unsure about this. We are very uncertain about the benefits or harms of pressure garment therapy compared with other scar management therapies for preventing hypertrophic scarring. Most studies involved only small numbers of people, and used methods that may mean some findings were biased. In some studies, people were aware of the treatment they were getting, which might have influenced how they rated any improvement of their scars. Some studies also included people who had scars resulting from injuries other than burns. Most studies were not long enough to show longer-term changes (12 months or more) to scars. The evidence is up to date to June 2023.
In this review, existing evidence comparing the health outcomes between treated and untreated individuals are summarized. Available data from the limited number of available trials and participants showed no difference between treated and untreated individuals in heart attack, stroke, and death. About 9% of patients treated with drugs discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. Therefore, the benefits and harms of antihypertensive drug therapy in this population need to be investigated by further research.
We found eight studies that contributed data and involved 8892 women and their babies. All studies were undertaken in hospital settings, seven in higher-income countries and one in a lower-income country. Four studies compared active with expectant management and four compared active with mixed management.
Overall, the quality of the evidence was generally low or very low and we need more data to be confident in the findings. For all women, irrespective of their risk of severe bleeding, active management may reduce severe bleeding and anaemia. However, it also may reduce the baby’s birthweight and increase the mother's blood pressure, afterpains, vomiting, and the number of women returning to hospital with bleeding. Findings were similar for women at low risk of bleeding, though it was unclear if there was any difference in the incidence of severe bleeding or anaemia. Women should be given information before they give birth to help them make informed choices. Some adverse effects experienced by mothers may possibly be avoided by using specific drugs. Delaying cord clamping may benefit the baby by preventing the reduction in birthweight from early cord clamping, but more research is needed. Also, it may be that just giving a uterotonic might reduce severe bleeding, without using the other parts of active management. More research is needed, particularly in low-income countries.
The review included nine trials with 645 participants. Six trials assessed TACE versus control and three trials assessed TAE versus control. All trials had risks of systematic errors ('bias'). Contrary to current practice in many hospitals, we could not demonstrate any beneficial effect of TACE or TAE on either survival or tumour growth in patients with primary liver cancer not suitable for surgical resection. Furthermore, we calculated that more clinical trials involving a further 383 trial participants may be needed before firm evidence may become available. Importantly, TACE or TAE is associated with a wide range of adverse events, some being potentially serious. Accordingly, we recommend that TACE or TAE should not be used as standard treatment for liver cancer until firmer evidence is available from randomised clinical trials.
The previous version of this review found minor differences in effects between anti-VEGF medicines at one year, which were unlikely to be clinically significant. In this update, we investigated if any differences in efficacy and safety exist after two years. We included all studies comparing anti-VEGF medicines with each other or with control and summarised data at two years. We found 23 relevant studies. Thirteen were industry-sponsored studies from the USA, Europe, or Asia. Ten studies received no industry funding and were from the USA, Europe, the Middle East, and South America.
There were results at two years for the medicines ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept, and brolucizumab. One study investigated conbercept, but this medicine is approved only in China. Results were available only at one year for the newest medicine faricimab. These anti-VEGF medicines were compared with no treatment, sham treatment, laser treatment, or each other. People participating in the studies received the medicines every month for the first three to six months, then less frequently. Decisions about long-term treatment were based on visual acuity or by looking at the back of the eye.
We found that all anti-VEGF medicines prevent visual loss and can improve vision in people with DMO, with no important differences in vision at two years between aflibercept, bevacizumab, brolucizumab, and ranibizumab, although aflibercept and brolucizumab yield a better control of retinal swelling than other medicines.
There was no evidence that these medicines increase the risk of death or cardiovascular events, but the quality of this evidence was poor. Few studies provided data comparing anti-VEGF medicines at two years, and estimates were often imprecise. We searched for studies that had been published up to 6 October 2021.
We looked at 59 randomised controlled trials with 11,561 participants. Thirty studies were either conducted or sponsored by the manufacturer of the study medication. On average, the overall quality of the evidence was moderate for the three most important comparisons that included corticosteroids (e.g. betamethasone dipropionate), vitamin D (e.g. calcipotriol) and their combination product. We looked for a reduction in the severity of the psoriasis, improvement in quality of life and harmful side effects of the treatments. Most findings were based on short-term therapies with a duration of less than six months. Prior investigators found that the combination product was more effective than the steroid alone, but clinically the benefit was questionable. Both treatments reduced scalp psoriasis better than vitamin D.
Due to poor information, we could not assess which treatment improved quality of life best. Most studies simply did not measure the improvement in quality of life.
Participants who applied vitamin D stopped treatment more often because of harmful side effects than those who applied a topical steroid or the combination product. Steroids were as likely as the combination product to cause discontinuation of the treatment because of side effects. However, only a few participants who used one of the three medications experienced harmful side effects. No study reported the type of side effect that made participants stop the treatment.
Participants assessed the efficacy of the treatments similarly to the investigator: those who applied a steroid or the combination product responded better to treatment than participants who used vitamin D alone. Statistically, the combination product was more effective than the steroid alone, but clinically the benefit was questionable.
The most common harmful side effects of these treatments were irritation, itching and skin pain at the site of application. Side effects on other sites of the body were very rare and most likely not caused by the drug.
Other findings were the following: steroids, vitamin D and their combination product were more effective than the vehicle preparation (cream, shampoo etc) that did not contain the active drug. Compared to one another, steroids tended to be similarly effective and have similar side effects, even though some were of a higher strength.
We could not sufficiently assess the efficacy and safety of other topical treatments, such as salicylic acid, tar or dithranol. Steroids and the two-compound combination of a steroid and vitamin D were most effective with the least risk of causing harmful side effects. Given the similar safety profile and only slim benefit of the two-compound combination over the steroid alone, topical steroids on their own may be fully acceptable for short-term therapy.
The following questions remain unanswered and should be investigated by future trials: Is there truly no difference in terms of effectiveness or safety between topical corticosteroids of different strength? Does the vehicle preparation (e.g. cream or shampoo) have any influence on how the active agent works? Which topical treatment leads to disease control over a long time span without risking patient's safety? Finally, there is a strong need for more studies that assess which topical treatments improve quality of life best.
These days the drugs of the latter type that are used for acute COPD are salbutamol and terbutaline, but neither of these drugs have been used in the only studies that we could find. We found only three small studies. Overall, both types of drug showed a small but worthwhile effect. There was no difference between them. Our review was not designed to test whether they would have had a greater effect if both were given at the same time.
Studies were conducted in Europe, Asia and North America with packages of family intervention varying among studies, although there were no clear differences in study design. Results indicated that family intervention may reduce the risk of relapse and improve compliance with medication. However data were often inadequately reported and therefore unusable. As this package of care is widely employed, there should be further research to properly clarify several of the short-term and long-term outcomes.
The evidence is current to December 2012. We identified a total of 11 controlled studies, including a total of 742 children, where clonidine was compared to another medication or to a dummy treatment (placebo). We found evidence that when clonidine is given at an adequate dose (4 µg/kg) it is effective in reducing the need for pain relief after surgery for children (and probably reduces the children's pain) when compared to a placebo. The evidence is less clear when clonidine is compared to the sedative drug midazolam; this is likely to relate to differences in the design of the clinical trials. The side effects of clonidine did not seem to be a significant problem at the doses used, although in some of the studies the investigators took measures to prevent such side effects by the use of other medications. Overall, the evidence so far is of low or unclear quality. Further research is required to confirm under what conditions clonidine premedication is most effective in children.
This systematic review investigated the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine compared to placebo and other mood stabilisers in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. No randomised controlled trials were found. Currently, there is insufficient evidence on which to base any conclusions regarding the use of tiagabine in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder, either in monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment. There is a need for randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.
No new studies were included for this update. Seven studies with 802 participants were included in this review. The review of trials found that the benefit of heparin, LMWHs and oral anticoagulants for treatment of intermittent claudication has not been established while an increased risk of major bleeding events has been observed, especially with oral anticoagulants. There is no clear evidence to support the use of anticoagulants for intermittent claudication at this stage. More research is needed.
We included 14 trials (854 participants with leprosy). Participants mostly had only one wound on one foot. Wounds were mainly simple (not infected) and varied in size and depth, and were less than one year old; some wounds were more complicated. Participants ranged from 18 to 74 years old. In the 11 studies which reported gender, more men were included. Studies were conducted in Brazil, Ethiopia, Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, South Korea, and India, in mainly outpatient clinics. Most studies did not report funding sources.
Treatments were mostly compared to dry dressings or dressings soaked in differing solutions. Other comparisons included special plaster, canvas shoes, and foot soak. Treatments evaluated included: laser therapy, light-emitting diode (LED), zinc tape or paste, pentoxifylline injections, exposure to pulsed magnetic fields, wax therapy, ketanserin gel, amniotic membrane gel, phenytoin powder, plaster shoes, and footwear. Outcomes were measured from the beginning of treatment. The following key results are based on very low-certainty evidence, so we are not sure of these results.
Three studies compared zinc tape with other interventions: magnesium sulphate glycerin, povidone iodine, or gauze soaked in Eusol. After one month of treatment, the number of healed ulcers was higher and the ulcer area was lower in the zinc tape group compared with magnesium sulphate glycerin. There was no clear difference in the reduction of ulcer area at six weeks when comparing zinc tape to povidone iodine. The healing time for deep ulcers in the zinc tape group was 17 days compared to 30 days with gauze soaked in Eusol. This study also reported no signs of skin sensitisation in either group at two months; the other two studies provided no data on adverse events.
Two studies compared topical phenytoin to salt water dressing. One study showed a greater reduction in ulcer area with phenytoin. The other study found a greater reduction in ulcer volume in favour of phenytoin. Both studies measured this outcome after four weeks of treatment. No adverse events were observed in either study.
The five studies just described did not assess prevention of ulcers, as the therapies were for treatment rather than prevention.
Two studies compared protective footwear (with or without self-care) with either polyvinyl chloride (PVC - a form of plastic) boots, or pulsed magnetic fields plus self-care and protective footwear. In the study comparing canvas shoes versus PVC boots, none of the participants who had scars at the start developed new ulcers over one year. There was no clear difference between the groups in the number of people whose ulcers had healed. In the study assessing pulsed magnetic fields, prevention of new ulcers was not measured; however, there was no clear difference between groups in volume of ulcers four to five weeks after the start of treatment. Only one study reported information about adverse events: the PVC boots could become very hot in strong sunlight, with the possibility of burning. We judged the evidence as very low certainty, meaning the results are ambiguous. There were concerns regarding how participants were allocated to treatments, whether participants and study investigators knew which treatment had been received, and the number of participants who dropped out of the studies.
We searched for all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies to a control, other psychological therapies or other therapies for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years. We identified 14 studies with a total of 758 participants. The types of trauma related to the PTSD were sexual abuse, civil violence, natural disaster, domestic violence and motor vehicle accidents. Most participants were clients of a trauma-related support service.
The psychological therapies used in the included studies were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), exposure-based, psychodynamic, narrative, supportive counselling, and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Most included studies compared a psychological therapy to a control group. No study compared psychological therapies to medications or medications in combination with a psychological therapy.
There was fair evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. More evidence is required for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in the longer term and to be able to compare the effectiveness of one psychological therapy to another.
The findings of this review are limited by the potential for bias in the included studies, possible differences between studies which could not be identified, the small number of identified studies and the low number of participants in most studies.
this review found two small studies that evaluated the effects of early versus late commencement of intravenous amino acids and fat in full term babies. However, relevant results were available from only one study, with evidence up to date as of 5 April 2019. late commencement of intravenous nutrition resulted in increased survival during hospital stay and in the first 28 days of birth.The timing of intravenous nutrition was not associated with an increased risk of hospital-acquired blood stream infections, growth and duration of hospital stay. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported. However, the quality of the evidence was considered to be low because the sample size was very small and the results were from only one study. while there were some benefits of late commencement of intravenous nutrition in term and late preterm babies, the quality of the evidence was low and so our confidence in the results is limited. Further trials are needed which investigate the best time to start intravenous nutrition in unwell newborn babies.
This review included evidence available up to April 2017. We included 29 studies, with a total of 2561 participants. All studies had a moderate or high risk of bias. Seven studies included adults, 16 studies included children and six included both adults and children.
Most studies measured pain using a patient-reported scale (for example, asking people to rate their pain on a scale of 1 to 10). The coblation technique may cause slightly less pain one day after surgery and three days after surgery, but it is unlikely that there is a difference in pain seven days after surgery. We are very uncertain whether the amount of pain reduction observed in days 1 to 3 after surgery would be important to patients.
There is little or no difference in the risk of bleeding in the first day after surgery, but there may be a small increased risk of bleeding with coblation after the first day. For every 1000 patients having a tonsillectomy, 50 patients would have a bleed with coblation, compared to 36 with traditional surgical techniques. The evidence for the difference in pain is of low or very low quality and for the difference in bleeding after surgery it is of low quality. This means that we have little confidence in the results; the true effect may be very different - we simply do not know at this stage.
This review includes 17 studies (from 54 reports) with 23,200 children. Four of the included studies were conducted in Malawi, three in Bangladesh, two in Ghana and one each in Burkina Faso, Haiti, Honduras, Chad, Congo, Kenya, Niger, Peru, Guatemala, and Indonesia. Four included studies enrolled pregnant women and provided LNS plus complementary feeding during pregnancy and post-partum, followed by infant supplementation starting at six months of age. The other studies provided LNS plus complementary feeding to children after six months of age. None of the included studies were conducted in emergency settings. Findings of this review suggest that LNS plus complementary feeding is probably an effective intervention for improving growth outcomes and reducing the occurrence of children who are of short stature for their age (stunting), have low weight for their age (moderate underweight), have low weight for their height (moderate wasting) and anaemia. Additionally, LNS plus complementary feeding probably improves height and weight for age as well as mid-upper arm circumference without adverse effects among children aged six to 23 months. The intervention seems to be more effective if provided for a duration longer than 12 months.
Evidence also suggests that LNS plus complementary probably reduces moderate stunting, moderate wasting and moderate underweight, compared to other FBF.
Furthermore, LNS plus complementary feeding is probably more effective than MNP at reducing moderate underweight and improving height and weight. Overall, we considered most studies to be at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of intervention. We rated the quality of the evidence for most outcomes as either low or moderate. The evidence is current to October 2018.
This review compared reduced dose (mean 60% reduction in inhaled steroid) ICS/LABA combination to either a fixed moderate/high dose ICS or a reduced/tapering ICS dose. In adults with asthma, who use moderate to high maintenance doses of ICS, the addition of LABA has an ICS-sparing effect. LABA permit a reduction of 37% (253 mcg BDP) in subjects on minimum maintenance ICS and up to 60% (300 mcg FP) in subjects on maintenance ICS without deterioration in asthma control.
We found 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antifibrinolytic medication with a different medical therapy, in a total of 1312 women with heavy menstrual bleeding. The evidence is current to November 2017. Antifibrinolytic medication may improve HMB in women aged 15 to 50 years old, without substantially increasing the rate of adverse events. Evidence suggests there is a 40% to 50% reduction in the amount of menstrual blood lost per menstrual cycle for participants taking TXA. Antifibrinolytic treatment was better at improving HMB loss than other medical treatments, except for the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LIUS), a plastic device placed in the uterus which releases hormone to prevent conception.
The evidence suggests that if 10.9% of women taking placebo report an improvement in HMB, 36.3% of women taking TXA will do so.
TXA probably improves quality of life for women with HMB.
We did not find any evidence that side effects (including life-threatening blood clots) were increased in women taking antifibrinolytic treatment compared to placebo or other treatments for HMB. Two studies measured venous thromboembolic events: unfortunately these studies did not have enough participants to distinguish a real effect of a certain size from pure luck. The evidence was of very low to moderate quality. The main limitations were: risk of bias, due to participants/investigators being aware of which medication they were receiving (known as lack of blinding), or the study's methods not being reported very clearly; imprecision (i.e. repeated measurements being far apart from each other), and inconsistency (i.e. as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution becomes increasingly wide around the true parameter value).
We searched a wide range of medical databases on 7 February 2018. We identified 2398 potential studies, 30 of which we looked at in detail. We found one suitable study, however although the study is complete the manuscript has not yet been accepted for publication, and so we were unable to analyse the data. We have assigned the study as awaiting classification; once its results are published we will evaluate it again and decide if it is eligible for inclusion in the review. We found one registered trial that is investigating our review question, but it is still ongoing and not yet completed or published. We failed to locate any published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support or refute the assertion that vascular access specialist teams are superior to the generalist model for device insertion and prevention of failure. However, this conclusion may change once the one study awaiting classification and the one ongoing study are published. There is a need for good-quality RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of a VAST approach for VAD insertion and prevention of failure. An RCT is a study (or trial) that aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. The people taking part in the trial are randomly allocated to either the group receiving the treatment under investigation or to a group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment) as the control. We did not analyse the quality of the evidence as we did not find any suitable studies to include in our review.
This review included 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including a total of 1806 participants. Five RCTs (411 participants) compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture for the treatment of IBS. Sham acupuncture is a procedure in which the patient believes he or she is receiving true acupuncture. However, in sham acupuncture the needles either do not penetrate the skin or are not placed at the correct places on the body, or both. Sham acupuncture is intended to be a placebo for true acupuncture. The sham-controlled studies were well designed and of high methodological quality. These studies tested the effects of acupuncture on IBS symptom severity or health-related quality of life. None of these RCTs found acupuncture to be better than sham acupuncture for either of these two outcomes, and pooling the results of these RCTs also did not show acupuncture to be better than sham acupuncture. Evidence from four Chinese language comparative effectiveness trials showed acupuncture to be superior to two antispasmodic drugs (pinaverium bromide and trimebutine maleate), both of which provide a modest benefit for the treatment of IBS, although neither is approved for treatment of IBS in the United States. It is unclear whether or not the greater benefits of acupuncture reported by patients in these unblinded studies are due entirely to patients’ greater expectations of improvement from acupuncture than drugs or preference for acupuncture over drug therapy. There was one side effect (i.e. fainting in one patient) associated with acupuncture in the nine trials that reported side effects, although relatively small sample sizes limit the usefulness of this safety data.
We found six studies, with a total of 334 adult participants. We found no studies that included people younger than 18 years of age. Four studies investigated psychological interventions. One study investigated an exercise intervention, and another investigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Three studies compared a psychological therapy (cognitive behaviour therapy or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy) with a no-treatment control intervention. When the data for these studies were combined, there was no reliable effect in support of psychological therapy. One study compared cognitive behavioural therapy with another psychological intervention (supportive psychotherapy), and did not find an effect in favour of either intervention. One study compared a supervised exercise programme with exercise as usual, but did not find a effect in favour of either intervention. One study compared rTMS plus an antidepressant medication with the antidepressant medication alone. Because the quality of the evidence was very low, it was not possible to draw the conclusion that the addition of rTMS improved outcomes. Only one study, of rTMS, reported any harmful effects and these were relatively minor and resolved quickly. The quality of the evidence was rated very low. All studies were at high risk of bias in some ways, and therefore it was not possible to draw conclusions in support of any intervention. There was a high degree of variability in the main results, which meant we could have little confidence in the findings. Some studies had major methodological flaws. It is not possible to recommend any particular treatment based on the current evidence. The review authors have made some recommendations to improve the quality of the evidence in future studies.
A literature search up to 02 Feburary 2020 found seven trials (containing 8323 participants, four trials at low risk of bias). Six of the studies were based in Asia. We found that antibiotics for H. pylori have a small benefit in preventing gastric cancer (68 (1.6%) of 4206 participants given treatment developed gastric cancer subsequently, compared with 125 (3.0%) of 4117 given no treatment or a placebo), and in decreasing the number of deaths from gastric cancer (36 (1.1%) of 3154, compared with 59 (1.9%) of 3147); but it is unclear whether or not they increase or decrease the number of deaths due to any cause, or increase or decrease the number of cases of oesophageal cancer. Data about side effects of treatment were poorly reported. Four trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. One study was at high risk of bias because no placebo was used for the active eradication therapy regimen, and so this part of the trial was unblinded, and the other study was at high risk of bias due to inconsistencies in data reporting at the two points of follow-up. We were unable to resolve this discrepancy despite contacting the original authors. As a result, we downgraded the quality of evidence from high to moderate due to serious risk of bias.
We identified four trials which compared FOBT to no screening and five trials which compared flexible sigmoidoscopy to no screening. No studies compared the two methods directly. Mortality from colorectal cancer was reduced with FOBT screening and screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy. When we compared the two methods, we could not conclude that one was better than the other.
No complications occurred after the FOBT test itself, but 0.03% of participants suffered a major complication after follow-up. Among more than 60,000 flexible sigmoidoscopy screening procedures and almost 6000 work-up colonoscopies, a major complication was recorded in 0.08% of participants. These findings should be interpreted with caution as the reporting of adverse effects was incomplete.
We searched key databases of medical studies up to February 2020 and found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (in 38 papers) that met our criteria. We grouped studies into the following three categories to help us with our interpretation of the results:
1. Vegan dietary intervention compared to no intervention or a minimal intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;
2. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;
3. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention for people with existing cardiovascular disease, to prevent recurrence. None of the trials reported on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease either in those with or without disease to begin with. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease were reported in the included studies. There was moderate-certainty evidence for some small reductions in lipid levels with the vegan diet compared to no or minimal intervention in people without disease, but also some very small changes in measures in the opposite direction for cardiovascular benefit. In people who already had cardiovascular disease there was very limited information, as only one trial met our criteria. Four trials reported on side effects of the diet, which were either absent or minor. Most studies had limitations in study design, so the evidence should be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the overall number of people who took part in the studies was too small to rule out the possibility of chance findings, and too small to pick up any differences in effect on our measures. The review concludes that there is no information currently about the effects of a vegan diet on cardiovascular disease occurrence. There is limited information on the effects of the diet on those who already have cardiovascular disease, and mixed results about risk factors for those without disease. We found eight studies that are still ongoing, and when we have the results from these we will incorporate them into the review to help reduce the uncertainty.
In December 2019, we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating topical treatments for facial burns. RCTs are medical studies where the treatment or care people receive is chosen at random. This type of study design provides the most reliable health evidence about whether different approaches to treatment or care can make a difference. We found 12 studies that were suitable for inclusion in this review update, with 507 participants with mean ages ranging from 5.3 to 41.9 years. Three studies compared antimicrobials with non-antimicrobials agents, two studies compared different antimicrobials, four studies compared skin substitutes with antimicrobials, while four studies compared a variety of topical treatments. One study contributed to two comparisons. Eight studies were small (fewer than 40 participants) and almost all studies were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding (where participants and evaluators may have known which group the participants were allocated to and interpreted effects differently). Overall, there is mainly low to very low-certainty evidence on the effects of any topical intervention on wound healing or infection in people with facial burns. In addition, there is low to very low-certainty evidence on the effects of the included interventions on need for surgery, pain, scar quality, patient satisfaction, length of hospital stay and side effects.
All results were at high risk of bias and varied, which may have exaggerated the effects. Overall, the certainty of the evidence about the effectiveness of topical treatments for facial burns is low to very low. There is insufficient reliable evidence as to whether topical treatments improve outcomes for people with facial burns including improving wound healing, or rates of infection. Better trial design and reporting of these studies is required to contribute to evidence-based burn care. We searched for studies that had been published up to December 2019.
This review identified five studies that included a total of 333 participants. Two studies compared methotrexate (administered by pill or intramuscular injection) to a placebo (a sugar pill or a saline injection). One of these two studies also compared methotrexate to 6-mercaptopurine (an immunosuppressive drug). One small study compared methotrexate to both 6-mercaptopurine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (an anti-inflammatory drug). Two studies compared combination therapy with methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug that is a tumour necrosis factor-alpha antagonist) to infliximab used by itself. One high quality study (76 patients) shows that methotrexate (15 mg/week) injected intramuscularly (i.e. into muscles located in the arm or thigh) for 40 weeks is superior to placebo for preventing relapse (return of disease symptoms) among patients whose disease became inactive while taking higher doses of intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg/week). Side effects occurred in a small number of patients. These side effects are usually mild in nature and include nausea and vomiting, cold symptoms, abdominal pain, headache, joint pain and fatigue. One small study (22 patients) found no difference in continued remission between low dose methotrexate (12.5 mg/week) taken orally and placebo and suggests that low dose oral methotrexate is not an effective treatment for inactive Crohn's disease. However this result is uncertain due to the small number of patients assessed in the study. Large-scale studies of methotrexate given orally at higher doses for maintenance of remission in Crohn’s disease may provide stronger evidence for the use of methotrexate in this manner. A pooled analysis of two studies (50 patients) found no difference in continued remission between oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) and 6-mercaptopurine (1 mg/kg/day). No firm conclusions can be drawn as these results are uncertain due to poor study quality and small numbers of patients. A small study (13 patients) found no difference in continued remission between methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid. No conclusions can be drawn from this study as the results are very uncertain due to poor study quality and small numbers of patients. A pooled analysis of two studies (145 patients) found no difference in continued remission between combination therapy and infliximab. Combination therapy with methotrexate and infliximab does not appear to be any more effective for maintenance of remission than infliximab used by itself. This result is uncertain because one study was of poor quality (the other was high quality) and small numbers of patients.
The review's aim was to assess the potential beneficial or harmful effects of HIV prevention advice in people with serious mental illness (SMI). A search for randomised trials comparing HIV prevention advice with standard care for people with SMI was run in January 2012 and July 2016. However, no studies or trials were found. Policy makers, health professionals, researchers and people with mental health problems need to collaborate to produce evidence-based guidance on how best to provide advice for people with serious mental illness in preventing the spread of HIV. Better guidance and information about HIV in people with mental illness could be found by conducting well-designed, simple and large studies on this important topic.

Six randomised studies enrolling 3185 participants were included in our review. Compared to less intensive CRRT, intensive CRRT did not reduce the risk of death, improve the recovery of kidney function, or reduce the risk of adverse events (such as bleeding) in patients with AKI. Intensive CRRT was associated with an increased risk of low blood phosphate levels.
We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of cycled light in the NICU on a baby's growth, nervous system development, length of hospital stay, length of oxygen treatment, and unwanted side effects. We searched for studies that looked at cycled light compared with near darkness or continuous bright light in the NICU. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes. We found 20 studies that involved 1633 babies who were born prematurely. The studies compared cycled light to near darkness or constant bright light in NICUs, and were conducted in countries around the world.
Compared to near darkness, we do not know whether cycled light makes a difference to a baby's growth, development of the nervous system, length of hospital stay, length of oxygen treatment, or unwanted side effects.
Compared to constant bright light, we do not know whether cycled light makes a difference to a baby's growth, development of the nervous system, length of oxygen treatment, or unwanted side effects. Cycled light may reduce the length of a hospital stay by 10 days, but we are very uncertain about these results. We are not confident in the evidence, because there are not enough studies with enough babies (sample size), that were conducted well, to be certain about the results. The studies did not all provide data about the outcomes of the review. This review updates our 2026 review. The evidence is up-to-date to September 2023.
We found 220 studies that reported relevant information, but the quality of the information was often poor. Studies were mostly from China and the USA. Most studies only had information on the small minority of cases that were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, often to the intensive care unit.
We found that high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease are very common in people hospitalised with COVID-19 and are associated with an increased risk of death. More than one-third of patients with COVID-19 had a history of high blood pressure, 23.5% had a pre-existing heart or blood vessel problem, 22.1% had diabetes, and 21.6% were obese (many people had more than one of these conditions).
The most common cardiovascular complication in people with COVID-19 was an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation; 8.5%). Blood clots in the legs (6.1%) or lungs (4.3%), and heart failure (6.8%) were also common, but the reported rates may be underestimated because the studies did not always carry out appropriate investigations. Heart attacks (1.7%) and strokes (1.2%) were reported less often. Blood tests also often suggested heart damage or stress. The studies focused on people in hospital, with severe COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people who had milder COVID-19 who were not hospitalised. The studies were very different from each other and did not always report the results in the same way or use the most reliable methods. Accordingly, our confidence in the precision of the prevalence of pre-existing disease and of cardiovascular complications is not high.
We plan to update this review. However, in future, we will focus only on higher-quality evidence to increase the strength of our findings.
In this updated review, we identified 10 studies involving a total of 1015 participants. We did not find any well-designed randomized controlled trial evidence to support the use of these medications. Trials of antioxidants identified in this review were generally of poor methodological quality and lacked statistical power. However, antioxidants are generally well tolerated without serious adverse effects.
This review searched for high quality research studies to try to determine the effects of using email for coordinating healthcare appointments and attendance reminders, on patients, healthcare professionals and health services. This included research studies where patients could make appointments, receive reminders about their healthcare appointments and coordinate any future appointments. We did not find any studies that examined these questions and so we cannot present any results. We recommend that high-quality research is carried out to examine the use of email for this purpose.
This review included 10 studies and 510 patients. All studies included a similar population of people with non-specific low back pain. The studies only included participants with chronic low back pain. The duration of the treatment programmes in the included trials ranged from 10 days to 90 days. The duration of follow-up varied from four weeks to six months. None of the included studies measured follow-up beyond six months. The sample sizes ranged from 17 to 87 participants. The included studies demonstrated that Pilates is probably more effective than minimal intervention in the short and intermediate term for pain and disability outcomes, and more effective than minimal intervention for improvement in function and global impression of recovery in the short term. Pilates is probably not more effective than other exercises for pain and disability in the short and intermediate term. For function, other exercises were more effective than Pilates at intermediate-term follow-up, but not at short-term follow-up. Thus, while there is some evidence for the effectiveness of Pilates for low back pain, there is no conclusive evidence that it is superior to other forms of exercise. Minor or no adverse events were reported for the interventions in this review. The overall quality of the evidence in this review ranged from low to moderate.
The review found that wearing a helmet reduced the risk of head or brain injury by approximately two-thirds or more, regardless of whether the crash involved a motor vehicle. Injuries to the mid and upper face were also markedly reduced, although helmets did not prevent lower facial injuries.
The review of trials found that immunotherapy can reduce asthma symptoms, the need for medications and the risk of severe asthma attacks after future exposure to the allergen. It is possibly as effective as inhaled steroids. However, there is an increased risk of a lump at the injection site, rash, wheezing, breathlessness and very rarely a fatal allergic reaction.
We wanted to know the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on men with erection problems. We conducted a comprehensive search for studies involving men with low testosterone levels. These studies compared the effects of testosterone with placebo or other medications aimed at improving erections. We included 43 studies, with 11,419 participants, which compared testosterone with a placebo, but also studies comparing it to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (a group of medications to improve erections). We also found studies where both groups (testosterone and placebo) received phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors. In the short term, testosterone, when compared to a placebo, shows minor changes in erectile function, sexual quality of life, and cardiovascular mortality.
When we looked only at studies with robust methods, the results remained consistent: there was little to no effect on erectile function and sexual quality of life. The data suggest that cardiovascular mortality is also unlikely to be significantly impacted.
However, in the long term, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on erectile dysfunction. Unfortunately, no studies provided information on sexual quality of life or cardiovascular mortality outcomes in the long term. The certainty of the evidence is moderate for most of the short-term outcomes, meaning that we are moderately confident that the result is likely to be close to the true effect. For the long-term outcomes, we have very limited certainty due to the lack of robust evidence, and further research might alter these conclusions. The latest information is current as of 29 August 2023.
We searched the databases until June 2013, and included 22 studies involving 1732 patients of whom 842 had an infraclavicular block and 930 had brachial plexus blockade with another technique. These other techniques were axillary block (injection in the armpit area; 14 studies), supraclavicular block (injection in the area just above the collarbone; six studies), mid-humeral block (injection in the upper arm; two studies) and parascalene block (injection in the lower neck area; one study). One study compared an infraclavicular block with both an axillary block and a supraclavicular block. The infraclavicular block had a high success rate and was as good as all other blocks in providing anaesthesia of the lower arm. Advantages of the infraclavicular block included a reduced risk of pain from the tourniquet applied to the upper arm during surgery and a faster performance time (four minutes on average) compared to more complex techniques of axillary or mid-humeral block that used three or four separate injections (instead of just one). Side-effects were uncommon, and no difference was seen between the infraclavicular block and all other blocks in this regard.
In conclusion, this review showed that the infraclavicular block is an effective and safe choice for producing anaesthesia of the lower arm.
Whether surgery is performed through a cut in the abdomen or a cut through the anus (known as a perineal approach), it makes no difference with regard to reappearance of the prolapse or appearance of postoperative complications. When surgeons perform the operation through a small hole in the abdomen (laparoscopic or keyhole surgery) recovery may be faster than for open abdominal surgery. When constipation is one of the main symptoms, bowel resection (removing part of the bowel) during prolapse repair may help. There was no difference in the results when different types of repair were used during the perineal (anal) approach. There was no particular concern about different types of surgery described in this review. Although 15 studies were included in this review, many of them had different comparisons and some had poor methods, limiting the usefulness of the findings. However, longer follow-up of patients in these studies, together with results from ongoing trials, may provide some information in the future.
We found seven studies in 2130 people with infertility. Only one study also included male partners. The studies were conducted in Canada, Iran, The Netherlands, UK, and USA. Three studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with routine care or attention control. Four studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on one topic (weight, alcohol intake, or smoking) with routine care in women with infertility and specific lifestyle characteristics.  Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may not affect live birth. The evidence suggests that if live birth is assumed to be 48% for those receiving routine care or attention control, then live birth when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 38% and 53%. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics affects lifestyle behaviour changes such as body mass index (BMI) in women, vegetable intake in men and women, or alcohol abstinence and smoking cessation in men. Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may not affect adequate use of folic acid supplement, alcohol abstinence, or smoking cessation in women. The evidence suggests that if adequate folic acid supplement use in women is assumed to be 93% for those receiving routine care or attention control, then adequate folic acid supplement use when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 89% and 94%. Evidence also suggests that if it is assumed that 75% of women abstain from alcohol with routine care or attention control, then between 74% and 88% of women would abstain from alcohol when receiving preconception lifestyle advice. If it is assumed that smoking cessation is seen in 95% of women receiving routine care or attention control, then smoking cessation would be seen in 93% to 99% of women when they receive preconception lifestyle advice. No study reported on other behavioural changes. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight for women with infertility and obesity affects live birth or adverse events (including gestational diabetes and hypertension) and miscarriage. Regarding behavioural changes, preconception lifestyle advice on weight may slightly reduce BMI, but we are uncertain whether it affects other behavioural changes: percentage of weight loss, vegetable and fruit intake, alcohol intake, and total moderate to vigorous physical activity. No study reported on other behavioural changes. In at-risk drinking women with infertility, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake affects live birth or miscarriage. One study reported behavioural changes in alcohol intake but not as defined in the Review methods. No study reported on any other outcome. One study reported on preconception lifestyle advice with a focus on behavioural changes for smoking cessation in women with infertility who smoke, but not as defined in the Review methods. No study reported on any other outcome. The evidence was of low to very low quality. The main limitations of the evidence were poor study methods in included studies (lack of blinding) and lack of (precision in) findings for live birth, safety outcomes, and reported behavioural changes.
We searched for evidence on 27 January 2021 and identified 11 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 4895 women and their 5975 babies who remained at risk of early birth more than seven days after an initial course of corticosteroids between 23 and 34 weeks' gestation at trial enrolment.
Overall, these trials showed that repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids reduced the risk of the baby having breathing difficulties, including severe difficulties, and serious health problems in the first few weeks after birth (moderate to high quality and low risk of bias evidence). There was probably no effect on chronic lung disease (usually defined by persistent breathing difficulty and need for oxygen treatment at the age they would have reached 36 weeks of pregnancy). The data available could not confirm if there was an increase, decrease or no change in the combination of fetal or newborn or infant death under one year of age, severe bleeding in the brain or severe bowel inflammation.
For the women, there was no increase in the likelihood of a caesarean birth but it was uncertain if there was an increase or decrease in maternal death, maternal infection, risk of maternal side effects or the need to stop treatment due to side effects. No trials reported data for breastfeeding at the time of leaving hospital or risk of the woman being admitted to the intensive care unit.
In five trials that follow the babies up to early childhood, there were no long-term benefits or harms on later development. Similarly, the two trials that follow children up to mid-childhood (five years in one trial and six to eight years in another trial) found no long-term benefits or harms to development. For early and mid-childhood follow-up it was unclear if the total deaths after randomisation up to the time of follow-up were increased, decreased or the same.
The evidence on which these statements were based was generally of moderate or high quality. Most results were based on information with low risk of bias or some concerns of risk of bias. This review shows that a repeat dose of prenatal corticosteroids given to women who remain at risk of an early birth after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids helps the baby's lungs and reduces serious health problems in the first few weeks of life without harm on health or development up to mid-childhood. Further research is needed on the long-term benefits or harms for the baby into adulthood.
Two randomised studies, with moderate overall quality of evidence, comparing deferasirox to deferoxamine were identified. The evidence is current to 02 August 2013. The studies with 203 and 212 participants lasted for 12 months and 24 weeks, respectively. Only little data on patient-important outcomes such as mortality (limited by a short study follow up) and end-organ damage (incidence of diabetes mellitus) were available. Iron removal, as measured by the surrogate marker serum ferritin was significantly greater with deferoxamine. In one study, both drugs were reported to work equally well in reducing liver iron concentration.
The safety of deferasirox was acceptable; the main side effects when compared to deferoxamine were increased frequency of nausea, diarrhoea and rash as well as a mean increase of creatinine, while adverse events of any kind were observed more often in people treated with deferoxamine. Patient satisfaction and compliance with therapy was significantly greater with deferasirox. The overall quality of evidence rated according to the GRADE criteria was moderate due to issues with study design. For four outcomes, namely liver iron concentration, serum ferritin, creatinine increase and satisfaction with treatment, it was judged as 'moderate' quality; for one outcome (discontinuations) was judged as 'low' quality. In summary, the evidence from the two included studies suggests that deferasirox is similarly effective as deferoxamine depending on the appropriate ratio of doses of deferoxamine and deferasirox being compared. In the short term, deferasirox appears to have an acceptable safety profile, but there are no comparative data based on randomised controlled trials available looking at long-term safety. Further data on long-term efficacy on patient-relevant outcomes and long-term adverse effects are needed to decide whether deferasirox should be used as alternative to the first-line option of deferoxamine. Currently, its use seems to be mainly warranted as a treatment option for people with sickle cell disease who cannot tolerate or comply with deferoxamine.
This review examined 19 studies with 1496 participants to see whether there is a difference in effectiveness between conventional and newer antibiotics. This review found no differences. Adverse effects in both approaches were similar, except for diarrhoea, which was more common in the cephalosporin group. Only three studies dealt with adults; the remaining studies recruited participants aged 15 years and younger. Therefore, we believe that the results probably pertain more to children. Conventional and newer antibiotics seem reasonable options for initial, immediate treatment. The choice may depend on availability, affordability and local policies.
We wanted to know which types of medication were effective in reducing behaviours of concern in people with ASD and whether they caused unwanted effects. We searched for studies that investigated any medication used to manage behaviours of concern. Studies compared the medication with placebo (a dummy medication) or another medication. People in the studies could be adults or children, but all had ASD with behaviours of concern. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 131 studies with 7014 people. Most studies involved children, although some studies involved both children and adults, or adults only. Studies looked at a wide range of medications, including those usually used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), convulsions, emotional problems, heart and lungs, dementia, Parkinson's, and anxiety.
Atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics are usually used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. They probably reduce irritability, but they may have little to no effect on aggression and self-injury. People receiving antipsychotics might be more likely to experience unwanted effects such as increased appetite, dizziness, sedation (slowed thought and movement), sleepiness, tiredness and tremor compared to those receiving no treatment or other medications. People receiving antipsychotics may be no more or less likely than those receiving placebo to experience other unwanted effects.
Neurohormones (such as oxytocin and secretin) may have a minimal to small effect on irritability but no studies reported data for the effects of neurohormones on self-harm or aggression. People receiving neurohormones may be no more or less likely than those receiving placebo to experience unwanted effects.
ADHD-related medications may reduce irritability but may have no effect on self-injury. No studies reported data for aggression. People receiving ADHD-related medications might be more likely to experience unwanted effects such as drowsiness, tiredness, headache, difficulties sleeping, and decreased appetite. But they may be no more or less likely than those receiving placebo to experience other unwanted effects.
Antidepressants may have little to no effect on irritability. No studies reported useful data for aggression and self-injury. People receiving antidepressants might be more likely to experience unwanted effects such as impulsive behaviour and making repetitive movements or sounds (stereotypy) compared to placebo. But they may be no more or less likely than those receiving placebo to experience other types of unwanted effects. Most of the studies lasted less than 3 months, and very few studies involved adults. Therefore, we are uncertain if the same effects would be seen over a longer period of time or in adults. The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to June 2022.
this review is up-to-date to August 2017. We included 11 trials involving 38,742 participants: eight trials assessed the effect of blood pressure drugs, and three trials compared different blood pressure targets. Ten studies were hospital-based and one trial was performed in a general practitioner setting. Not all trials contributed information to all outcomes. blood pressure drugs lowered the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a stroke or TIA, whereas there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether they reduce the risk of other blood vessel diseases and dementia. There is also insufficient evidence to conclude which blood pressure target is best for patients with a stroke or TIA. overall, the quality of the trials in this review was moderate. However, we found similar results in an analysis using only high-quality trials. More research is needed to investigate whether blood pressure drugs also prevent dementia, and what blood pressure targets are best for patients with a stroke or TIA.
This review compared any type of respiratory muscle training with standard care or sham treatments. We reviewed 11 studies (including 212 people with cervical spinal cord injury) and suggested that for people with cervical spinal cord injury there is a small beneficial effect of respiratory muscle training on lung volume and on the strength of the muscles used to take a breath in and to breathe air out and cough. No effect was seen on the maximum amount of air that can be pushed out in one breath, or shortness of breath. An insufficient number of studies had examined the effect of respiratory muscle training on the frequency of lung infections or quality of life, so we could not assess these outcomes in the review. We identified no adverse effects of training the breathing muscles for people with a cervical spinal cord injury.
Meta-analysis is a statistical technique to combine results from separate research studies. A meta-analysis can be performed using summary data published in a study report, referred to as aggregate data (AD), or using data collected on each individual participant in the study, referred to as individual participant data (IPD). A meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD-MA) can take longer and be more expensive than a meta-analysis of aggregate data (AD-MA), but the IPD-MA can be more reliable and can answer much more detailed questions than an AD-MA.
We searched for studies, published up to 7 January 2016, that compared results of IPD-MA with AD-MA. We found that four times out of five, similar conclusions can be drawn, but in one out of five cases the two different types of meta-analyses gave different results and conclusions. As we could not reliably identify when an IPD-MA and AD-MA will differ most using these studies, we recommend that an AD-MA should be done first before doing an IPD-MA. If there are shortcomings with the AD-MA, researchers should then consider the possible benefits of IPD whilst remembering the extra work involved.
In total, 20 trials were included. Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low due to serious risk of bias and very small size of included trials. There was no clear difference in improvement between benzodiazepines and placebo, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics or benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics and benzodiazepines alone or antipsychotic alone. When benzodiazepines were compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines, there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepine alone but the evidence was of low quality. Only one study showed lower effect of combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics versus combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. However, the evidence was of very low quality. In terms of side effects, people receiving benzodiazepines compared to antipsychotics had lower risk of presenting with symptoms such as shaking, tremors and slurred speech whereas the results for the sedation caused were unclear. The existing trials are not informative enough to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines alone or in additional to other medicines when urgent tranquillisation or sedation with medicines is required. Although benzodiazepines alone may cause fewer side effects compared to older antipsychotics, when they are added on to other medicines this may lead to unnecessary side effects. Further studies are needed to provide good-quality evidence with robust conclusions to inform clinical practice and policies around rapid tranquillisation for people with psychoses who are aggressive or agitated.
The evidence is current to 30 January 2018. We included studies assessing the accuracy of stroke recognition scales when applied to adults suspected of stroke out of hospital.
We included 23 studies evaluating the following scales: Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS; 11 studies), Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER; eight studies), Face Arm Speech Time (FAST; five studies), Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Scale (LAPSS; five studies), Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Scale (MASS; three studies), Ontario Prehospital Stroke Screening Tool (OPSST; one study), Medic Prehospital Assessment for Code Stroke (MedPACS; one study) and PreHospital Ambulance Stroke Test (PreHAST; one study). Nine studies compared two or more scales in the same people. The results from five studies were combined to estimate the accuracy of ROSIER in the emergency room (ER) and five studies to estimate the accuracy of LAPSS when used by ambulance clinicians. Many of the studies were of poor or unclear quality and we could not be sure that their results were valid. Studies differed considerably in terms of included participants and other characteristics. As a consequence, studies evaluating the same scale reported variable results.
We combined five studies evaluating ROSIER in the ER and obtained average sensitivity of 88% (88 out of 100 people with stroke/TIA will test positive on ROSIER). We were unable to obtain an estimate of specificity (how many people without stroke/TIA will test negative).
We also combined the results for LAPSS, but the included studies were of poor quality and the results may not be valid. The rest of the scales were evaluated in a smaller number of studies or the results were too variable to be combined statistically.
A small number of studies compared two or more scales when applied to the same participants. Such studies are more likely to produce valid results as the scales are used in the same circumstances. They reported that in the ER, ROSIER and FAST had similar accuracy, but ROSIER was evaluated in more studies. When used by ambulance staff, CPSS identified more people with stroke/TIA in all studies, but also more people without stroke/TIA tested positive. Current evidence suggests that CPSS should be used by ambulance clinicians in the field. Further research is needed to estimate the proportion of wrong results and whether alternatives scales, such as MASS and ROSIER, which might have comparable sensitivity but higher specificity, should be used instead to achieve better overall accuracy. In the ER, ROSIER should be the test of choice. In a group of 100 people of whom 62 have stroke/TIA, the test will miss on average seven people with stroke/TIA (ranging from three to 16). Because of the small number of studies evaluating the tests in a specific setting, poor quality, substantial differences in study characteristics and variability in results, these findings should be treated with caution and need further verification in better-designed studies.
This review compared the effectiveness of two different surgical techniques in reducing these complications. The surgical techniques were diathermy (the use of high-frequency electrical current to cut tissue, remove the tonsil and control blood loss) and traditional cold dissection (where the tonsil is cut away and blood loss then controlled with ties, stitches or diathermy). Two studies (254 patients) are included in the review. The review of trials found that there is not enough evidence to demonstrate that diathermy is more effective than dissection. There was some evidence that patients who had diathermy tonsillectomy had less bleeding during the operation but more pain afterwards, however more research is needed.
Many of the 39 studies assessed in this review enrolled only a small number of patients and date back to before 1990. The novel drug alvimopan shortened bowel recovery, but many studies failed to report methodology according to current guidelines. Erythromycin, cholecystokinin, cisapride, dopamine-antagonists, propranolol or vasopressin are not supported due to lack of evidence or absence of effect. Intravenous lidocaine and neostigmine might show to be beneficial, but more evidence is needed.
Eight trials (1753 patients) met the criteria for inclusion in this review. The addition of chemotherapy to standard radiotherapy provides a small but significant benefit in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer, especially when chemotherapy is administered at the same time as radiotherapy. The role of chemotherapy given before or after the radiotherapy is more questionable.
We searched for randomised controlled trials that were published or registered before 7 January 2020. We included 32 trials with 5356 participants. Trial participants were 16 to 78 years old and had acute low back pain. Study length varied from one day to six months. The studies took place in many different countries. More than half of the studies was done in Europe and North-America. NSAIDs were slightly more effective than placebo for pain reduction in the first three weeks. On average, the pain intensity decreased by 7.3 points on a 100-point scale. This means there was a small difference between the two treatments, but it was not clinically relevant. People receiving NSAIDs also scored 2.0 points better on a 24-point disability scale than those receiving placebo. This is unlikely to be of real-world benefit. There was a similar number of side effects between people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo. However, the type of studies that we investigated are not designed to find side effects. Therefore, we should be careful about drawing conclusions based upon these findings.
We also compared two different types of NSAIDs; non-selective NSAIDs versus COX-2 inhibitors. We found no clear differences in effect. There was also a similar number of reported side effects of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or stomach symptoms. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing short-term pain, and high quality evidence that they are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing disability in acute low back pain. The magnitude of the effect is very small.
We searched for studies on 14 May 2016. We included 11 randomised controlled trials involving 1487 mothers and their babies (but only eight trials contributed data to our analyses). The evidence was limited by the quality and number of studies and we advise caution when looking at the results.
The criteria for diagnosis of GDM and treatment targets varied between studies, and each outcome is based on few studies with low numbers of women. Three studies compared oral medication with placebo/standard care but the following findings are from a single study (375 women). The quality of the evidence was very low or low. We found no differences between the oral medication and placebo group for the risk of high blood pressure, birth by caesarean section, induction of labour or perineal trauma. The number of babies born large-for-gestational age, with low blood sugars or dying at birth was not clearly different between the groups. Two studies (434 women) reported no difference in the need for insulin between the oral medication and placebo group.
Six studies compared metformin with glibenclamide. The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate. We found no difference between metformin and glibenclamide for the risk of high blood pressure (three studies, 508 women, moderate-quality evidence), birth by caesarean section (four studies, 554 women, low-quality evidence), perineal trauma (two studies, 308 women, low-quality evidence) or induction of labour (one study, 159 women, low-quality evidence). We found no difference between metformin and glibenclamide for the baby having low blood sugars (four studies, 554 infants, low-quality evidence), being born large-for-gestational age (two studies, 246 infants) or dying at birth (all low- or very low-quality evidence). In one study, the babies of the mothers taking metformin were at reduced risk of having any serious outcome (low blood sugar, jaundice, being born large, breathing problems, injury at birth or death combined) (low-quality evidence). One small study (43 women) comparing glibenclamide with acarbose reported no differences in outcomes for mothers or their babies.
None of the included studies provided any data on many of the outcomes pre-specified in this review, including long-term outcomes for the mother or for the baby as a child or an adult. There is not enough high-quality evidence available to guide us on if oral medication has better outcomes for women with gestational diabetes, and their babies, compared with a placebo or if one oral medication has better health outcomes than another oral medication. Because we are still unclear, further research is needed. Future studies should be encouraged to report on the outcomes suggested in this review and in particular the long-term outcomes for the woman and the infant that have been poorly reported to date.
We found eight trials with a total of 1183 participants to include in the review. Five trials provided CCT for three months, two for four months, and one for six months. We compared CCT with other activities, such as watching educational videos, and with no activity. We looked for effects on overall cognitive function and on specific cognitive functions, such as memory and thinking speed. All of the included studies had some design problems, which could have biased the results. Overall, we thought the quality of the evidence that we found was low or very low. This means we cannot be confident in the results, and that future research might well find something different. CCT may slightly improve overall cognitive function after 12 weeks of training; however, we found no evidence of a persistent effect 12 months after the intervention. We were unable to comment or found little evidence that CCT when compared with other activities may have a relevant effect on most of the specific cognitive functions that we examined. The longest trial found that compared to doing nothing, completing six months of CCT may have had a beneficial effect on memory. None of the included trials reported effects of cognitive training on quality of life or on daily activities, and none reported harmful effects of training. Compared to other activities, CCT may lead to slightly better overall cognitive function at the end of 12 weeks of training, but we found no evidence that the effect persists a year later. Compared to doing nothing, CCT may slightly improve memory at the end of six months of training. Although we excluded trials with less than 12 weeks of training, the trials that we included were still quite short for examining long-term effects as people age. A limitation of our review is that we did not include some trials with shorter training periods that did look for long-lasting effects, so it is possible that we missed some useful evidence. Many published studies have looked at computer training. Making sense of this substantial literature is difficult. It may be more helpful in the future to categorise trials by the duration of effects of training rather than by the duration of the training itself.
This review found no randomised controlled trial evidence on screening for PAD. High quality research is required to help healthcare providers decide whether screening for PAD in asymptomatic and undiagnosed individuals is effective in terms of reduction of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (for example myocardial infarction and stroke), morbidity from PAD (intermittent claudication, amputation, reduced walking distance) and improvement in quality of life.
We included randomized controlled trials involving adults undergoing any type of cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia with or without cardiopulmonary bypass where researchers compared epidural pain relief around the time of surgery against other forms of pain relief. Surgeries performed were coronary artery bypass grafting or valvular procedures and surgeries for congenital heart disease. The average age of participants was between 43 and 75 years. Outcomes were measured up to one year after surgery.
We included 69 studies with 4860 participants. Where stated, the studies were funded by governmental resources (five studies), charity (eight), institutional resources (23), or in part by the industry (two). In all, 31 trials did not mention the source of funding. The evidence is current to November 2018. When researchers compared epidural analgesia versus systemic pain relief (e.g. by an analgesic given directly into a vein), they could not detect any difference in the number of deaths in the first 30 days after surgery (38 studies, 3418 participants). There might be a difference in the number of people experiencing heart attacks (26 studies, 2713 participants). These findings were supported by low-quality evidence. We found a small reduction in the risk of respiratory depression with epidural pain relief (21 studies, 1736 participants), but not in the risk of pneumonia (10 studies, 1107 participants) (low- or moderate-quality evidence). The reduced risk of respiratory depression was more obvious when cardiopulmonary bypass was needed for cardiac surgery. Epidural analgesia reduced the risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter early in recovery at zero to two weeks (18 studies, 2431 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The number of cerebrovascular accidents was not clearly different (18 studies, 2232 participants), and no lasting neurological complications or epidural haematomas were reported (53 studies, 3982 participants; very low- or low-quality evidence). Although epidural analgesia may have reduced the duration of tracheal intubation, this was noted mainly in older studies, and clinical practices have changed since that time (40 trials, 3353 participants; moderate-quality evidence).
We found only six studies that compared epidural pain relief versus application of local anaesthetic on the body surface to produce peripheral nerve blocks directly into the space around the lungs (intrapleural analgesia) and onto the surgical wound (wound infiltration). These studies provided low- or very low-quality evidence and did not report on many of the outcomes for this review. Study authors reported no heart attacks and no epidural haematomas. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, low, or very low. We included too few participants in our review to rule out any differences in the number of patient deaths between epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia, nor to see any increase in epidural haematomas.
We wanted to know if fluvoxamine reduces death, severity of disease, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, if it has an effect on quality of life, or causes any unwanted effects. We included studies that compared fluvoxamine to placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, usual care, or any other treatment for COVID-19 that is known to work to some extent, such as remdesivir or dexamethasone. We excluded treatments that we know do not work for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, or have an unknown effect on the disease.
We evaluated the effects of fluvoxamine in adults with COVID-19 on:
• people dying;
• whether people needed to be treated in a hospital;
• whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better or worse;
• unwanted effects;
• quality of life;
• and whether there is a risk of suicide or suicide attempt when taking this medication. We searched for studies that investigated fluvoxamine as a treatment for adults with COVID-19 in hospital or as outpatients. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as study methods and study sizes. We found two studies that investigated fluvoxamine as an early treatment for mild COVID-19 in 1649 self-isolated people at home (outpatients). All studies compared fluvoxamine to placebo together with standard care. The studies used different durations of treatment (10 or 15 days).
We found five ongoing studies and two studies that are awaiting classification. We did not find any studies that investigated the effect of fluvoxamine on people in hospital with COVID-19. • Compared to placebo, fluvoxamine may slightly reduce the number of people who die in the 28 days after starting treatment (2 studies, 1649 people).
• Compared to placebo, fluvoxamine may reduce number of people who are admitted to a hospital or who die before hospital admission (2 studies, 1649 people).
•The number of unwanted (serious) events did not clearly differ between fluvoxamine and placebo treatment (2 studies, 1649 people).
•Neither of the studies reported on quality of life, the time needed until all initial symptoms resolved, or suicide attempts. We cannot be confident in the current evidence for fluvoxamine in treating people with COVID-19, mainly due to the lack of studies that are currently available and some flaws in study design. We will continue to search for new studies to complete the current evidence gap.
It would also be important to find out the effects of a medication such as fluvoxamine on long-Covid. We are currently waiting for research on this to become available in the near future.
Unfortunately, the studies available did not focus on children and young adults, women who are planning or trying to conceive, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, older adults, or those people who have a weakened immune system (immunocompromised people). Likewise, no information was available on whether women or men were more likely to benefit from fluvoxamine. The evidence is current to February 2022.
We included a single study with 11 reports that focused on results for different outcomes. The participants of the included study were 46 children aged 8 to 18 years recruited from the clinic of a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia who were diagnosed with long-term constipation either based on their symptoms and/or X-ray studies. The studies divided the patients into two groups, one receiving the actual TES , with electrodes placed on their belly and electrical current running, and the other receiving sham stimulation, with identical device administered but without the electrical current. The participants were followed-up for up to four years, although only outcome information up until the follow-up period of two months were available in this review. The study was funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and Murdoch Children's Research Institute Theme Investment Grants. There was not enough information on certain aspects of the trial methodologies from the reports gathered, although it was clear that the physiotherapists who administered the TES treatment or sham treatment were aware of which group the patients were allocated to. The knowledge of the participants' allocated group might have influenced the way the actual and sham therapies were administered, as well as the way some of the outcome data, such as symptoms of constipation and soiling and quality of life, might have been reported by the therapist as well as the patients and their carers. This raised concerns regarding the overall methodological quality of the study.
The very low quality evidence for all of the results means that we are uncertain about the effects of TES when compared with sham stimulation. Overall, there were no differences between children who received TES and sham stimulation in the number of children with improved complete spontaneous bowel movements, improved bowel movements (as assessed by X-Ray with special contrast), improved symptoms related to soiling and quality of life. There were also no differences between the two groups in the average change in the quality of life scores after the therapy, as assessed by the children themselves as well as their parents. The only difference noted was in mean bowel transit rate, namely, distance travelled by the radioactive substance along the bowel, in which children who received TES had their radioactive substance slightly further down their bowel compared to children who received a sham stimulation. However, it was unclear whether such a difference in distance travelled in the bowel translated to any meaningful differences in defaecation and constipation-related symptoms. No side effects were reported in the study. Overall, this study included a small number of patients and we had concerns regarding the methods resulting in very low quality evidence for all the outcomes assessed. The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and side effects of TES in children with chronic constipation can be drawn. Further studies assessing TES for the management of constipation are needed. We suggest that future research should provide clear documentation on specific methods in the conduct of the trials, and include outcomes that are important for patients, such as spontaneous or complete bowel movements or improvement in constipation-related symptoms along with assessments of quality of life.
We included seven small studies with a total of 384 people with non-specific LBP of varying durations. Three studies (168 people) separately showed that LLLT was more effective at reducing pain in the short-term (less than three months), and intermediate-term (six months) than sham (fake) laser. However, the strength and number of treatments were varied and the amount of the pain reduction was small. Three studies (102 people) separately reported that LLLT with exercise was not better than exercise alone or exercise plus sham in short-term pain reduction.
One study (56 people) showed that LLLT was more effective than sham at reducing disability in the short term. Three studies (102 people) compared LLLT plus exercise with exercise plus sham or exercise alone and did not show significant reduction in disability. Two studies (90 people) separately reported that LLLT was not more effective at reducing disability than exercise alone or exercise plus sham in the short-term.
Based on these small trials, with different populations, LLLT doses and comparison groups, there are insufficient data to either support or refute the effectiveness of LLLT for the treatment of LBP. We were unable to determine optimal dose, application techniques or length of treatment with the available evidence. Larger trials that look specifically at these questions are required.
We identified one randomised controlled trial, which involved people with a penetrating injury to the chest. In this study, 44 people (mostly male and with similar characteristics in terms of type of injury) were given either their own reprocessed blood (through cell salvage) or standard care using donated blood. The study was conducted at a hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2002. Results indicated no important differences between the two groups of participants with regard to survival, postoperative infection, or cost. There was a reduction in the amount of banked blood (blood that has been donated and stored) required for transfusion within the first 24 hours following injury among people receiving cell salvage. Data on other adverse events were not reported.
We believe that larger, multicentre, methodologically rigorous trials are needed to assess the relative efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of cell salvage in trauma surgery and other surgical procedures. The quality of the one study identified was high, but the number of participants was not large. No firm conclusions can be drawn as to the safety and effectiveness of cell salvage in individuals undergoing abdominal or thoracic trauma surgery.
We ran an electronic search in 10 February 2021 for trials that randomly assigned people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses to participate in structured aggression or violence risk assessment methods, or to standard treatment. Four trials met the review requirements and provided useable data. The trials compared the effects of structured risk assessment with standard professional care. The results suggest that use of structured aggression or violence risk assessment is likely better at reducing severe aggression events at psychiatric hospital than standard professional care; however, the evidence is not strong. In addition, there is no clear evidence that structured risk assessment is better at reducing numbers of people that are subjected to coercive measures (seclusion room) or the length of time people are placed in a seclusion room; however, these results were based on low-certainty evidence. There was no evidence of a clear effect of structured risk assessment on adverse effects compared to standard professional care. There was no available evidence on satisfaction with treatment, service use, adverse events (death), or leaving the study early. The evidence identified in this review is limited and of moderate to very low certainty, therefore no firm conclusions can be drawn. High-quality trials focusing on outcomes that are relevant and important to patients and carers are needed.
We included eight studies in this review (current until April 2017). The studies included a total of 3680 participants. Participants received either LMWH subcutaneously once daily, or no preventive treatment or placebo. New cases of DVT ranged from 4.3% to 40% in the control groups and ranged from 0% to 37% in the LMWH groups. The risk of DVT was lower in participants who received LMWH. Further analysis also showed a reduction in the occurrence of DVT when the use of LMWH was compared to no treatment or placebo in the following groups of participants: patients with below-knee casts, conservatively treated patients (patients not operated), operated patients, patients with fractures, patients with soft-tissue injuries, patients with above-knee thrombosis, and patients with below-knee thrombosis. No clear differences were found between the LMWH and control groups for pulmonary embolism. The studies showed less symptomatic venous thromboembolism in the LMWH groups compared with the control groups. No cases of death due to pulmonary embolism were reported. One study reported one death in the control group.
There were few reported adverse effects in the treated patients. The main adverse events reported were cases of minor bleeding such as nose bleeds, blood in urine and dark stool. The use of LMWH in adult patients reduced DVT when immobilization of the lower limb was required, compared with no prevention or placebo. The quality of the evidence was downgraded to moderate due to risks of bias in some trials, such as lack of blinding of participants, or unclear reasons for excluding participants from the analyses. Low-quality evidence showed no clear differences in pulmonary embolism between LMWH and the control groups, but fewer symptomatic venous thromboemboli in the LMWH groups. The quality of evidence was downgraded due to methodological issues and imprecision of the results.
The evidence from this review, which included findings from 29 randomised controlled trials (4974 participants in total), suggests that mirtazapine is likely to have a faster onset of action than the most frequently used type of antidepressants, which are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It would appear that mirtazapine is superior to SSRIs at the end of treatment over 6 to 12 weeks. Mirtazapine causes adverse events that lead to a similar frequency of dropouts as SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, although adverse event profile of mirtazapine is unique. Mirtazapine is likely to cause weight gain or increased appetite and somnolence but is less likely to cause nausea or vomiting and sexual dysfunction than SSRIs.
We included 46 trials involving 10,832 women from 21 countries. The studies included pregnant women or women who had delivered their baby within the last three months, and who reported leakage of urine, faeces, both urine or faeces, or no leakage. They were allocated randomly to receive PFMT (either to try to prevent incontinence or as a treatment for incontinence) or not, and the effects were compared. Twenty-five studies were publicly funded, one of which received grants from both public and private sources. Three studies received no funding and 18 did not declare their funding sources. Pregnant women without urine leakage who did PFMT to prevent leakage: women probably report less urine leakage in late pregnancy and the risk is slightly less at three to six months after childbirth. There was not enough information to determine whether these effects continued beyond the first year after the baby's birth.
Women with urine leakage, pregnant or after birth, who did PFMT as a treatment: there is no evidence that doing PFMT during pregnancy reduced leakage in late pregnancy or in the year following childbirth.
Women with or without urine leakage (mixed group), pregnant or after birth, who did PFMT to either prevent or treat leakage: women who began exercising during pregnancy probably have slightly less leakage in late pregnancy which may continue up to six months after birth. There is no evidence of effect at one year following birth. For women who started exercising after delivery, the effect on leakage one year after birth was uncertain.
Leakage of faeces: only eight studies had evidence about leakage of faeces. One year after delivery, it was uncertain if PFMT helped decrease leakage of faeces in women who started exercising following childbirth. For women with or without leakage of faeces (mixed group) who started PFMT while pregnant, there was no evidence of a difference in faeces leakage in late pregnancy; for those who started PFMT after delivery there was no evidence of a decrease in leakage up to one year after birth.
There was little information about how PFMT may affect leakage-related quality of life. There were two reports of pelvic floor pain but no other harmful effects of PFMT were noted.
There was no evidence about whether or not PFMT was cost-effective. Overall, studies were small and most had design problems, including limited details on how women were randomly allocated into groups and poor reporting of measurements. Some of the problems were expected because it was impossible to blind health professionals or women to whether they were exercising or not. The PFMT differed considerably between studies and was often poorly described. The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate.
A total of 262 infants born preterm have been enrolled in two studies of early versus late administration of EPO to prevent blood transfusions. There were no demonstrable benefits of early versus late administration of EPO with regards to reduction in the use of red blood cell transfusions, number of transfusions, the amount of red cells transfused or number of donor exposures per infant. However, the use of early EPO compared with late EPO administration increases the risk of retinopathy of prematurity, a serious complication in babies born before term. Currently, there is a lack of evidence that either treatment confers any substantial benefits with regard to any donor blood exposure, as many infants enrolled in both studies were exposed to donor blood prior to study entry, and early EPO increases the risk of retinopathy of prematurity. Neither early nor late administration of EPO is recommended.
We found five randomised trials (trials in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) that included 220 adult participants with acute severe pancreatitis from India, Scotland, and the USA and that compared feeding via nasogastric versus nasojejunal tubes. The evidence is current to 17 October 2019. The results showed that there was little or no difference between routes of nasal feeding for death, success of feeding, and complications of feeding. The current evidence is insufficient to suggest that there is any advantage or disadvantage with either method of tube feeding in people with severe acute pancreatitis. The certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes. Our confidence in the evidence was reduced due to the small numbers of people studied, which led to imprecise results, and the methods used in some of the studies for diagnosis and treatment which differed from currently accepted methods.
Authors search medical databases and identified 19 randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 759 women that could be included in the review, but data from only nine trials were suitable for analyses. Women sought help for HMB when it affected their quality of life. Levels of prostaglandin (a naturally occurring hormone) are higher in women with HMB and are reduced by NSAIDs. The review of trials found that NSAIDs were modestly effective in reducing HMB, but other medicines, such as danazol, tranexamic acid and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS), are more effective. These results were based on a small number of low- to moderate-quality trials. The evidence quality ranged from low to moderate, the main limitations being poor reporting of study methods and imprecision resulting from small study numbers.
The aim of the present review was to evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressant treatment in acute AN. Seven small studies were identified; four placebo-controlled trials did not find evidence of efficacy of antidepressants in improving weight gain, eating disorder or associated symptoms, as well as differences in completion rates. Meta-analysis of data was not possible for most outcomes. However, major methodological limitations of these studies (e.g. insufficient power to detect differences) prevent from drawing definite conclusions or recommendations for antidepressant use in acute AN. Further studies testing safer antidepressants in larger and well designed trials are needed to guide clinical practice.
This review, which included searches of databases from January 1990 through March 31, 2014, found 58 community coalition-driven studies, which addressed a wide array of health outcomes and risk behaviors. Only studies of community coalitions with at least one racial or ethnic minority group representing the target population and at least two community-based public or private organizations were included. This review examined the effects of four types of strategies or interventions used by community coalitions.
Community system-level change strategies (such as initiatives targeting physical environments like housing, green spaces, neighborhood safety, or regulatory processes and policies) have produced small inconsistent effects; broad health and social care system-level strategies (such as programs targeting behavior of staff in a health or social care system, accessibility of services, or policies, procedures, and technologies designed to improve quality of care) have had consistently positive small effects; interventions that used lay community health outreach workers or group-based health education led by professional staff have produced fairly consistent positive effects; and group-based health education led by peers has had inconsistent effects.
This review shows that interventions led by community coalitions may connect health and human service providers with ethnic and racial minority communities in ways that benefit individual health outcomes and behaviors, as well as care delivery systems. However, to achieve the same levels of health across communities, regardless of race or ethnicity, we need to know specifically how a program does or does not work. This will require better information on how some programs described in this review brought about beneficial change and theresources needed, so they can be replicated. Furthermore, we need better scientific tools to improve our ability to identify effects of programs on whole community systems and to understand the leverage points that, when employed appropriately, shift the distribution of health toward equity.
Since the early statin randomised controlled trials were reported in the 1990s, several reviews of the effects of statins have been published highlighting their benefits particularly in people with a past history of CVD. Benefits include a reduction in CVD events. Statins have also been shown to reduce the risk of a first event in otherwise healthy individuals at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) but information on possible hazards has not been reported fully. The aim of this updated systematic review is to assess the effects, both in terms of benefits and harms of statins, for the primary prevention of CVD. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE until 2011. We found 18 randomised controlled trials with 19 trial arms (56,934 patients) dating from 1994 to 2008. All were randomised control trials comparing statins with usual care or placebo. The mean age of the participants was 57 years (range 28 - 97 years), 60.3% were men, and of the eight trials that reported on ethnicity, 85.9 % were Caucasian. Duration of treatment was a minimum one year and with follow-up of a minimum of six months. All-cause mortality and fatal and non-fatal CVD events were reduced with the use of statins as was the need for revascularisation (the restoration of an adequate blood supply to the heart) by means of surgery (coronary artery bypass graft ) or by angioplasty (PTCA). Of 1000 people treated with a statin for five years, 18 would avoid a major CVD event which compares well with other treatments used for preventing cardiovascular disease. Taking statins did not increase the risk of serious adverse effects such as cancer. Statins are likely to be cost-effective in primary prevention.
This review compares the different interface options for CPAP in patients with OSA. Four trials involving 132 people were included. Two studies compared nasal masks with an oral mask called the Oracle, and there did not appear to any significant differences between the two in terms of compliance, sleep study recordings, sleepiness or other symptoms of OSA. One study assessing nasal masks versus nasal pillows (consisting of prongs that rest within the nostrils) showed that patients using the nasal pillows had fewer overall side effects and reported greater satisfaction. The nose mask performed better than the face mask (which covers both the nose and mouth) with one study showing greater compliance and less sleepiness, and was the preferred mask in almost all patients. The choice of interface for a particular person will need to be tailored to the individual. Further trials comparing the many interfaces for CPAP in the treatment of OSA are needed.
The review of 10 studies (786 patients) found that mupirocin ointment reduced the risk of patients developing catheter-related bacteraemia (bacteria in the blood). However, monitoring of mupirocin resistance needs to be considered in future studies. There was not enough evidence to determine which ointment (povidone-iodine and polysporin) or dressing was the best in preventing infection. There was also insufficient evidence to support the use of medicinal honey for the prevention of infection.
This review assessed evidence from 1509 participants in 15 randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of naproxen or naproxen sodium (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. At doses equivalent to 500 mg and 400 mg, orally administered naproxen provides effective analgesia. About half of those treated experienced at least half pain relief over four to six hours, and the effects lasted, on average, up to nine hours. Associated adverse events did not differ from placebo, but these studies are of limited use for studying adverse effects.
We included in the data analyses five studies of people with stable asthma. We rated the overall quality of evidence as moderate for most outcomes, meaning that additional studies are likely to change our confidence in what we found. It looked as though people who stopped LABA might be more likely to have asthma attacks needing treatment with oral steroids, but this is uncertain. Over 17 weeks, 19 of 1000 people continuing their LABA had an attack, compared with 32 of 1000 who stopped taking LABA. This means that 13 more people in 1000 would have an attack if they stopped their LABA, but the uncertainty meant that between 3 fewer and 46 more could be affected.
Asthma control and asthma-related quality of life were a bit worse among people who stopped taking LABA, and we could not tell whether stopping LABA increased serious side effects or admission to the hospital.
We searched for evidence to March 21, 2016 and identified 41 trials for inclusion involving 2293 participants, with 22 trials involving 1339 participants contributing data for analysis. Trials came from many countries and involved mothers of infants in neonatal units and healthy infants at home. The findings did not indicate a clear preference for any one pump type. Mothers reported satisfaction with relaxation and support interventions. There was no difference in milk contamination between methods or breast/nipple soreness of mothers.
Greater milk volume was expressed when mothers listened to music or had a relaxation protocol, warmed the breast, massaged the breast, pumped frequently with a suitable breast shield size and started pumping milk sooner after birth if the infant was unable to feed at the breast. Hand expression or a large electric pump provided a higher protein content than a manual pump. Hand expression provided higher sodium and lower potassium compared to pumps. Fat/lipid content was higher with breast massage when pumping. No evidence of difference in energy content was found between methods. No study asked mothers if they had achieved their own goals for expressing milk. None of the studies examined costs involved with the methods. Of the studies that evaluated pumps or products, 16 out of 30 had support from manufacturers. Not all the studies reported whether important basic supports for mothers were provided such as access to food and fluid, a place to rest near their baby, and the availability of knowledgeable health workers. The available evidence indicates that effective measures include starting to express milk soon after birth if the infant is unable to feed at the breast, relaxation, breast massage, warming of the breasts, hand expression, and use of low cost pumps.These may be as effective, or more effective, than large more costly electric pumps for some outcomes. The most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. Publications on breast milk pumping should not be taken to imply that use of a pump is a routine part of breastfeeding, rather, practitioners need to be able to justify the use of a pump for an individual mother prior to making a recommendation on its use.
The evidence we present is current to May 2014. We found four studies that evaluated the restriction or banning of alcohol advertising via any format. One was a small randomised controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated drinking behaviour in 80 young men in the Netherlands exposed to movies with either a high or low alcohol content combined with a commercial with either a neutral content (interpreted as a ban on alcohol advertising) or a high alcohol content. The other three studies were interrupted time series (ITS) studies. ITS studies are studies in which changes, usually in the general public, are measured at various points before, during and after an intervention such as a change in policy. Two of the three ITS studies evaluated what happened after an advertising ban was introduced by two different Canadian provincial governments. The third ITS study evaluated what happened after a ban was lifted after being in place for 50 years in another Canadian province. Each study evaluated a different category of ban (either partial or full).
None of the above studies were funded by the alcohol or advertising industries. The data arising from the included studies did not show a clear effect either for or against the banning or restriction of alcohol advertising.
In the RCT, young men who watched movies with a low-alcohol content drank less than men who watched movies with a high-alcohol content. Young men exposed to commercials with a neutral content compared with those exposed to commercials for alcohol drank less. The trial was one and a half hours, so we do not know how long beyond the trial these effects lasted. The trial did not report on any harmful outcomes.
The results from the three ITS studies were inconsistent. We statistically combined the results of the two studies that assessed what happened after a ban was introduced. This showed an overall increase in beer consumption in the general population following the introduction of the ban, but the results were uncertain and could also be consistent with no difference or an overall decrease in alcohol consumption. The third ITS study, which evaluated the lifting of a total ban on all forms of alcohol advertising to a ban on spirits advertising only, also found uncertain results. None of the studies reported on any harms arising from the bans. Overall we judged the quality of evidence to be very low in the RCT. This was based on the fact that there were problems with the study methodology, the population included men only and the results were not very accurate. In the ITS studies, the quality was also judged to be very low due to problems with the study methodology and the results not being precise. The review cannot recommend for or against banning alcohol advertising. Governments that are considering implementing alcohol advertising bans would be advised to implement the ban in a research environment and monitor the effects over time to build the evidence base.
This review includes 136 trials of NRT, with 64,640 people in the main analysis. All studies were conducted in people who wanted to quit smoking. Most studies were conducted in adults and had similar numbers of men and women. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. The evidence is current to July 2017. Trials lasted for at least six months. We found evidence that all forms of NRT made it more likely that a person's attempt to quit smoking would succeed. The chances of stopping smoking were increased by 50% to 60%. NRT works with or without additional counselling, and does not need to be prescribed by a doctor. Side effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks. The overall quality of the evidence is high, meaning that further research is very unlikely to change our conclusions.
The review aims to determine what length of stay in hospital is the most helpful and is now based on a 2012 search. Six randomised trials are included that compare short stay in hospital with either long stay in hospital or standard care. No differences were found between groups in readmission to hospital, mental state, leaving the study early, risk of death and people lost to follow-up. There was a significant difference favouring short-stay hospitalisation for social functioning. There was limited information that suggested that short-stay hospitalisation does not encourage a ‘revolving door’ pattern of admission to hospital and disjointed or poor care.
This should reassure people with mental illness coming into hospital that a short stay (of less than 28 days) means they are no more likely to be readmitted, to leave hospital abruptly, or to lose contact with services after leaving hospital than if they received long-stay care. Short-stay patients are also more likely to leave hospital on their planned discharge date and possibly have a greater chance of finding employment. For psychiatrists, policy makers and health professionals it is important to know that short-stay hospitalisation does not lead to a ‘revolving door’ pattern of admission to hospital and poor or fragmented care.
However, all evidence in this review was rated by the review authors to be low quality. More large, well-designed and well-reported trials are justified that focus on important outcomes such as death, self-harm, harm to others, employment, criminal behaviour, mental state, satisfaction with treatment and services, homelessness, social or family relationships and costs.

An update search was carried out in 2012 and the review now includes 55 studies that assess the effects of chlorpromazine in treating schizophrenia compared with no active treatment (‘dummy’ treatment or placebo). Evidence was, in the main, rated by the review authors as low quality. There is some evidence to suggest that chlorpromazine reduces relapse and improves people’s mental health, symptoms and functioning. However, the side effects of chlorpromazine are severe and debilitating. Chlorpromazine causes sleepiness and sedation. It also causes movement disorders (such as tremors and uncontrollable shaking), considerable weight gain and lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness.
Chlorpromazine is low-cost and widely available. Despite its many side effects, chlorpromazine is likely to remain a benchmark drug and one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide.
It should be noted that the quality of evidence from the 55 included studies was low and in addition to this, 315 studies were excluded because of flaws in the reporting of information or data and in research design and methods. Larger, better conducted and reported trials should focus on important outcomes such as quality of life, levels of satisfaction, relapse, hospital discharge or admission and number of violent incidents.
We included randomized controlled trials, both published and unpublished. We did not apply any limitation by language, country, or study design. We included people (adults or children) with acute ischemic stroke irrespective of the underlying cause. Stroke was based on the clinical diagnosis confirmed with brain scans. We included trials that compared citicoline with placebo, usual care, or other usual treatment. We identified 10 relevant trials that included 4281 participants; six trials were carried out in multiple centers and two were international. We considered most trials to be at high risk of bias and they included small numbers of participants. This raises the risk of over-estimating benefits and under-estimating harms. Trials tested citicoline given either by mouth or by injection. Citicoline did not seem to influence death or disability in daily activities, severe side-effects, functional recovery, or neurological recovery. Risks of bias, imprecision, and outcome reporting bias all make the quality of evidence low. None of the included trials reported data on quality of life. Researchers poorly reported harms caused by citicoline, so the profile of harms remains unclear.
In this review we analysed the effectiveness of functional analysis-based interventions for challenging behaviour in dementia. We found eighteen randomised controlled trials suitable for analysis in all four types of care settings. The majority were in family care settings and there were surprisingly few care home based studies. Most evaluated broad programmes of care, where FA was just one component of a wide range of other interventions. This made it hard to determine the real effect of FA for the management of challenging behaviour in dementia.
However, positive results were noted in the frequency of the person’s reported problem behaviours and the caregiver’s reaction to them. No significant effects were found for incidence or severity of mood and other problem behaviours. Similarly, no significant effects were found for caregiver mood or burden.
Whilst it is too early to reach a firm conclusion on the evidence for FA in the management of challenging behaviour in dementia, we note emerging beneficial effects on challenging behaviour where multi-component psychosocial interventions have used FA as part of the programme of care.
In the studies we included in our review, the control participants (those who did not receive medication) received no treatment in six studies, received a dummy pill (placebo) in one study, and wore compression stockings in one study.
We combined information from five studies, and this showed that LMWH – a medicine that people inject into their abdominal area every day – does not clearly reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism or symptomatic deep vein thrombosis compared with no treatment. LMWH may reduce the risk of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (a clot in the leg without symptoms, usually detected by testing), but we are very uncertain about the results. LMWH had no clear effect on bleeding.
In one study, oral rivaroxaban did not reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis, and also did not increase minor bleeding when compared to placebo. The study reported no cases of pulmonary embolism or major bleeding.
In one study that compared aspirin with no treatment, no participants had pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis or bleeding.
Compared to compression stockings, LMWH did not reduce pulmonary embolism or bleeding, but did reduce symptomatic deep vein thrombosis. Our confidence in the evidence differs across treatments and results of treatment. We are not very confident about the evidence for pulmonary embolism and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis because the total number of cases (clots) was small. We are not confident in the evidence on asymptomatic clots because participants were aware of the treatments they had, and may have revealed this information – whether accidentally or on purpose – to the medical staff who were looking for the clots. In addition, asymptomatic clots may be less clinically important in people who are at low risk of clots or who quickly regain mobility after the knee arthroscopy. This Cochrane Review updates our previous evidence. The evidence is current to 1 June 2021.
The search for suitable studies was completed on 12 January 2017. We have analysed a total of 48 randomised controlled trials (4451 women) in this review. The current review update includes five additional studies, which all investigated metformin in women with PCOS. The studies compared insulin-sensitising drugs with placebo, no treatment, or the ovulation-induction agent, clomiphene citrate. Our updated review showed that metformin may be beneficial in improving the chances of having a live birth compared with either no treatment or placebo. It is not clear from the available evidence whether metformin or clomiphene citrate is superior for live birth rate, although pregnancy and ovulation rates are improved with clomiphene citrate, and women taking clomiphene citrate have fewer side effects. However, it is possible that a woman's body mass index may affect which treatment she should take for the greatest benefit, although further research is required to establish this. Metformin did not appear to increase the risk of miscarriage.
The limited improvement in metabolic outcomes with metformin treatment highlights the importance of weight loss and lifestyle adjustment, particularly in overweight women with PCOS. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Main limitations were risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of study methodology and incomplete outcome data), imprecision and inconsistency.
This review, which updates the 2013 version, aimed to find out the effects of orthodontic treatment for underbite in children and adolescents. We searched for studies that compared one type of brace for underbite to another type or no treatment. We summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 29 studies, involving 1169 children aged 5 to 13 years when treatment started. Most studies lasted between 5 and 18 months, and assessed outcomes at the end of treatment. Only one study assessed outcomes after the end of treatment. The studies used a wide variety of braces, including the following types. rests on the forehead and chin and is connected to the upper teeth by an expansion appliance – which widens the upper jaw to create more space or correct bite problems – with elastic bands placed by the wearer. The force causes the top teeth and jaw to move forward and downward. rests on the chin with a strap around the back of the head to reduce forward growth of the lower jaw. expansion appliance is placed on the top teeth. Elastic bands, placed by the wearer, run from it to a clear, removable gumshield brace on the lower teeth. The force pulls the top teeth forwards and downwards and the bottom teeth back. top and bottom removable braces with an expansion screw in the top brace, blocks of plastic over the side teeth, angled to hold the bottom jaw back, and plastic pads to hold the top lip away from the teeth. attachments are fixed to top and bottom teeth. The top attachment has a hook on each side. A metal bar is placed in the lower attachment, which sits in front of the lower teeth. An elastic band is placed on each side to pull the top jaw forwards and bottom jaw backwards. metal plates, fixed to the bone with miniscrews, are placed under the gums during an operation. They have a visible hook from which elastic bands are placed by the wearer between the top and bottom jaws or to a facemask. Combining studies, we found that non-surgical orthodontic treatments and surgical orthodontic treatment with miniplates can substantially improve the bite and the jaw relationship, immediately after treatment.
Only one study, which assessed facemask, looked at long-term effects of braces. Improvements in the bite and jaw position were seen after three years, but appeared to have been lost by six years. Nevertheless, orthodontists judged that children who had received facemask treatment were less likely to need jaw surgery in adulthood than those who did not have this treatment. More long-term studies are needed to find out how long orthodontic treatment benefits last.
We combined results from studies that compared facemask treatment to other treatments. This did not show the other interventions to be superior to the facemask, but there was a lot of variation in the data, so we cannot draw reliable conclusions.
There may be no advantage to securing facemasks with surgical miniplates, but the evidence is uncertain and further research is needed.
Using a facemask without an expansion appliance may work as well as with an expansion appliance. Alternating between expansion and constriction may be no different than expansion alone. However, the evidence for facemask variations is uncertain. More research is needed to determine the optimal facemask therapy. The studies were small and everyone involved knew what orthodontic treatment the children were receiving. Our confidence in the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. We know that non-surgical and surgical orthodontic treatments in childhood can treat underbite effectively, but how long this benefit lasts is uncertain. Whether one orthodontic treatment is more effective than another is also uncertain. The evidence is current to January 2023.
We included one randomised controlled clinical trial with moderate risk of bias that tested a combination of oxycodone and naloxone against placebo capsules, taken twice daily in participants whodid not respond to more usual medications. Researchers used the International RLS severity scale to find out if patients were improved after 12 weeks of treatment. Particpants receiving the combined oxycodone and naloxone reported improvement in RLS symptoms, Quality of life, and sleep quality; 42% of the drug group were symptom-free.
Discussion
The study was well designed overall, but was at a high risk of bias due to the high percentage of participants who withdrew from treatment (attrition bias). Eighty-four percent of the drug group developed adverse events, which were mostly related to the gastrointestinal system, headache, fatigue, and sleepiness (somnolence); 9.8% left the study because of the adverse events.
Conclusion
The use of opioids for the treatment of RLS in patients resistant to conventional treatment is supported by low-quality evidence. Prescription of these medications should be based on clinical experience, and caution used due to the potential for abuse, dependency, and adverse events. No patient on opioids complained that their symptoms worsened.
We reviewed all eligible clinical trials comparing TENS to 'fake' TENS (known as 'sham'), usual care or no treatment, or comparing TENS plus usual care versus usual care alone, for neuropathic pain in adults. As of September 2016, we found 15 studies eligible for inclusion. Of these 15 studies, we were able to combine results from five studies to investigate the effect of TENS compared to sham TENS for treatment of pain. The studies involved a range of neuropathic pain problems (e.g. people with spinal cord injury, back pain with nerve involvement, complications associated with diabetes, etc.). We found the quality of the studies overall to be low. We were unable to confidently state whether TENS is effective in relieving pain compared to sham TENS in people with neuropathic pain. This is due to the very low quality of the evidence, which means we have very limited confidence in this result and that future studies are likely to change this result. Lack of reported data meant we were unable to draw any conclusion on the effect of TENS treatment on health related quality of life, pain relieving medicine use or people's impression of how TENS changed their condition.
We described the results of 10 further studies comparing TENS against other types of treatment. These 10 studies were quite varied and so we could not combine them and analyse them together. This, together with the very low quality of these 10 studies, meant we were unable to judge pain relief, health related quality of life, pain medication use or impression of change.
In three of the 15 studies, some people using TENS experienced skin irritation under the electrode pads. Three studies reported no problems and the remaining studies did not provide any details on side effects. Based on this, it is not realistic to comment on side effects associated with TENS use.
This review found very few relevant trials and data. The majority of results showed no effect and those that did were too weak to draw firm conclusions from. Results from unpublished trials are awaited before recommendations for more research can be made.
This review looks at how accurate First Rank Symptoms (FRS) are at diagnosing schizophrenia. FRS are symptoms that people with psychosis may experience, for example hallucinations, hearing voices and thinking that other people can hear their thoughts. We found 21 studies, with 6253 participants, that looked at how good FRS are at diagnosing schizophrenia when compared to a diagnosis made by a psychiatrist. These studies showed that for people who actually have schizophrenia, FRS would only correctly diagnose just over half of them as schizophrenic. For people who do not have schizophrenia, almost 20% would be incorrectly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Therefore, if a person is experiencing a FRS, schizophrenia is a possible diagnosis, but there is also a chance that it is another mental health disorder. We do not recommend that FRS alone can be used to diagnose schizophrenia. However, FRS could be useful to triage patients who need to be assessed by a psychiatrist.
We wanted to find out what are the benefits and harms of corticosteroid treatment on the risks of major complications (death; injury to the heart and lungs) following heart surgery. We searched major databases of medical literature for reports of studies that had randomly assigned adults undergoing heart surgery to receive either corticosteroids or no treatment or placebo (dummy pill). We then analysed their combined results. We found a total of 72 studies that involved 17,282 people over approximately 50 years. The people included in these studies had an average age of about 60 years. The most frequent surgery performed in the studies was coronary artery bypass graft, a common operation to restore blood flow to the heart muscle.
When we pooled the studies together, we showed that, compared with no treatment or placebo, corticosteroids had little or no effect on the risk of in-hospital death, increased the risk of heart complications, and reduced the risk of lung complications.
If corticosteroids were given to 1000 people undergoing heart surgery:
- between 25 and 36 people would die after the surgery, compared to 33 not given these medicines;
- between 68 and 86 people would suffer a heart attack, compared to 66 not given corticosteroids; and
- between 61 and 77 people would have problems in their lungs, compared to 78 not given corticosteroids.
We also showed that corticosteroids reduced the risk of heart rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation) and infections, but increased the risk of having a second operation for bleeding. Most of the studies had important flaws that make us question the certainty of their pooled results. For example, they defined events, such as having a heart attack, in different ways; they did not adopt adequate measures to ensure that the patients and investigators did not know certain information that might influence their participation in the study; some studies were very small.
The studies involved different types of people, and much has changed in the practice of heart surgery over the decades. Also, the studies used different ways of delivering corticosteroids. These factors might make it more difficult to understand if the results from these studies are the same as would be obtained in the general population.
Also, the results from the two largest studies that we included may influence the overall findings of our review. This review updates our previous review from 2011. The evidence is current to October 2022.
We included seven studies that involved a total of 333 people; two were conducted in Europe and five in the USA. Three studies took place in hospitals, one each in a student health centre and a children's clinic, but the setting was unclear in two studies. Three different antiviral drugs were studied: acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir, as well as dosage, comparison treatment (fake or no treatment), and how long people were treated and followed up. One study did not report study funding, but the other six studies appeared to have some industry support. None declared conflicts of interest, but one included two authors from a drug company. We wanted to investigate several outcomes: time to recovery; medication side effects; duration of: fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, enlarged spleen and liver; development of glandular fever complications; how long it took to eliminate the virus from the throat; health-related quality of life; days off school or work; and economic outcomes.
We found improvements in participants who received antiviral for two outcomes.
There was an improvement of five days in time taken to recover among people who received antiviral treatment, but this result was not very precise, and the way it was measured was not clearly defined. Other studies show that glandular fever symptoms can take a month or more to get better, and tiredness may occur in about one in every 10 of patients six months later. This improvement may be of limited clinical significance.
Most studies that examined adverse effects did not find any differences between people who received antivirals and those who did not.
Time taken to resolve lymph node swelling improved to nine days when antivirals were used. However, studies that reported on this, measured lymph node swelling in different ways so we cannot be sure about the accuracy of the result. Evidence quality was rated as very low for all results, which means that we cannot know the exact effect of using antivirals for glandular fever. Better studies are needed so we can draw firm conclusions.
This review (four studies involving a total of 511 participants) identified no research evidence to suggest that any type of hydrocolloid wound dressing is more effective in healing diabetic foot ulcers than other types of dressing.
In our search of the medical literature we found two randomised controlled trials, involving 26,408 women. The quality of the included trials was high, and the quality of the evidence they provided was moderate to high.
(1) Universal screening for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy, and hypothyroidism specifically, increased the number of women diagnosed with hypothyroidism, who were subsequently treated (one trial involving 4562 women; and one trial involving 21,839 women). The study of 4562 women also showed that there may have been an increase in the number of women diagnosed with hyperthyroidism with universal screening.
(2) Universal screening and subsequent treatment did not show clear benefits or harms for the women or their babies as it did not change the number of women with pre-eclampsia (in the one trial involving 4516 of 4562 women for this outcome), the number of women who gave birth preterm (one trial involving 4516 women), or the number of children with a disability (an intelligence quotient (IQ) less than 85 at three years of age) (one trial involving 794 children whose mothers had hypothyroidism from the total of 21,839 women).
(3) One of the included trials did not report on later disabilities for the baby, and the other trial did not report on pre-eclampsia or preterm birth. Neither of the trials reported on use of health services or costs. Although the overall quality of the evidence was moderate to high, apart from finding that universal screening can help to diagnose more women with hypothyroidism (who may then be treated), there were no clear differences in outcomes for the mothers and their babies between universal screening and case finding (or not screening at all). Even though the two included studies involved a large number of women, further evidence is needed to assess the potential short- and long-term benefits or harms of different screening methods, along with the impact on health services including costs.
We found three randomised controlled trials that compared EK with PKP, one of which used the FLEK method. The evidence was current to January 2014. The three trials enrolled a total of 139 eyes of 136 participants, of which 123 eyes were included in the final analyses. The trial on FLEK and PKP was conducted from 2005 to 2007 in the Netherlands; the other two trials were conducted in the United States and were reported in 2008 and 2009 but the study dates were not specified. Over 70% of the included participants were diagnosed with FED, and the remaining participants had other ocular conditions. There was no difference in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between the two groups in one study at 12 months and another at 24 months. Chances of having an irregular shape of the front of the cornea (astigmatism) was less but endothelial cell loss was higher following EK procedures than after PKP. Only one trial reported harms of the interventions, and indicated that FLEK may result in slightly more complications than PKP (for example, 8% graft failure in the FLEK group versus none in the PKP group; and 3% graft rejection in the FLEK group versus 2% in the PKP group). No trials reported information about quality of life or economic data. The quality of the evidence was not high due to some limitations with the study designs and because all trials had small numbers of participants with FED.
Futures studies should aim to provide reliable information about which method is more effective in maintaining oral health of removable denture wearers. The scarce data found was restricted to the cleansing of complete dentures made from an acrylic resin base. Further research should also investigate how removable partial dentures can be cleaned, and in particular on the corrosive effects of cleaners on their metallic components.
Authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 14 August 2014. It includes 10 studies published from 1991 to 2014 in which 7969 participants were randomised (5903 of whom were included in the analyses) to receive xylitol products or a placebo (a substitute without xylitol) or no treatment, and the amount of tooth decay was compared. One study included adults, the others included children aged from 1 month to 13 years. The products tested were the kind that are held in the mouth and sucked (lozenges, sucking tablets and sweets) or slowly released through a dummy/pacifier, as well as toothpastes, syrups, and wipes. There is some evidence to suggest that using a fluoride toothpaste containing xylitol may reduce tooth decay in the permanent teeth of children by 13% over a 3 year period when compared to a fluoride-only toothpaste. Over this period, there were no side effects reported by the children. The remaining evidence we found did not allow us to conclude whether or not any other xylitol-containing products can prevent tooth decay in infants, older children, or adults. The evidence presented is of low to very low quality due to the small amount of available studies, uncertain results, and issues with the way in which they were conducted.
This review of randomized controlled studies looked at the different timing options for administration of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infectious complications in women undergoing cesarean delivery. We compared preoperative administration to administration after the cord had been clamped.
The review includes 10 studies (with data from 5041 women). The studies were at a low risk of bias. Antibiotics given to women before cesarean delivery nearly halved the risks of combined infections (43%), endometritis (46%), and wound infection (41%) compared to giving the antibiotics after clamping of the baby’s umbilical. Other maternal infections such as urinary or lung infections were no different between the two groups of women, nor were adverse effects in newborns. High quality evidence shows that preoperative intravenous antibiotic administration decreases postpartum infections and is, therefore, beneficial for the mother. Maternal side effects were not consistently reported. Numbers were limited with respect to information on newborns and any adverse outcomes. Further research may be needed to determine adverse effects on the babies.
We included 23 controlled trials with 1054 participants. Nine studies (312 participants) assessed the effectiveness of KT versus sham therapy (i.e. fake kinesio taping) and fourteen studies (742 participants) assessed the effectiveness of KT versus other conservative treatments (e.g.,conventional taping, physical therapies, exercise, glucocorticoid injection, oral medication). Most participants were aged between 18 and 50 years. Females comprised 52% of the sample.  Overall pain (lower scores mean less pain):

no studies reported the outcome.
Quality of life (12-item Short Form Survey-, higher scores mean better quality):
improved by 18.7% (14.48% better to 22.92% better) or 18.7 points
• People who had conservative treatment rated quality of life as 37.94 points.
• People who had kinesio taping rated quality of life as 56.64 points.
Adverse events:
No reliable estimates for adverse events (7 studies) could be provided due to heterogeneous description of events. Based on overall very low-quality evidence, KT for rotator cuff disease has uncertain effects on pain, function, pain on motion and active range of motion when compared to sham taping or other conservative treatment. Low-certainty evidence shows that kinesio taping may improve quality of life when compared to conservative treatment. Evidence on adverse events was scarce and uncertain due to low event rates, thus, we could not obtain a reliable estimate
In this review of the literature, up to August 2017, we identified seven randomised trials involving 696 women that compared the use of progestogens in the treatment of threatened miscarriage with either placebo or no treatment. We found that the use of a progestogen probably reduces the rate of spontaneous miscarriage and this was supported by moderate-quality evidence. Five trials, involving 588 women, reported on the effectiveness of progestogens given for threatened miscarriage in reducing the rate of preterm delivery and showed little or no effect, with low-quality evidence. Two trials, involving 337 women, reported on the effect of treatment with progestogens given for threatened miscarriage on the rate of occurrence of congenital abnormalities in the newborns. The evidence on congenital abnormalities is uncertain, because the quality of the evidence for this outcome was based on only two small trials with very few events and was found to be of very low quality. The evidence suggests that progesterone probably reduces the rate of spontaneous miscarriage but may make little or no difference to the number of preterm deliveries. The evidence for congenital abnormalities is uncertain because the quality of the evidence for this outcome was based on only two small trials with very few events and was found to be of very low quality.
The review of eight studies (1418 women) suggests that offering specific treatment for gestational diabetes may be associated with better baby and mother outcomes, but has not found robust evidence on the best choice of treatment which provides the better outcomes for these women and their babies, even if identified correctly. More research is needed to assess long-term mother and baby outcomes.
In February 2012, we did computer searches for randomized trials that examined family planning methods based on fertility awareness. For the original review, we also looked at studies mentioned in these trials as well as in review articles. We included trials that compared a fertility awareness-based method with a placebo ('dummy') or with another method including a different fertility awareness method. The test method could also be compared to a fertility awareness-based method used with another type of birth control.
Three studies were found; one was from Colombia and two were from Los Angeles, California. Due to weak methods, we could not analyze any data. Pregnancy rates could not be determined. The Colombia trial found similar numbers of women became pregnant in the ovulation and symptothermal groups. The Los Angeles trial observed more pregnancies in the group with the ovulation method. The USA trials found it hard to recruit couples, while the Colombia report did not mentioned that issue. Drop-out rates were high. In the two larger trials, most participants stopped their method early.
We still do not know how well these methods work for family planning. Even with a lot of training and support, most people in these trials stopped early. Birth control methods should be tested carefully before they are widely shared and used. Randomized trials are the best test of whether something works or not.
One randomised controlled trial (current until August 2016), studying 100 male participants and comparing hand-assisted laparoscopic repair with EVAR, was included in this review. No in-hospital deaths occurred during the study. The trial showed that hand-assisted laparoscopic repair took longer to perform than EVAR but there was no difference in the number of patients with reduced blood flow to the leg following either treatment. At present, there is a lack of randomised controlled trials examining the comparative effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic repair of AAA. The quality of the available evidence was imprecise due to the inclusion of one small study and wide confidence intervals; and indirect because the study includes male participants only. Further research is required before conclusions can be made.
We looked for all studies that compared Aquablation to transurethral resection of the prostate. We included both studies in chance decided how men were treated and studies in which men and their urologist decided. We searched for studies up to 11 February 2019. We found only one study in which chance decided how men were treated. The study compared Aquablation to transurethral resection of the prostate. On average, men were about 66 years old. We did not find any other studies.
We found that Aquablation likely improves urinary symptoms similarly to transurethral resection of the prostate and may also lead to similar quality of life. Rates of unwanted serious effects may also be similar but we are very uncertain about this.
Men who have Aquablation may have a similar risk of needing a repeat procedure as those having transurethral resection of the prostate but we are very uncertain of this finding.
Aquablation may make little to no difference to erectile function but may have fewer issues with ejaculation, but we are very uncertain of both findings.
These findings are based on a single study funded by the company that makes the device used for Aquablation. All data were limited to 12 months' follow-up or less and prostate size was less than or equal to 80 mL. Our certainty about the evidence we found ranged from moderate to very low due to shortcomings in how the study was done and small study size. This means that we have either moderate, limited or very little confidence in the results, depending on the outcome.
We found 80 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which included a total of 5820 women and compared 20 different types of NSAIDs with placebo (an inactive pill), paracetamol or each other. Most of the studies were commercially funded (59%), and a further 31% did not state their source of funding. The review found that NSAIDs appear to be very effective in relieving period pain. The evidence suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so. NSAIDs appear to work better than paracetamol, but it is unclear whether any one NSAID is safer or more effective than others.
NSAIDs commonly cause adverse effects (side effects), including indigestion, headaches and drowsiness. The evidence suggests that if 10% of women taking placebo experience side effects, between 11% and 14% of women taking NSAIDs will do so.
Based on two studies that made head-to-head comparisons, there was no evidence that newer types of NSAID (known as COX-2-specific inhibitors) are more effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea than traditional NSAIDs (known as non-selective inhibitors), nor that there is a difference between them with regard to adverse effects. We rated the quality of the evidence as low for most comparisons, mainly due to poor reporting of study methods.
We wanted to find out if ocrelizumab is more effective than any other medicine or placebo in people with relapsing-remitting MS and primary progressive MS.
We were interested in how many people:
– had symptom flare-ups;
– had worsening symptoms;
– experienced unwanted effects; and
– stopped treatment due to unwanted effects. We searched for studies that compared ocrelizumab against any other medicine or placebo for people with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS or primary progressive MS. People in the studies could be any age or sex, could have mild or severe symptoms, and could have had MS for any length of time.
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found four studies with 2551 people with MS. The largest study included 732 people and the smallest included 163 people. The studies were in countries around the world, but mostly in the USA. One study lasted for 24 weeks; two studies for 96 weeks; and one study for at least 120 weeks. Pharmaceutical companies funded the four studies.
Three studies compared ocrelizumab with interferon beta-1a in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Interferon beta-1a is an older type of disease-modifying therapy. One study compared ocrelizumab with placebo for people with primary progressive MS. Ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta-1a for people with relapsing-remitting MS, after 96 weeks of treatment:
– probably substantially reduces the number of people who had flare-ups;
– may substantially reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse;
– probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects; and
– may substantially reduce the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects.
Ocrelizumab compared with placebo for people with primary progressive MS, after 120 weeks of treatment:
– may reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse;
– probably increases unwanted effects;  and
– may make little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects and the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects. Our confidence in the results is moderate to low for several reasons. First, people dropped out of the studies unevenly, which meant more people had one treatment than the other. Second, there was not enough information about some of our points of interest to allow us to draw conclusions for outcomes, there was not enough information available for us to be confident in the results. Finally, changes in symptoms shown by scans could have been due to causes other than disease progression. The evidence is up-to-date to 8 October 2021.
Review authors working with Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review of randomised controlled trials. The evidence is current up to August 2017.
We included 87 trials that investigated the success of pulp treatment of milk teeth. The trials were published between 1989 and 2017 and provided 125 comparisons of different treatment options. Pulp treatment for extensive decay in primary teeth is generally successful. The proportion of treatment failures was low, with many of the included trials having no failures with either of the treatments being compared.
After a pulpotomy, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) seems to be the best material (in terms of biocompatibility and efficacy) to put into contact with the remaining root dental nerve. The evidence showed it to be less likely to fail than either calcium hydroxide or formocresol.
After pulpectomy, it is not clear whether any medicament is superior to another. ZOE paste may give better results than Vitapex (calcium hydroxide/iodoform) paste, but more studies are needed to confirm this and to explore other treatment options.
Regarding direct pulp capping, the small number of studies undertaking the same comparison limits any interpretation. Formocresol may be superior to calcium hydroxide in terms of clinical and radiological failure, but because of toxic effects associated with formocresol, safer alternatives should be evaluated. We judged the quality of the evidence suggesting the superiority of MTA over calcium hydroxide or formocresol after pulpotomy to be moderate. For other comparisons, the quality of the evidence is low or very low, which means we cannot be certain about the findings. The low quality is due to shortcomings in the methods used within the individual trials, the small number of children included in the trials and the short-term follow-up after treatment.
Future trials to evaluate which healing agents are best for the three pulp treatments would require a very large sample size and should follow up the participants of a minimum of one year.
Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Velnacrine is a derivative of tacrine. There is evidence that it is toxic in a similar way to tacrine and all research stopped in 1994. The FDA peripheral and CNS drug advisory board voted unanimously against recommending approval.
We included three clinical trials containing 1103 infants from two countries. The trials included infants born at or near their due date (35 weeks of gestation or later) who were less than two weeks old. One study evaluated healthy babies, and the other two evaluated babies with jaundice. In one study, the babies received either sunlight therapy or no treatment to assess sunlight for the prevention or reduction of jaundice. In the other two studies, infants with jaundice were randomly assigned to receive treatment with phototherapy machines or to receive sunlight through a light-filtering tent that blocked ultraviolet light and infrared radiation, and these groups were compared for improvement in their jaundice. One study did not comment on funding. The other two studies were funded by the Thrasher Research Fund. Evidence is current to June 2020. Sunlight versus no treatment: babies exposed to sunlight may have a reduced occurrence of jaundice and be jaundiced for fewer days compared to babies who have no preventive treatment for jaundice. There was no reduction in readmission to hospital for jaundice in babies exposed to sunlight compared to babies who were not treated.
Sunlight versus other sources of phototherapy: when compared to babies who were exposed to electric phototherapy treatment, babies exposed to sunlight had a similar rate of decline in bilirubin levels. Using light-filtering films, babies exposed to sunlight did not have increased rates of sunburn, dehydration, or hypothermia. Babies exposed to sunlight were at an increased risk of hyperthermia. The effectiveness of sunlight might not be inferior to phototherapy, if sunlight can be delivered for at least four hours per day, and electric phototherapy can be delivered at night when needed.
 The certainty of the evidence for outcomes in all three studies was very low to moderate. It was very low for all the main outcomes in each study. We are uncertain whether sunlight is effective for the prevention or treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term or late preterm neonates.
This review looked at the effects of target payments on the behaviour of primary care physicians (e.g. general practitioners and family physicians). Under a target payments system a lump sum is paid to physicians who provide a certain quantity or level of care. Two studies assessed the impact of target payments on immunisation rates. There was some evidence that target payments resulted in an increase in immunisations by primary care physicians. However there was insufficient evidence to provide a clear answer as to whether target payments were an effective method of improving quality of care.
The review found 16 trials which involved 1643 children. Most simple behavioural treatments were only studied in single small trials which makes the evidence less reliable. Simple treatments such as rewarding dry nights (e.g. with star charts), lifting and waking and bladder training appeared to be more effective than no treatment but they are not as effective when compared with other treatments known to work, such as enuresis alarm therapy and drug therapy. There does not appear to be one simple behavioural therapy that is more effective than another. On the other hand, simple treatments do not have any side effects or safety concerns. Therefore, simple methods could be tried as first line therapy before considering alarms or drugs for this common childhood condition.
This review includes 10 randomised controlled trials. Eight had treatment arms that compared the regular use of clotting factor concentrates to prevent joint bleeds with different dosing schemes to identify regimens that may be better; four had treatment arms that compared the regular use of factor concentrates to prevent bleeds to their 'on demand' use to treat bleeds once they occur (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). In people living with hemophilia A or B previously treated for joint bleeding or with existing joint damage, preventive therapy may reduce the number of joint bleeds compared to 'on-demand therapy'. This reduction in bleeds may lead to an improvement in joint function, pain, and quality of life. However, preventive therapy is linked to an increased use of factor concentrates and therefore higher treatment costs. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventive course of treatment in terms of starting time, frequency and dose level. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have affected the results. Future research might have an important role in changing our confidence in these results.
We searched for studies up to August 2019. We included 10 studies with a total of 993 patients comparing fibrinolytics with a placebo and compared these to look for differences. We also included two studies comparing different fibrinolytics with a total of 149 patients and compared these separately. We found some low-certainty evidence that fibrinolytics moderately reduced the need for surgery. There was no clear evidence that fibrinolytics changed the risk of death. There was some low-certainty evidence which showed that there may be a risk of more side effects (mostly bleeding) with fibrinolytics but this is uncertain. We found no clear evidence that any single fibrinolytic was better than another. We considered the certainty of the evidence identified comparing fibrinolytic with placebo to vary from moderate (risk of death) to very low (overall treatment failure). This was mostly due to some studies having one or more domains at high risk of bias as well as concerns that not all studies of this treatment appear to have been published. We considered the evidence comparing individual fibrinolytics to be of low certainty due to not enough patients in the studies as well as one study being at a high risk of bias.
The review authors identified only one randomised controlled trial, from Japan, reported in 1991. A total of 102 children were randomised to receive IVIG with or without salicylate. There was no clear benefit of adding salicylate to immunoglobulin treatment on the rate of coronary artery abnormalities observed, up to 30 days. The spread of findings was wide and could include a beneficial effect of salicylate. There are theoretical grounds for using salicylate to prevent damage to the coronary arteries. However, there are concerns that aspirin use in children to treat fever can have adverse effects and children with Kawasaki disease who are treated with immunoglobulins have a very low rate of coronary artery abnormalities.
This review includes 17 randomised controlled trials, involving 9030 women. The quality of the included trials is low to moderate. We, examined several aspects of dietary advice and supplementation and produced the following four main findings.
(1) Providing nutritional advice resulted in an increase in the mother's protein intake, there were fewer babies born too early (two trials involving 449 women) and fewer babies with low birthweight (one trial involving 300 women), One study of 389 women showed increases in some babies birth head circumference (in one trial involving 389 women) There were also more babies with a higher birthweight among undernourished women (two trials involving 320 women).
(2) Giving the mothers balanced energy and protein supplements was associated with fewer babies dying during labour (five trials, 3408 women), clear increases in birthweight (11 trials, 5385 women) and fewer babies who were small-for-gestational age (seven trials, 4408 women). However, the impact on the long-term health of the baby was uncertain, including among undernourished women.
(3) High-protein supplementation (one trial involving 1051 women) showed no benefit for women and potential harm for the baby through an increase in the number of babies small for their gestational age at birth.
(4) Isocaloric protein supplementations (i.e. balanced supplements in which the protein replaces an equal quantity of other nutrients, e.g. fat and carbohydrate): in birthweight and weekly gestational weight gain, showed no benefit for women or their babies (two trials involving 184 women). Providing nutritional advice or balanced energy and protein supplements to women during pregnancy may be beneficial. However, there is not enough evidence on isocaloric protein supplements which currently appear to be unhelpful and high-protein supplements may be harmful.
The available evidence does not fully establish CSF drainage as a method of protection. The review authors made a thorough search of the medical literature and identified three randomised trials involving a total of 287 participants operated on for high-risk thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. All of the studies used CSF drainage in addition to other measures of spinal cord protection. In the first trial of 98 patients, neurological deficits in the lower extremities occurred in about one third of patients with or without drainage. The deficit was observed within 24 hours of the operation in 21 (68%), and from three to 22 days in 10 (32%). The second trial of 33 patients reported that a combination of CSF drainage and papaverine in the region of the spinal cord (intrathecally) reduced the rate of postoperative neurological deficit compared to controls. In the third trial involving 145 patients, drainage was begun during the operation and continued for 48 hours after surgery. Paraplegia or paraparesis occurred less with CSF drainage (2.7% of patients with drainage versus 12.2% in the control group).
The main objective of this review is to investigate the effectiveness of social skills programmes, compared to standard care or discussion groups, for people with schizophrenia. Based on searches carried out in 2006 and 2011, this review includes 13 trials with a total of 975 participants. Authors chose seven main outcomes of interest, all data for these outcomes were rated to be very low quality. The review found significant differences in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. Rates of relapse were lower for social skills compared to standard care and there was a significant difference in favour of social skills on people’s mental state. Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care. However, when social skills programmes were compared to discussion groups, there were no significant differences in people’s social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality of life.
Compared to standard care, social skills programmes may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates. However, at the moment evidence is very limited with data only of very low quality available. Cultural differences might also limit the relevance of current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China. Whether social skills programmes or training can improve the social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be further investigated in a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial.

We aimed to find out which was the better way to keep a newborn baby's intravenous line open and working -- either running a continuous amount of intravenous fluid through it (continuous infusion) or giving a small amount of fluid through it every few hours (intermittent flush) only. One study showed no difference between the two approaches for keeping a baby's intravenous line open and working and one study showed an advantage for intermittent flushes. The studies, however, had some problems in how the data were analysed and reported. Therefore, we are uncertain as to how reliable the results are and further research should be undertaken.
This is an update of a review first published in 2014, updated in 2017. We searched for evidence from randomised controlled studies in November 2018. We identified 12 studies involving 944 women (type 1 diabetes: 660 women; type 2 diabetes: 113 women; in two trials (171 women) there was a mix of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The trials were from Europe, USA and Canada.
There were six comparisons. These were: continuous versus intermittent monitoring of blood glucose (four studies, 609 women); two different ways of self-monitoring (two studies, 43 women); self-monitoring at home versus hospitalisation to control blood glucose levels (one study, 100 women); blood glucose monitoring before a meal (pre-prandial) versus blood glucose monitoring after a meal (post-prandial) (one study, 61 women); automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional care (three studies, 84 women); and constant continuous monitoring versus intermittent continuous monitoring (one study, 25 women),
Continuous versus intermittent monitoring may reduce overall high blood pressure problems during pregnancy (two studies, 384 women, low-quality evidence). However, it should be noted that only two of four relevant studies reported data for this outcome. There was more evidence on high blood pressure and protein in their urine (pre-eclampsia), which showed no clear difference (four studies, 609 women). We also found no difference in the number of women having a caesarean section (three studies, 427 women; moderate-quality evidence). There was not enough evidence to assess infant deaths or the combined outcome of infant deaths and ill-health as these outcomes were based on single studies. Four studies received some support from commercial partners.
The other comparisons of different ways of monitoring blood glucose levels were based on very small studies or single studies with very low-quality evidence that did not show any clear differences in outcomes. Although the evidence from randomised controlled studies suggests that continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels may be more effective in reducing high blood pressure problems during pregnancy, only two studies reported on this. There was no clear reduction for pre-eclampsia based on evidence from four studies. For other methods of glucose monitoring, the review showed that there is not enough evidence to say with any certainty which monitoring method for blood glucose is best. More research is needed to find out which other monitoring method is best at reducing the risk of complications for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes and to confirm the effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring.
Our review included three clinical trials that randomized 263 participants (most recent search - November 28, 2017). Trials included leg arteries at and above the knee and were carried out in Europe; all used DEBs that contained the chemical known as "paclitaxel." Two companies manufactured the DEBs: Eurocor and Medtronic. Most study participants were followed for six or more months; this is called "follow-up." Results showed that DEBs were not better for participants than uncoated balloon angioplasty with regard to the need for amputation. At 24 months of follow-up, DEBs were associated with fewer target lesion revascularizations, which refers to the need to perform a procedure on a stent that had already been treated with a DEB or an uncoated balloon angioplasty for in-stent restenosis. DEBs were also found to have better binary restenosis rates, which refers to the percentage of treated stents that develop new stenosis after they have been treated with a DEB or an uncoated balloon angioplasty. Finally, more people who were treated with DEBs described improvement in their leg symptoms, as measured by a change in their Rutherford category. DEBs were not found to be better for participants than uncoated balloon angioplasty with regard to patient death. The certainty of the evidence presented was very low because we identified only three studies with small numbers of participants, and because many participants in those studies were lost to follow-up. Furthermore, risk of performance and attrition bias was significant, as was risk of other biases, due to lack of accounting for the type of stent treated and the need for bailout stenting.
This review evaluated the effects of antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for preventing HIV infection following occupational exposure. No randomized controlled trials were identified. Only one case-control study provides evidence for using zidovudine monotherapy. The study found that, in the occupational setting, HIV transmission was significantly associated with deep injury, visible blood on the sharp instrument, procedures involving a needle placed in the source patient's blood vessel, and terminal illness in the source patient. After taking these into account, it was found that those who became infected with HIV had significantly lower odds of having taken zidovudine after exposure, compared to those who did not seroconvert. There is no direct evidence to support the use of multi-drug antiretroviral regimens following occupational exposure to HIV. However, due to the success of combination therapies in treating HIV-infected individuals, a combination of drugs should be used for PEP. Eight reports from other studies confirmed the findings that adverse events were higher with a three-drug regimen; however, discontinuation rates were not significantly different. A four-week regimen of post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure, depending on the risk of seroconversion. Healthcare workers should be counseled about expected adverse events and given strategies for managing these events. They should also be advised that PEP is not 100% effective in preventing HIV seroconversion.
We searched scientific databases for trials that had considered the effectiveness of the surgical treatments of urinary incontinence after prostate surgery in men. The trials had to compare surgical treatment versus no treatment, non-surgical treatment, or another surgical treatment. The evidence is current to April 2014. There are five main types of surgery and, despite some of them being in use since the 1990s, we found only one trial that met the inclusion criteria. There was very low quality evidence that the implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter (a manufactured device to prevent urine leaking out) might be more effective than injectable treatment, but with more adverse effects and higher costs. There was no evidence about the other types of surgery.
The evidence was current to July 2019. We found 96 studies that were conducted between 1983 and 2016 in 8646 men with CP/CPPS, with assessment of 16 types of pharmacological interventions. These therapies were given to men in an outpatient setting. Most studies did not specify their funding sources; 21 studies reported funding from pharmaceutical companies. Alpha blockers: we are uncertain about the effects of alpha blockers on prostatitis symptoms. Alpha blockers may increase side-effects, for example dizziness and low blood pressure. Alpha blockers probably result in little to no difference in sexual problems, quality of life or anxiety and depression.
5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARI): 5-ARI probably reduce prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with more side effects than seen in men taking a placebo. There was no information on sexual problems, quality of life or anxiety and depression.
Antibiotics: antibiotics may reduce prostatitis symptoms and are probably not associated with side effects. Antibiotics probably result in little to no difference in sexual problems and quality of life. There was no information on anxiety and depression.
Anti-inflammatories: anti-inflammatories may reduce prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with side effects. There was no information on sexual problems, quality of life or anxiety and depression.
Phytotherapy: phytotherapy may reduce prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with side effects. Phytotherapy may not improve sexual problems. There was no information on quality of life and anxiety and depression.
Botulinum toxin A (BTA): the injection of this toxin into the prostate may cause a large reduction in prostatitis symptoms, but if it is applied to muscles of the pelvis, BTA may not cause this effect. These injections may not be associated with side effects. There was no information on sexual problems, quality of life or anxiety and depression.
Allopurinol: allopurinol may result in little to no difference in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with side effects. There was no information on sexual problems, quality of life or anxiety and depression.
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): TCM may reduce prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with side effects. TCM probably does not improve sexual problems and it may not improve symptoms of anxiety and depression. There was no information on quality of life. The quality of the evidence was low to very low in most cases, meaning that there is much uncertainty surrounding the results. The most frequent problems detected in the included studies were an inadequate design, a small sample size and a short follow-up time (usually 12 weeks).
This review identified eight randomised controlled trials involving 343 participants, evaluating the benefits of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The results show that, compared to a wait-list or pill placebo, BT/CBT is an effective treatment for reducing OCD symptoms and lowering the risk of having OCD after treatment. Based on three studies that directly compared BT/CBT with medication, there was no current evidence to suggest that either BT/CBT or medication was superior to the other. When combined with medication, BT/CBT produces better outcomes than medication alone. Although based on a small number of studies, these findings provide support for the value of BT/CBT in the treatment of children and adolescents with OCD.
Ibuprofen is a NSAID that can be delivered intravenously. We wanted to know if intravenous ibuprofen (delivered by injection or drip) is a helpful treatment option to manage moderate-to-severe pain when patients cannot take medicines by mouth. To make the comparison fair, patients in the studies must all have had the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive the ibuprofen or the other treatment.
We searched the medical literature (clinical studies) up to June 2021, where intravenous ibuprofen was used to treat pain after surgery in adults (aged over 18) and compared against:
- a placebo (a control treatment, such as a bag of saline administered into a vein); or
- another medicine. We found only one study which was suitable to include in our review. The study looked at the management of pain after bunionectomy. Bunionectomy is a surgery to remove a bunion at the base of the big toe. This study evaluated 201 people, mostly females. The study compared intravenous ibuprofen to:
- a placebo; or
- another medicine, acetaminophen (paracetamol).
We were most interested in learning how many people had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery.
Pain reduction
The study showed that:
- more people who received ibuprofen had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery as compared to those who received placebo; and
- there was little to no difference when ibuprofen was compared to another medicine, acetaminophen, i.e. the numbers of people with pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication)
Rescue medicine is an extra pain medication if the study medication is not treating the patient's pain well enough. The time (in minutes) to needing rescue medication was longer (delayed) with use of ibuprofen or acetaminophen than for those who received placebo.
Adverse events
There was not enough information in this study to assess side effects, but the rate at which they occurred appeared to be similar among all treatments. Very few patients dropped out because of side effects. This is usually the case in studies where patients are only in a study for a short period of time. We only had results from one relatively small study. This limited our confidence in the evidence. The evidence is up to date to June 2021.
We found a total of 84 randomised controlled trials (studies where participants were randomly divided into one of two or more treatment or control groups) that compared MI with either no intervention or with a different approach. Seventy of these trials focused on higher risk individuals or settings. We were mainly interested in trials with a follow-up period of 4 or more months, and the typical follow-up period was 12 months. We also evaluated the quality of the studies' designs and their applicability to our research, finding that these studies provided moderate to low quality evidence.
In 66 trials, the MI consisted of a single, individual session. In 12 studies, young people attended multiple individual sessions or mixtures of both individual sessions and group sessions. Six trials used group MI sessions only. The length of MI sessions varied, but in 57 studies it was one hour or less. The shortest MI intervention was 10 to 15 minutes, and the longest had five dedicated MI sessions over a 19-hour period.
Settings for the trials varied: 58 of the 84 studies took place in college (mainly university but also four vocational) settings. The remaining trials took place in healthcare locations, a youth centre, local companies, a job-related training centre, an army recruitment setting, UK drug agencies and youth prisons.
The total number of young adults was 22,872, aged on average from 15 to 24 years old. The proportion of males in the trials with both males and females ranged from 22% to 90%. The ethnicity of the young adults was typically mixed, but 52 of the 67 studies that reported ethnicity involved mostly white people. At four or more months follow-up, we found only small or borderline effects showing that MI reduced the quantity of alcohol consumed, frequency of alcohol consumption, alcohol problems and peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC). We didn't find any effects for binge drinking, average BAC, drink-driving or other alcohol-related risky behaviour. We found no relationship between the length of MI and its effectiveness. Also, there were no clear subgroup differences in effects when we examined the type of comparison group (assessment only control or alternative intervention, the setting (college/university vs other settings), or risk status (higher risk students vs all/low-risk students).
None of the studies reported harms related to MI.
Although we found some significant effects for MI, our reading of these results is that the strength of the effects was slight and therefore unlikely to confer any advantage in practice. Overall, there is only low or moderate quality evidence for the effects found in this review. Many of the studies did not adequately describe how young people were allocated to the study groups or how they concealed the group allocation to participants and personnel. Study drop-outs were also an issue in many studies. These problems with study quality could result in inflated estimates of MI effects, so we cannot rule out the possibility that any slight effects observed in this review are overstated.
The US National Institutes of Health provided funding for half (42/84) of the studies included in this review. Twenty-nine studies provided no information about funding, and only eight papers had a clear conflict of interest statement.
We found 39 studies including more than 16,000 adults and children with asthma who were taking a steroid inhaler. Most studies collected data at six months, so we can really apply the messages in this review only over six months - we cannot say whether these methods are effective in a few years time, for example. We searched multiple sources for relevant studies. This review is current as of November 2016.
Different studies tried different ways to help people take their inhaler more regularly. We grouped studies according to four ways of helping people take their inhaler: providing education about adherence (20 studies); using electronic monitoring or reminders to take the inhaler (11 studies); making the drug easier to take (e.g. once instead of twice a day, one inhaler instead of two) (four studies); and giving the inhaler during school hours (three studies).
We mainly looked for whether strategies helped people to take their inhaler as prescribed, and whether people had fewer asthma attacks and better asthma control. People who were given education were better at taking their inhaler than controls; 20% more people took their treatment (likely to be somewhere between 8% and 33% more). Those given trackers or electronic reminders were 19% better at using their inhaler than controls (14% and 25%). People who were given an easier way of taking their inhaler (e.g. fewer times a day) were only 4% better than those who carried on as usual (2% and 6%).
Unfortunately, these efforts to help people take their inhaler as prescribed generally did not lead to obvious benefit for things like asthma control and number of attacks, but in most cases, we could not tell either way. We also did not see a difference for quality of life or time people needed off school or work, but the evidence was often uncertain.
Studies investigating the possible benefit of giving children their inhaler during school hours did not actually measure how often they missed doses. It's difficult to tell whether these different strategies are worth using because studies were quite different from one other. This variation means that we cannot be sure what the real benefit is, beyond improving adherence. Sometimes we did not find enough studies to detect a difference between groups. The fact that most people knew which group they were in also reduced our confidence in the findings because this can affect things like how positively people respond to questionnaires. We had concerns about how many people dropped out of about half the studies, and we are uncertain whether studies reported everything they measured. The studies we found suggest that various strategies can help people with asthma take their inhaler better, compared with "control" (e.g. usual asthma care). However, many of these studies were quite different from one another, and we are not certain about whether people will find that their asthma is improved as a result of this approach.
We found 20 studies that assessed the accuracy of measuring the blood level of CRP to diagnose infections in newborn infants. These studies were similar enough to justify a combined analysis of their findings. The combined analysis indicated that a positive CRP test correctly identified infants with infection about six times out of 10. Measuring the blood level of CRP is not sufficiently accurate to help early diagnosis of infection in newborn infants.
This is a summary of a Cochrane review that looked at the effect of using one of these drugs, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). We gathered evidence from 12 trials involving 1319 participants. The evidence is current to July 2013. For patients who have never had eye surgery before, 5-FU injections after surgery can slightly reduce the pressure in the eye after one year and also the risk of having more surgery in the first year.
For patients having both cataract surgery and glaucoma surgery at the same time, no difference has been detected between injections and no injections.
Some people are at higher risk of having problems following trabeculectomy, for instance people that have had previous surgery on the eye. For this group, the 5-FU injections can reduce the pressure in the eye a little and also reduce the risk of having more surgery in the first year. Only one study has investigated the effect of using lower than normal doses in the injections. No benefit was found when compared to a control group who had no injections. If 5-Fluorouracil was applied to the eye during the surgery, there was less chance of having to have more surgery within the year and the pressure in the eye was also reduced slightly at one year. Complications such as damage to cells at the front of the eye or a leak from the wound seem more common when 5-FU is used. The methodological quality of the trials was not high in general. In many of the studies that contributed to the evidence about 5-FU after glaucoma surgery the researchers were aware of whether the participant had received the dummy injection or the 5-FU injection. This may have introduced bias into the results. Importantly the only study contributing information about low dose 5-FU was of low methodological quality so our conclusions on low dose 5-FU must be cautious.
The studies that contributed evidence about 5-FU during surgery was largely very good, the studies were designed and reported to a standard we would expect of modern trials. We concluded that the main benefit is for people at high risk of problems. There may be a smaller benefit for people at low risk of problems if 5-FU is given either as injections after surgery or during the operation. However, 5-FU was found to increase the risk of serious complications and so may not be worthwhile for the small benefit gained.
We searched the literature published before 6 January 2014, and after assessment, included three small studies that involved 101 participants. Our analysis found that although CRRT showed limited advantages over conventional treatment to improve some aspects of kidney function and muscle tissue loss, we found no significant benefits in reducing risk of death.
The small body of available evidence demonstrated poor methodological quality, and was insufficient to enable us to make any robust conclusions about the effectiveness of CRRT for people with rhabdomyolysis. Larger and better designed studies would be needed to investigate if CRRT is beneficial for people with rhabdomyolysis.
We did computer searches to find studies that compared any operation to any medicine used for abortion at this stage of pregnancy. We wrote to researchers and looked through book chapters and other articles to find more studies.
We found two studies. The first compared dilation and evacuation (D&E) to injecting a drug into the pregnant womb. The second compared D&E to drugs taken by mouth and by vagina.
The D&E operation was better than injecting medicines into the womb. Medicines taken by mouth and vagina worked as well and were as acceptable as a D&E, but caused more pain and side effects. More studies with modern medicines used for abortion after 3 months of pregnancy are needed.
We conducted a systematic review of key medical databases, searching for high-quality trials on the use of macrolides in the management of DPB. We retrieved only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 19 participants, which was of poor methodological quality. All primary outcomes and most secondary outcomes specified (e.g. five-year survival rate, lung function or clinical response) in our review were not reported in the included trial. The included trial found that the computerised tomography (CT) images of all participants treated with long-term, low-dose erythromycin improved from baseline, while the images of 71.4% of participants with no treatment worsened and 28.6% remained unchanged. Adverse effects were not reported. The evidence is current to July 2014 and we have identified no new trials for inclusion or exclusion.
We conclude that the use of macrolides for DPB is based on non-RCTs or retrospective studies and there is little evidence from RCTs. We are unable to make any new recommendations based on the findings of this review. However, while awaiting evidence from new, high-quality, well-designed studies, it is reasonable to use low-dose macrolides soon after diagnosis is made and to continue for at least six months, according to current guidelines. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to limitations in study design, which indicated high risk of potential bias and too small a sample size.
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We compared and summarized their results. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. We found 17 studies that involved a total of 1008 children aged from four to 18 years. Medical procedures included injections, taking blood, changing wound dressings, and physical exercise. Studies compared virtual reality against no distraction, or against non-virtual distraction. No studies compared different types of virtual reality.
During a medical procedure
We cannot tell whether virtual reality reduces self-reported pain during a medical procedure because we have too little confidence in the evidence available (three studies).
Only two studies investigated changes in pain assessed by an observer (for example, using a rating scale that ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (great pain)). These reported conflicting findings: in one study fully-immersive virtual reality was beneficial compared to non-virtual distraction, but not in the other.
Fully-immersive virtual reality may reduce pain assessed by an observer based on children's behaviour (for example, crying, or rubbing a body part in a way that indicates pain) more effectively than non-virtual distraction (two studies) or no distraction (one study).
Non-immersive virtual reality was not beneficial for pain assessed by an observer based on children's behaviour compared to no distraction (one study).
After a medical procedure
We cannot tell whether virtual reality can reduce self-reported pain after a medical procedure, as we have too little confidence in the evidence available (16 studies).
Five studies investigated changes in pain assessed by an observer. Virtual reality was beneficial compared to no distraction in two studies, and also when compared to non-virtual distraction in another two studies. However, it was no better than non-virtual distraction in one study.
Two studies investigating pain assessed by an observer based on children's behaviour reported conflicting findings: immersive virtual reality was beneficial compared to non-virtual distraction in one study, but not in the other.
We cannot tell whether there is a difference between virtual reality and no distraction for pain assessed by an observer based on children's behaviour, as we have too little confidence in the available evidence (one study).
Adverse effects
We cannot tell if virtual reality is associated with adverse effects because we have too little confidence in the evidence available (11 studies). We have little to very little confidence in the evidence we identified. It is unclear from our review whether virtual reality distraction makes a difference to pain in children. There is a need for large, well-designed studies in this area. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2019.
This review does not include any studies that assessed the tolerability and safety of the withdrawn COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib, valdecoxib, or lumiracoxib.This review identified two studies that included a total of 381 participants with IBD who were experiencing rheumatological manifestations. One study (159 participants) compared etoricoxib (60 to 120 mg/day) to placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) in people with IBD (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) who were in remission (i.e. no disease symptoms) or had active disease (i.e. had symptoms). The other study (222 participants) compared 2 weeks of treatment with celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) to placebo in people with ulcerative colitis who were in remission. The study that compared etoricoxib to placebo found no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who experienced exacerbation of IBD after 12 weeks of treatment. Although this study documented side effects experienced by the participants these side effects were not reported in the study manuscript. The study that compared celecoxib to placebo found no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who experienced exacerbation of ulcerative colitis after two weeks of treatment. The proportion of patients who experienced side effects was similar in the celecoxib and placebo groups (21% and 17%, respectively). No patients in either group died or experienced serious side effects. Eleven percent of patients in the celecoxib and placebo groups experienced GI side effects including increased stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and inflamed mucosa. No patients experienced any cardiovascular side effects (i.e. heart attack or stroke). Renal toxicity (i.e. the poisonous effect of a substance on the kidneys) or thrombotic side effects (i.e. the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel) were not reported. The results of the two included studies in this review suggest that celecoxib and etoricoxib do not exacerbate IBD symptoms. However, it should be noted that both studies assessed relatively small numbers of patients and were of short duration. Futhermore, the overall quality of the evidence from the studies was rated as low due to lack of precision of the results. No firm conclusions on the tolerability and safety of celecoxib and etoricoxib can be drawn from these studies. Further studies are needed to determine the tolerability and safety of celecoxib and etoricoxib in patients with rheumatological manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.
We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that were designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ECP for the management of chronic graft-versus-host disease in children and adolescents (less than 18 years of age) after HSCT. We did not find any RCTs that analysed the efficacy of ECP for children and adolescents with cGvHD after HSCT. Current recommendations are only based on retrospective studies (where outcomes occurred to the participants before the study began) or observational studies (where investigators did not intervene, and simply observed the course of events). Ideally, ECP should only be given to children and adolescents in the context of RCTs. ECP may be considered in people with steroid-refractory cGvHD, keeping in mind that such a treatment is not supported by high-level evidence. If children and adolescents are given ECP, doctors should collect information about beneficial and harmful effects and set up registries for people treated with ECP.
This systematic review shows that orally administered theophylline improves lung function and levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. However, there is limited data on its effect on symptoms, exercise capacity or quality of life. Despite being associated with increased side effects, particularly nausea, participants preferred theophylline over placebo.
We could identify only one randomised controlled trial involving 152 participants with benign thyroid nodules. The intervention group (98 participants) was treated with a combination of two Chinese herbal medicines, and no treatment was given to the control group (54 participants). The duration of treatment was three months, and overall follow-up six months. The included study did not investigate nodule volume reduction ≥ 50%; pressure symptoms, cosmetic complaints or both; health-related quality of life; all-cause mortality; cancer occurrence; changes in number and size of thyroid nodules; changes in thyroid volume; or socioeconomic effects. Thyroid hormone levels were normal in both groups before and after the study was conducted. No adverse events were reported. The overall quality of the included study was unclear or low. This evidence is up to date as of April 2013.
a total of 11 studies were identified with 1296 women; most studies were conducted in the USA. Four studies evaluated the use of antibiotics before the birth (antepartum); six studies evaluated the use of antibiotics after birth (postpartum); and one compared antibiotic administration both before and after birth. the quality of the evidence was ranked low to very low, mainly because many studies had methodological limitations with outcome results based on limited numbers of trials and included participants that could be pooled. based on the findings of one study, treatment during labor was found to be more effective than treatment after labor; however this finding relates only to maternal and neonatal length of hospital stay and to neonatal severe infection. No evidence indicated that a higher dose of antibiotics before birth was superior to a lower dose. Immediately following birth, no evidence showed that different types of antibiotics or longer or shorter treatment duration improved the health of the mother and her newborn. All women who participated in the postpartum trials received antibiotics before the time of birth. Therefore insufficient information was available from randomized controlled trials to reveal the most appropriate regimen of antibiotics for the treatment of patients with intra-amniotic infection, whether antibiotics should be continued during the postpartum period, and which antibiotic regimen should be used and for what duration. None of the included studies reported information related to adverse effects of the intervention.
We identified 16 studies (2953 participants) examining the outcomes of urgent versus conventional start peritoneal dialysis. When we compared results from patients who initiated dialysis two weeks after catheter insertion, patients who initiated dialysis urgently were more likely to have leakage of dialysis fluid outside the abdominal cavity into the skin near the exit site of peritoneal dialysis catheter. The differences in infection of the lining of the abdomen (peritonitis), infection at the exit point of the peritoneal dialysis catheter (exit-site infection), mechanical complications of peritoneal dialysis (including catheter blockage, catheter malposition and catheter readjustment), patients remaining on peritoneal dialysis (technique survival), and death between patients who started dialysis urgently and those who waited for two weeks after catheter insertion remain unclear. In patients with chronic kidney disease who require dialysis urgently without ready-to-use dialysis access in place, peritoneal dialysis may increase dialysate leak. However, the overall risks of infectious and other non-infectious complications between urgent-start peritoneal dialysis and conventional-start peritoneal dialysis remains unclear.
We wanted to find out if hearing protection fit testing plus training to wear earplugs (or other protection devices) properly is effective at reducing noise experienced by workers, and whether they continued to wear earplugs consistently. We also wanted to find out if people’s age, gender, earplug type, and experience of using hearing protection devices made any differences to the effectiveness of fit testing and training. We found 3 studies involving 756 participants. They examined the effects of giving people simple or extensive instructions for fitting their hearing protection devices (all the studies used foam or premoulded earplugs) together with fit tests that measured how much noise was reduced. We did not find any studies that examined whether fit testing and training promoted consistent hearing protection use, nor any studies that examined whether age, gender, or hearing protection experience influenced noise reduction. • Earplug fit testing accompanied by simple instructions probably does not improve personal attenuation ratings (PAR) from foam and premoulded earplugs compared to no instructions.
• Fit testing with extensive instructions probably improves workers’ protection against noise, measured immediately after the test and training, compared to having no or simple instructions. An increase in protection of about 3 dB will halve the sound's power at the ear, increasing the protective effect of earplugs.
• The effects of fit testing may depend on the type of hearing protection device and training methods.
• None of the included studies measured or reported harmful effects from fit testing and training, and we did not think it was likely we would find any. We have moderate to low confidence in the evidence. Our confidence was reduced because the studies were small, and we had concerns about how participants were allocated to groups. The evidence is current to February 2024.
Only one study met criteria for inclusion. In this one selected trial, authors did not carry out statistical analyses on the absolute change from baseline, but on the percentage change from the baseline score. Taking into account the difficulties in evaluating a single trial, at present there is no indication for treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with indomethacin.
No studies comparing vitamin A or other retinoid supplements to placebo (dummy drug containing no vitamin A) were included, but we did find one study comparing beta-carotene supplementation (a precursor of vitamin A) to placebo. A total of 24 people with cystic fibrosis (aged 6.7 to 27.7 years) were put into groups at random and treated either with β-carotene capsules (at a high dose for three months followed by a low dose for a further three months) or with placebo (for six months). No studies on vitamin A supplementation were included in this review.
The single included study revealed that high-dose beta-carotene supplementation for three months led to fewer days on which people with CF required antibiotics compared to placebo, but this was not the case in the following three-month section of the study when low-dose beta-carotene supplementation was compared to placebo. Other clinical outcome measures (growth, nutritional status and lung function) showed no statistical significant differences between treatment and placebo groups. No side effects were observed. The other outcomes in this review, such as vitamin A deficiency symptoms, mortality, toxicity and quality of life, were not reported. We could only include one study in this review and that study had several limitations. This is reflected in the assessment of low-quality evidence, judged using the specific evidence grading system (GRADE). So, we feel that the strength of evidence is low. Not all outcome measures were reported after each supplementation dose and results should be viewed with some caution as some beta-carotene from the high-dose period was probably still present in the blood during the low-dose supplementation period. Since no studies on vitamin A supplementation were included in the review, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the routine use of vitamin A supplements. Due to limitations of the included study of beta-carotene supplementation, no definitive conclusions regarding its use can be drawn either. Until further evidence is available, local guidelines should be followed regarding supplementation.
The evidence is current to November 2015.
We found two small studies involving 116 children that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies gave children a combination of omega-3 and omega-6 capsules as the intervention for three months. Most of these studies involved boys between 10 and 18 years of age - one was conducted in a school setting, and the other at a specialised clinic. One of the studies was funded by the company that supplied the omega-3 and omega-6 supplements.
Another study could not be included in this review because investigators added carnosine (an amino acid that is highly concentrated in the brain) to the PUFAs. Carnosine and PUFAs might have similar effects, so it would not be possible to separate the effects of the two ingredients. Review authors excluded five studies because it was not confirmed that a specific learning disorder was diagnosed in these children. None of the included studies reported effects of PUFAs on reading, writing, spelling or mathematical abilities of children.
Evidence of low quality (because studies included few participants and showed evidence of bias) suggests that using PUFAs did not increase the risk of minor disturbances to the digestive system. Included studies reported no other types of adverse effects.
Both studies reported on ADHD-related behaviour. However, the format of available data did not allow us to readily combine them or to reach any conclusions. Included studies reported no other secondary outcomes. Evidence is not sufficient to support or refute the use of PUFAs in children with specific learning disorders.
Nine studies were reviewed. The studies compared TNF-alpha blocking agents with placebo (inactive intravenous infusions or injections) and found that infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol were effective in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease who respond to induction therapy with these agents. There is no evidence that CDP571 is an effective maintenance therapy. The TNF-alpha blocking agents appear to be safe for patients with Crohn's disease with equal numbers of patients receiving TNF-alpha blocking agents or placebo reporting side effects such as headache, abdominal pain, nausea, and pain at injection site. There were some serious side effects reported with the use of these agents including infections such as tuberculosis. However, patients can be screened for inactive tuberculosis prior to treatment with TNF-alpha. A link between long term treatment with TNF-alpha blocking agents and cancer is possible but not proven. Data obtained from observational studies including the Crohn's Therapy, Resource, Evaluation and Assessment Tool (TREAT) registry show no increased risk of cancer with the use of TNF-alpha blocking agents in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The current evidence suggests that the TNF-alpha blocking agents infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol are effective maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. However, the use of these medications needs to be weighed against the potential risk of serious side effects, particularly infection.
In detailed searches of the medical literature, we found six trials that were suitable for inclusion in our analysis, that together included 460 adults. All six trials were conducted in an approved statistical manner (randomised and double-blinded); however, all had limitations that could lead to an overestimation of efficacy in treating this type of pain. Four were of very small size and five were of short duration, both of which can bias the results of chronic pain trials. Although it was not possible to combine the results of all trials to make an overall conclusion, individually they did all show some, albeit moderate, benefit for venlafaxine in treating neuropathic pain. Usually this benefit was achieved at doses of 75 to 225 mg per day. Known side effects of venlafaxine, including sleepiness, dizziness, and mild gastrointestinal problems, were reported by some studies, but were not particularly problematic.
Overall, there is currently an inadequate amount of information available to warrant any change in current prescribing practice and we cannot recommend venlafaxine as a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain. However, it is a reasonably well-tolerated drug and may be of some benefit in people who cannot tolerate other antidepressants or anticonvulsant drugs that are more widely prescribed to people with neuropathic pain. Larger clinical trials may provide more robust evidence for the effectiveness of venlafaxine in treating neuropathic pain.
We searched for evidence on 15 July 2015 and included four randomised controlled studies with 4608, women but only two of the studies had useable data. We assessed both studies contributing outcome data as being at a high risk of bias. One study compared the effect of the baby suckling immediately after birth with no intervention. Another study compared nipple stimulation (with a breast pump) versus oxytocin injection. Neither study reported postpartum haemorrhage. Side effects of the treatments were not reported. Similarly, there was limited information on other consequences for women and their babies.
When comparing nipple stimulation (suckling) with no breastfeeding, there were no clear differences in terms of the number of maternal deaths. The incidence of severe maternal illness was not reported. One woman in the suckling group died as a result of a retained placenta. Blood loss greater than or equal to 500 mL, retained placenta, perinatal deaths and maternal readmission to hospital were not clearly different between those who breast fed and those who did not. While these data were based on a single study with a reasonable sample size (4227 women), the results were mostly of low or very low quality due to concerns related to data analysis and study methodology.
Our comparison of nipple stimulation (using a breast pump) versus oxytocin included one small study involving 85 women only. There was no clear difference between the groups in relation to blood loss or postnatal anaemia. These results were of low quality due to our concerns about the way the trial was conducted and its small size. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of nipple stimulation for reducing bleeding during the third stage of labour and more evidence from high-quality studies is warranted. Future randomised clinical trials, with sufficient sample sizes should assess the impact of nipple stimulation in comparison to agents that stimulate the uterus such as syntometrine or oxytocin alone and report on important outcomes such as those listed in this review.
This update included 33 randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 7296 participants. Treatments included rivaroxaban (a medicine called a direct oral inhibitor of activated factor X), injections of medicines under the skin to prevent blood clotting (e.g. fondaparinux, low molecular weight heparin, or unfractionated heparin), elastic compression stockings, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; a pain killer medicine), topical treatment (medicine applied to the skin), and surgery.
One large study, accounting for half of the participants included in the review, showed that treatment with fondaparinux for 45 days was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE (where symptoms indicate there is a VTE), ST extension (where the clot moves further up the leg), and recurrence of ST (where clots return) compared to placebo. Major bleeding was infrequent in both groups. In one study in people with ST at high risk of recurrent thromboembolic events, fondaparinux was associated with a non-significant reduction of symptomatic VTE compared to rivaroxaban. There were no major bleeding events in either group. Both low molecular weight heparin and NSAIDs reduced the occurrence of extension or recurrence of ST with no effect on symptomatic VTE or major bleeding. Topical treatments relieved local symptoms but the trials did not report on progression to VTE. Surgical treatment and wearing elastic stockings were associated with a lower rate of VTE and progression of the ST compared with elastic stockings alone. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low for most treatments due to poor study design, imprecision of results, lack of a placebo (non-treated) group and only one study in some comparison. The quality of evidence was low to moderate for comparisons in two placebo-controlled trials.
In conclusion, fondaparinux appears to be an adequate treatment for most people with ST. The optimal dose and duration of treatment need to be established in people at high risk as well as people at low risk for recurrent thrombotic events. Further research is needed to assess the role of rivaroxaban and other such medicines, or thrombin, low molecular weight heparin or NSAIDs and to demonstrate the effectiveness, if any, of topical treatment, or surgery in terms of VTE.
We looked at the effects of these interventions on COVID-19 infection rate, absenteeism, COVID-19-related death, and adverse events. We searched for studies that looked at interventions based on the following four categories:
• elimination of exposure (e.g. self-isolation strategies);
• engineering controls (e.g. barriers to separate or distance coworkers, and workers from members of the public);
• administrative controls (e.g. working from home);
• personal protective equipment (e.g. use of face masks or other types of face covering).
We included studies of any worker outside the healthcare setting. We placed no restrictions on language or publication period in our search. We screened more than 13,000 reports in the initial phase and more than 10,000 in this updated review, and included two studies with a total of 16,014 participants. One study was conducted in England, UK from 18 March 2021 to 27 June 2021, and the other in Sicily and Calabria, Italy, from 1 April 2020 to 31 December 2020. The UK-based study (Young 2021) enrolled more than 24,000 workers. In the 76 schools in the control group (standard isolation), staff who were considered COVID-19 contacts through contact tracing were required to self-isolate at home for 10 days. In the 86 schools in the intervention group (test-based attendance), staff who were considered COVID-19 contacts through contact tracing were not required to isolate, instead taking a daily rapid test (lateral flow antigen test) for seven days. If the rapid test was negative, the staff member could go to work. If the rapid test was positive, the staff member would self-isolate. The researchers wanted to know if there was a difference in COVID-related absence between the two methods. The Italian study (Vitale 2022) was conducted in two large retail companies. Workers from the intervention company included sales clerks, warehouse workers, and butchers or bakers (n = 1987). A similar company served as a control group (n = 1798). Workers in the intervention group had to stay at home or leave work immediately in the presence of fever or flu-like symptoms, measure body temperature and oxygen saturation at workplace entry, and get tested after close contact with a COVID-19 case. The control group followed the standard procedures, which involved measuring body temperature at home and cleaning the workplace after a COVID-19 case was confirmed. Both groups wore protective equipment such as gloves or masks. However, the study did not report any results that were of interest to this review.
After analysing the data from Young 2021, we are uncertain whether a strategy of test-based attendance changes COVID-19 infection rates (any infection; symptomatic infection) compared with routine isolation after contact with a person with COVID-19. However, COVID-19-related absence may be lower or similar in the test-based attendance group. We are uncertain about these findings, because the number of infections was very low amongst the participants. Death, adverse events, quality of life, and hospitalisation were not measured. Additionally, 71% of the test-based attendance group followed the strategy; however, the researchers did not report on compliance for the standard isolation group.
We identified a total of eight ongoing studies. Seven of these studies plan to address the effects of interventions aimed at eliminating the risk of getting infected, and one study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a recombinant Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (rBCG) vaccine in preventing COVID-19 infection and reducing disease severity. We have very little or little confidence in the evidence because of missing data and not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes. This Cochrane review is an update of the original review published in May 2022. For the current version of the review we searched for studies up to 13 April 2023.
The review of 21 trials (2588 patients) found that the tested drugs did not reduce deaths. There was a small reduction in the need for blood transfusions, corresponding to one half unit of blood saved per patient. It is doubtful whether this effect is worthwhile.
Individual randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that antidepressants are effective for OCD. This review summarises all the available evidence for one class of antidepressant drugs, the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (including citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline) compared to placebo in the treatment of OCD in adults. The review included 17 studies (3097 participants), and showed that SSRIs were effective in reducing the symptoms of OCD. Based on 13 studies (2697 participants), the review showed that people receiving SSRIs were nearly twice as likely as those receiving placebo to achieve clinical response (defined as a 25% or more reduction in symptoms). Indirect comparisons of effectiveness suggested that although individual SSRI drugs were similar in their effectiveness, they differed in terms of their adverse effects. The most common adverse effect reported by participants was nausea. Further studies involving head to head comparisons between different SSRI drugs are required to obtain more reliable information on differences between SSRIs, both in terms of effectiveness and adverse effects.
We looked for randomised controlled trials to find out what might work best for women. However, we did not find any studies for inclusion in this review. So, there remains the problem of how best to care for pregnant women and women planning a pregnancy in these circumstances. Trials are urgently needed, although conducting such studies might be difficult. In the meantime, caregivers will do their best to look after these women during pregnancy and childbirth.
We searched the literature until November 2013. We included in the review 69 trials that randomly assigned 7863 participants . Participants were hospitalized with urinary tract, intra-abdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia and infections of unknown source. One set of studies compared a broad-spectrum beta lactam versus a different, generally narrower-spectrum beta lactam combined with an aminoglycoside (47 studies). No clear difference in all-cause deaths was observed, but treatment failures were fewer with single beta lactam antibiotic treatment. A significant survival advantage was seen with single therapy in studies that involved infections of unknown source. The other studies compared one beta lactam versus the same beta lactam combined with an aminoglycoside antibiotic (22 studies). In these trials, no differences between single and combination antibiotic treatments were seen. Overall, adverse event rates did not differ between the study groups, but renal damage was more frequent with the combination therapy. Combination therapy did not prevent the development of secondary infection.
The review authors concluded that beta lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy does not provide an advantage over beta lactams alone. Furthermore, combination therapy was associated with an increased risk of renal damage. The limited number of trials comparing the same beta lactam in both study arms and the fact that more than a third of the studies did not report on all-cause deaths may limit these conclusions. The subgroup of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections was underpowered to examine effects.
The recommendations in this review are based on a critical analysis of the available evidence in the medical literature. We found only one, relatively small, randomised controlled trial of steroids in TON, which included 31 participants within seven days of their initial injury. These participants received either high dose intravenous steroids (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15). At three months follow-up, no significant difference in best corrected visual acuity was found between these two groups. There is a relatively high rate of spontaneous visual recovery in TON and no convincing data that steroids provide any additional benefit over observation alone. Each case needs to be assessed on an individual basis and the patient needs to be made fully aware of the possibility of a serious adverse reaction, although rare, to steroids. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted possible detrimental effects of steroids when used in brain and spinal cord injuries and these new lines of evidence need to be considered seriously.
This review looks at studies that compare the regular use for at least four weeks of different types of inhaled short-acting bronchodilator medication in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, or emphysema/chronic bronchitis). There were eleven trials included. There were no major differences seen between the responses to ipratropium and salbutamol, or the combination. Where there were benefits, they were small and would not support a general recommendation for the use of ipratropium bromide or a combination with beta-2 agonist over a beta-2 agonist alone in COPD. People with COPD could use the short-acting bronchodilator that gives them the most improvement in their symptoms.
One of these drugs is bevacizumab (Avastin) which has been studied in clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer. Trials with other drugs are ongoing. Data are available from seven randomised trials, which evaluated the effect of bevacizumab on the primary endpoint in a total of 4032 patients with metastatic breast cancer. These patients were either-hormone receptor negative or had progressed on hormonal treatment. The primary end point was progression-free survival and secondary end points included overall survival, response rate measuring the change in size of the tumour, quality of life and toxicity of the treatment. Progression-free survival is considered a surrogate end point, i.e. a substitute for overall survival as an end point. The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy significantly prolongs progression-free survival and response rates in patients who have had previous chemotherapy and those who have not had previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The magnitude of this benefit is dependent on the type of chemotherapy used. Best results have been observed for the combination of weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab in patients without prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Although progression-free survival was significantly longer with bevacizumab, there was no significant effect observed on either overall survival or quality of life. Quality of life is a direct measure of benefit to the patient. Adverse effects of bevacizumab in breast cancer are generally manageable, but may be serious and include increased frequencies of high blood pressure, blood clots in arteries and bowel perforations. However, overall rates of treatment-related deaths were lower in patients treated with bevacizumab. Because of the lack of effect on overall survival and quality of life, it is regarded as controversial whether bevacizumab is associated with a true patient benefit in spite of the increase in progression-free survival.
In November 2017, we searched for clinical trials where ketorolac was used to treat pain after surgery in children. We found 13 studies, enrolling 920 children, that met our requirements for the review. The studies were quite different in their design, the dose of ketorolac, the timing (during or after surgery) and number of doses given, the type of surgery, and to what ketorolac was compared (either a placebo (a dummy treatment, such as a bag of fluid) or another drug). There was not enough information for a statistical analysis of the assessments in which we were most interested, that is, the number of children with at least 50% pain relief; or the average pain intensity (a measure of a patient's pain that asks the patient to rate how much pain they have, often on a scale of 0 for 'no pain' to 10 for 'worst pain imaginable'). Four studies individually reported that ketorolac was better at reducing pain intensity than placebo, but the studies were small and had various design issues. There was more information for other assessments, such as the number of children who needed rescue medication (additional pain medication that is given if the study medication is not helping the person's pain sufficiently), and how much of this rescue medication was used. Fewer children needed rescue medication in the ketorolac group than those who received placebo, although the result was not statistically different. During the four hours after they received study medications, children receiving ketorolac needed slightly less rescue pain medication than those who had received placebo. There was not enough information about ketorolac in direct comparisons with other medications.
There was also not enough information in the studies for us to make a good assessment of side effects and serious side effects when ketorolac was used in this setting. Serious side effects in those receiving ketorolac included bleeding, but it didn't occur often enough for us to make any firm conclusions. Very few children dropped out of the studies because of side effects. This is normal in studies where participants are only in the study for a short period of time. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low, due to methodological issues with many of the studies, differences in study designs, and low overall numbers of children enrolled. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results.
This review aims to assess the effectiveness of pericyazine in the treatment of schizophrenia compared to older and newer antipsychotics.A search for studies was carried out in 2013 and five studies conducted between 1965 and 1980 were found and included in the review. The quality of evidence was rated by the authors to be very low, and their results were imprecise for many outcomes where they compared pericyazine and other older and newer antipsychotic drugs. The evidence is inadequate to determine whether pericyazine is better than other antipsychotics.
The results of the analysis for the outcome of improvement were imprecise and the authors could not be certain that more people who took pericyazine were found to have not improved compared with those who took typical antipsychotics. More side effects, such as involuntary shaking, tremors, restlessness and spasms, were experienced by people who took pericyazine than other typical or atypical antipsychotics. These side effects are very unpleasant and the increased occurrence of them compared to other antipsychotics is an important finding considering pericyazine may not have additional benefits for the symptoms of schizophrenia.
No studies reported outcomes on satisfaction of treatment or cost effectiveness, which require attention. This lack of evidence leaves people with schizophrenia, mental health professionals and policy makers with little information on the benefits, hazards or problems of pericyazine. Outcomes on the cost of care and satisfaction with treatment should be included in future trials which should also be larger, better conducted, and fully reported.
(This plain language summary has been written by Ben Gray from Rethink Mental Illness).
Our search identified ten trials with a total of 1087 participants. Reviewers judged the overall methodological quality of these studies as moderate.
Data from three studies comparing endovascular revascularisation with no specific treatment for intermittent claudication except advice to exercise showed a moderate to large effect on walking distances in favour of endovascular revascularisation in the short term. However after long-term follow up in two studies, this short-term advantage of endovascular revascularisation had disappeared. The number of additional surgical procedures was not different between groups. One study reported no differences in disease-specific quality of life after two years.
Data from five studies comparing endovascular revascularisation with supervised exercise for intermittent claudication showed both therapies to be more or less comparable in terms of improving walking distances, number of additional surgical procedures, and quality of life.
Data from three studies comparing a combination therapy of endovascular revascularisation plus supervised exercise versus supervised exercise alone showed no clear differences between groups for walking distances in the short term, and data from one study showed a large effect on walking distances in favour of combination therapy over the long term. Disease-specific quality of life was comparable between study groups. The number of additional surgical procedures was lower following combination therapy.
Finally, when comparing a combination therapy of endovascular revascularisation plus drug therapy with cilostazol versus drug therapy alone, two studies provided data showing small to moderate effects on walking distance and on quality of life in favour of the combination therapy. The number of additional surgical procedures was comparable between study groups. Overall, reviewers rated the quality of evidence for outcomes in the comparison of endovascular revascularisation versus no specific therapy for intermittent claudication as low to moderate mainly owing to small study sample sizes and the possibility of serious risk of bias in these studies. For comparisons of endovascular revascularisation versus conservative therapy, and the combination therapy of endovascular revascularisation and conservative therapy versus conservative therapy alone, reviewers generally rated the quality of evidence for outcomes as moderate to high mainly owing to substantial differences between studies. This review assessed results reported by a limited number of studies showing that endovascular revascularisation and supervised exercise are more or less comparable treatment options in improving walking distances and quality of life among individuals with intermittent claudication. Combination therapy (endovascular revascularisation with either supervised exercise or drug therapy (cilostazol)) seems to result in greater improvements in walking distance and in quality of life than are seen with supervised exercise or drug therapy alone.
We reviewed a total of eight studies involving 262 participants between the ages of five and 18 years with well-controlled asthma. They underwent swimming training varying from 30 to 90 minutes two to three times a week over six to 12 weeks in seven studies, and in one study training lasted 30 minutes six times per week.
This review found that for swimming training compared to control (either usual care or another physical activity), there were improvements in resting lung function tests, but no effects were found on quality of life, control of asthma symptoms or asthma exacerbations. Physical fitness increased with swimming training compared with usual care. There were few reported adverse asthmatic events in swimming training participants during the programmes. The relatively small number of studies and participants limits this review’s ability to measure some outcomes that are of interest, particularly the impact on quality of life and  asthma exacerbations.
In summary, swimming training is well-tolerated in children and adolescents with stable asthma, and increases physical fitness and lung function. However, whether swimming is better and/or safer than other forms of physical activity cannot be determined from this review. Further studies with longer follow-up periods may help us understand any long-term benefits of swimming.
Our aim was to find out what is important when introducing, running and receiving care from Hospital at Home services. We wanted to explore a range of experiences of, and views on, Admission Avoidance and Early Discharge services. These might include things that managers want to know when planning to set up a Hospital at Home service, healthcare professionals’ views on working in a Hospital at Home service, what matters to patients who receive this type of care, or how family and caregivers experience Hospital at Home services for those they care for. We searched for research that had explored experiences, attitudes or beliefs about Hospital at Home services from the perspectives of patients, caregivers, health professionals, managers and health funders. The studies addressed existing Hospital at Home services and those that were being set up, for people with a range of conditions, such as stroke, pneumonia or following surgery. The studies used interviews or focus groups to explore the views of people involved in delivering or receiving Hospital at Home services. We assessed and summarised the findings from each of the studies. We identified important findings across the studies, and then rated how confident we were in each finding. This confidence (or trust) depended on, for example, how much information relating to a particular finding had been provided in the studies. We found 52 studies that explored Hospital at Home services, including 31 Early Discharge, 16 Admission Avoidance and five combined Early Discharge and Admission Avoidance services. These studies conducted interviews or focus groups with 662 healthcare staff, 900 patients, 417 caregivers and eight health funders.
In total, we identified 12 main findings after assessing all the studies. We grouped these findings as: (1) development of stakeholder relationships and systems prior to implementation, (2) processes, resources and skills required for safe and effective delivery, (3) acceptability and caregiver impacts and (4) sustainability of services. We are confident in most of our findings, but we are less confident in a few findings, mainly due to the small numbers of studies and interviews with health funders contributing to the review finding. All except one of the studies came from high-income countries, and so our findings may not apply to low- and middle-income countries. Some studies did not report all the information that might be useful. For example, services’ staffing and role types were not always included. The evidence is up-to-date to November 2022.
We performed a search which included studies up to 20 December 2017. We identified two randomised clinical trials (where participants are divided by chance into the trial groups) which met the requirements for our review and followed-up the participants for at least two years. We identified 19 further observational studies from which we were able to report some findings on harms in a narrative form. The randomised trials included 107 infants who were given glucocorticosteroids and 104 who were given placebo. Trials were funded by charities, public organisations, and received support from private sector companies, all of which did not seem to have any interest in the outcome of the respective trials. The included trials outlined their sources of funding, and the review authors deemed that there were no conflicts of interest. Review authors did not receive funding to carry out this review. We did not find any differences between the groups of infants treated with glucocorticosteroids compared with placebo in terms of mortality, adverse events, ability to clear jaundice, or need for a liver transplant. We assessed the two trials as having low risk of bias (we had no concerns that their design and reporting may deviate from the truth), but they were at high risk of imprecision (inexact evaluations of outcomes). They used different categories for adverse events, and we were unable to combine the data from the trials. We could not include enough infants in our analyses (only two published trials) in order to detect small differences between the two intervention groups. The certainty of the evidence was low for mortality, adverse events, ability to clear jaundice, or need for a liver transplant outcomes. One further ongoing trial was identified, with no currently available results. We need further randomised clinical trials that compare glucocorticosteroids with placebo in order to find out if glucocorticosteroids are of benefit in the postoperative management of infants with biliary atresia. Such trials need to be conducted at different clinical centres.
This review included eight trials in which 2156 patients with breast cancer had randomly received CSFs or placebo or no treatment during chemotherapy. These trials were carried out between 1995 and 2008. Prophylactic treatment with CSFs significantly reduced the risk of developing FN by 73%. The estimated number of patients needed to be treated with CSFs in order to prevent one event of FN was 12. Although a significant decrease in mortality of all causes during chemotherapy and CSF therapy was noted, there was no reduction in infection-related mortality. There was no significant effect observed that planned chemotherapy schedules could be better maintained if CSFs were administered or that the number of patients with neutropenia decreased with CSFs. Notably, CSFs significantly reduced the need for hospital care yet frequently caused short-term adverse effects like bone pain and injection-site reactions. There were several limitations in this analysis: only a few trials could be included, the number of patients was low in many of these trials, and disease stages and chemotherapy treatments varied considerably. Moreover, the trial authors defined their outcomes differently, making comparisons across studies difficult. Information on the primary and secondary outcomes could not be obtained from all trials and the overall reporting quality was low. Many studies were dated and hence the administration of CSFs did not comply with current recommendations. Overall, CSFs have shown moderate evidence of beneﬁt in the prevention of FN in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. The evidence that the administration of CSFs could reduce early mortality of all causes was weak and substantiates the need of further studies. There was no reduction in risk of infection-related mortality with CSF treatment.
This review examined the effectiveness of FP when given at different doses for treating asthma in children and adults. High doses (800 to 1000 microgram per day) led to small improvements in measures of airway opening compared to low doses (50 to 100 microgram per day) in people with mild to moderate asthma. High dose FP did not lead to clear improvements in symptoms over the lower dose and increased the risk of a hoarse voice and fungal mouth infections. In people with severe asthma, very high doses FP (2000 microgram per day) appeared to allow more people on oral steroids to stop or reduce their dose of oral steroid tablets compared to lower doses of FP (1000 to 1500 microgram per day).
The evidence is current to June 2014. The review included 18 studies with a total of 1250 women who had myomectomy for uterine fibroids. All studies compared an intervention to reduce bleeding during myomectomy with either a placebo or no such treatment. The data available suggest that vaginal insertion of misoprostol and infiltration of vasopressin into the uterine muscle are effective in reducing bleeding during myomectomy. Limited data available also suggest that chemical dissection (such as with mesna), vaginal insertion of dinoprostone, a gelatin-thrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, infusion of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) during surgery, infiltration of a mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine into the uterine muscles, the use of fibrin sealant patch (a surgical patch that improves blood clotting) or a tourniquet around the cervix or around both the cervix and the infundibulopelvic ligamentmay be effective in reducing bleeding during myomectomy. We found limited information on the harms (adverse effects) of the different interventions. There is moderate-quality evidence that misoprostol reduces blood loss by between 70.24 ml and 125.52 ml; with a laparotomy vasopressin reduces blood loss by between 392.51 and 507.49 ml during myomectomy, and by between 121.73 ml and 172.17 ml during laparoscopic myomectomy. There is low-quality evidence for the rest of the interventions (chemical dissection, dinoprostone, gelatin-thrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, vitamin C, mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine, a fibrin sealant patch and the two types of tourniquet).
Nine trials involving 1752 women were included in the review. The trials with low risk of bias found that phenobarbital given to women immediately prior to a very preterm birth did not decrease the risk of bleeding in the brains of the babies. No differences in child development were found on follow up at 18 to 24 months or at seven years.
Maternal sedation was more likely in women receiving phenobarbital. The use of prenatal corticosteroids, known to reduce rates of periventricular haemorrhage, varied between trials and may have influenced findings.
The review found that there is currently no reliable evidence that OT improves outcomes for people with MS, although there was some suggestion that fatigue might be improved.
We identified four studies (including 206 participants) that investigated the effectiveness of technology-based interventions to rehabilitate children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury. All four studies were conducted in North America, with three originating from the same research team.
One study with 120 participants used an online Counselor-Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS) intervention to rehabilitate executive functioning in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.
One study with 35 participants used a Teen Online Problem-Solving intervention to target the executive functioning of adolescents aged 11 to 18 years.
One study with 40 participants used an online Family Problem Solving intervention to target outcomes such as behaviour and aspects of executive functioning in children aged 5 to 16 years.
One study with 12 participants used a computer program to target cognitive-communication skills including memory and aspects of executive functions in adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 21 years. All funding sources were in the USA or Canada. One study was funded by the Colorado Department of Human Services and two National Institutes of Health (NIH) awards. A second study was also funded by a NIH grant. One study was funded by a hospital charity in addition to the Easter Seal Research Institute and Apple Canada. The final study was supported by the Ohio Department of Safety. This review found evidence that interventions employing technological aids did improve executive functions in adolescents with traumatic brain injury (i.e. a brain injury resulting from a road traffic accident, fall, or blow to the head). However, this result was relatively modest and is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the child. One study employed technology to improve memory in adolescents with TBI and showed an improvement for the intervention group. It was not possible to determine how effective this approach was as the study failed to include adequate statistical information. Two studies examined the secondary outcomes of anxiety and depression but did not show any effect between the intervention and control groups at 6 months follow-up. Only one study recorded adverse events, and reported that none occurred. Two studies reported on the amount of use the intervention received. One study reported improvements in social functioning/social competence for the intervention group. No data were reported which related to the review's other secondary outcomes. We found the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be low, which means future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. All four studies were small, and it was not always possible to conceal group allocation to participants. Three studies failed to conceal group allocation to those who measured the outcomes.
The review looked for randomised studies to assess the impact of dieting or exercise, or both, on women's weight loss in the months after giving birth. It paid particular attention to breastfeeding women to be sure that breastfeeding was not compromised. The review of trials found 14 studies, with 12 studies involving 910 women carrying excess weight after childbirth that contributed data for analysis. The findings suggest that diet combined with exercise or diet alone compared with usual care seemed to help with weight loss after giving birth. There is potential for these interventions to play a role in preventing future maternal obesity. There was not sufficient evidence to be sure that exercise or diet did not interfere with breastfeeding though it appeared not to in the included studies. It seems preferable to lose weight through a combination of dieting and exercise, compared to dieting alone, because exercise is thought to improve circulation and heart fitness, and to preserve lean body mass. Further research is needed.
The review included two trials with 69 people (aged one to 55 years) with severe haemophilia with inhibitors. Both trials compared recombinant factor VIIa with activated prothrombin complex concentrate and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. We found two clinical trials comparing Novoseven®and FEIBA®. The trials did not show a difference in how well the two products worked and both were tolerated equally well with no clotting complications. We conclude that both recombinant factor VIIa and plasma-derived concentrates can be used to treat bleeds in people with haemophilia and inhibitors. There were some major problems with regards to the way both trials were designed, in relation to knowing which treatment group each person was in (both before the trial was started and during) and also how missing results were handled.
The review identified seven trials involving 8013 women. Fetal pulse oximetry plus CTG showed no difference in caesarean section rates overall, nor any difference in the mother's or newborn's health, compared with CTG alone. If there was concern about the baby's well-being before the fetal pulse oximetry probe was placed, the use of fetal pulse oximetry reduced caesarean sections performed for the baby's well-being. The one trial of oximetry with CTG compared with CTG and fetal ECG showed an increase in the caesarean rate in the oximetry group. In two of the trials, the company making the fetal pulse oximetry machines provided some funding. A better method than fetal pulse oximetry is needed for checking on the well-being of the baby during labour.
Nine studies were included in the review and evaluated eight different treatment modalities. In one small study of short duration (4 months), it was shown that the use of locally applied antibiotics in addition to the deep manual cleaning of the diseased implants decreased the depth of the pockets around the implants by an additional 0.6 mm in patients affected by severe forms of peri-implantitis. In another small study of 4-year duration, it was shown that placing an animal-derived bone substitute with a resorbable barrier decreased the depth of the pockets by an additional 1.4 mm than synthetic bone. The majority of trials testing more complex and expensive therapies did not show any statistically or clinically significant advantages over the deep mechanical cleaning around the affected implants. In conclusion, at present, there is too little evidence to determine which is the most effective way to treat peri-implantitis. This is not to say that currently used interventions are not effective.
The literature was searched up to 28 January 2019. Four studies involving 1485 patients compared certolizumab pegol with placebo (a dummy drug). All studies included patients with active Crohn’s disease. Most patients were adults over 18 years of age, except for six patients aged 16 or 17 years old. All studies were funded by the drug manufacturer. In a combined analysis of the four studies, patients with active Crohn’s disease who received certolizumab pegol at a dose ranging from 100 mg to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks, responded to the treatment and achieved remission at 8 weeks more often than patients taking placebo. No remarkable difference in the rate of serious side effects was observed between certolizumab pegol and placebo. Serious side effects included worsening Crohn's disease, infections, and malignancy (i.e. cancer). Moderate certainty evidence suggests that certolizumab pegol is beneficial in terms of achieving remission in people with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Because of a low number of serious side effects, the certainty of evidence about harms of certolizumab pegol was moderate. Moderate certainty evidence suggests that certolizumab pegol is effective for induction of clinical remission and clinical response in people with active Crohn's disease. It is uncertain whether the risk of serious side effects differs between certolizumab pegol and placebo. Future studies are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits and harms of certolizumab pegol in people with Crohn's disease.
We searched medical databases and found three studies involving 1694 participants (CAMMS223, CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II). CAMMS223 involved people with previously untreated, early RRMS. Participants received either subcutaneous (under the skin) interferon beta 1a (at a dose of 44 μg) three times per week or annual intravenous (into a vein) courses of alemtuzumab (at a dose of either 12 mg per day or 24 mg per day) for 36 months. CARE-MS I enrolled adults aged 18 to 50 years with previously untreated RRMS. Participants received annual intravenous courses of alemtuzumab 12 mg per day or subcutaneous interferon beta 1a 44 μg three times per week for 24 months. CARE-MS II enrolled adults aged 18 to 55 years with RRMS and at least one relapse while on interferon beta or glatiramer (another medicine that alters the immune response) treatment. Participants received subcutaneous interferon beta 1a 44 μg three times per week, annual intravenous courses of alemtuzumab 12 mg per day or annual intravenous courses of alemtuzumab 24 mg per day for 24 months. The evidence is current to 1 February 2017. The review of trials found that, compared with subcutaneous interferon beta 1a three times per week, annual intravenous cycles of alemtuzumab probably reduces the proportion of participants who experience relapse, may reduce the proportion of participants who experience disability worsening and development of new T2 lesions on MRI. In one study, alemtuzumab 24 mg leads to slightly better EDSS scores when compared with interferon beta 1a.
The rates of adverse events were similarly high for both treatments. The most frequently reported adverse events for both treatments were infusion-associated reactions, infections and autoimmune events. The use of alemtuzumab requires careful monitoring so that potentially serious adverse events can be treated early and effectively. The quality of the body of evidence obtained for each outcome is mainly low except for the number of participants experiencing at least one relapse for which the quality of evidence was moderate.
This review includes 17 studies involving a total of 451 children with a mean age range between 4 and 14 years. All children had cerebral palsy. We found four studies comparing mechanically assisted walking without body weight support to no walking; two studies comparing mechanically assisted walking without body weight support to the same amount of overground walking; eight studies comparing mechanically assisted walking plus body weight support to no walking; and three studies comparing mechanically assisted walking with body weight support to the same amount of overground walking. Mechanically assisted training was provided for 15 to 40 minutes a session, two to five times a week, for 4 to 12 weeks. Five studies were funded by a grant, and one study was funded by two different grants. Eight studies did not report funding information, and three studies received no funding support.
The evidence is current to January 2020. Mechanically assisted walking without body weight support
1. Compared with no walking, there was a small benefit in terms of walking speed and gross motor function (skills needed to control the large muscles of the body used in walking). In one study, there was no difference between groups in terms of adverse events (undesirable outcomes).
2. Compared with the same amount of overground walking, there was a small benefit in terms of walking speed, gross motor function, and participation. No study reported adverse event rates.
Mechanically assisted walking with body weight support
1. Compared with no walking, there was a small benefit in terms of walking speed but no clear difference in terms of gross motor function, participation, or adverse events.
2. Compared with the same amount of overground walking, there was no benefit in terms of walking speed, gross motor function, or participation. No study reported adverse events. Moderate- and low-quality evidence suggests that the use of mechanically assisted walking without body weight support may result in small improvements in walking speed and gross motor function, compared to both no walking and the same amount of overground walking. For mechanically assisted walking with body weight support, benefits were seen in walking speed and gross motor function compared to no walking, but not the same amount of overground walking. Not many studies reported adverse events, although those that did appear to show no differences between groups. Mechanically assisted walking can provide high-dose, repetitive training. It may be a useful way to provide practice for younger children with poor concentration when it is hard to apply the same dose of overground walking.
We searched medical databases for studies in which neither participants nor researchers were told which treatment was given (called a randomised double-blind trial). The effectiveness and safety of IVIG were considered in terms of the occurrence of significant disability at six months after hospital discharge and the proportion of children experiencing at least one serious side effect. Up to 30 September 2016, only three studies comprising 138 children met the criteria to be included in this review. All three studies included only children with viral encephalitis. One study of Japanese encephalitis, a specific form of viral encephalitis, analysed both effectiveness and safety, and concluded that IVIG treatment had no additional beneficial effects when compared with placebo (pretend) treatment. The other two studies analysed other measurements, such as length of hospital stay, time to resolution of spasms, symptoms arising due to nerve damage, and time to regain consciousness and concluded that adding IVIG treatment was more effective than standard care alone when these outcomes were considered. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of children and studies. The quality of evidence in the included studies was very low, making it impossible to draw any firm and definite conclusions on the clinical efficacy and safety of IVIG treatment for children with encephalitis.
Furthermore, there was no information on funding while, for one study, the main authors' group was affiliated to the funding body: this is a well-known potential source of conflict of interest and thus of bias.
Authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 19 August 2013. It includes 30 studies published from 1990 to 2012 in which 14,835 participants were randomised to receive a triclosan/copolymer containing fluoride toothpaste or a fluoride toothpaste that did not include triclosan/copolymer. The toothpaste that was used in most of the studies is sold by the manufacturer Colgate. The evidence produced shows benefits in using a triclosan/copolymer fluoride toothpaste when compared with a fluoride toothpaste (without triclosan/copolymer). There was a 22% reduction in plaque, a 22% reduction in gingivitis, a 48% reduction in bleeding gums and a 5% reduction in tooth decay. There was insufficient evidence to show a difference between either toothpaste in preventing periodontitis. There was no evidence of any harmful effects associated with the use of triclosan/copolymer toothpastes in studies up to three years in length. The evidence relating to plaque and gingivitis was considered to be of moderate quality. The evidence on tooth decay was high quality, while the evidence on periodontitis was low quality.
Adverse events were generally mild and did not differ from placebo in these singe dose studies. There were insufficient data to assess duration of action, but it is likely to be similar to ibuprofen 200 mg.
The review of trials found that a letter of invitation, mailed educational material, a phone call and some combined actions (such as a letter of invitation plus a phone call and training activities plus reminders) all seem to increase numbers of women participating. However it is not known which of these work better. Other interventions (such as a home visit) have not been proven to work.
We wanted to know if preventive CPAP and very early CPAP are effective in preventing RDS in premature babies. We were interested in:
- how many babies had BPD;
- whether CPAP successfully supported babies’ breathing, or if they needed to be put on a ventilator;
- how many babies died; and
- the combined number of babies who died or developed BPD. We searched for studies that investigated CPAP given to premature babies 15 minutes after birth, whether or not they showed signs of RDS, and to premature babies who showed early signs of RDS up to 1 hour after birth. Studies could look at:
- CPAP compared to supportive care, which includes supplemental oxygen;
- CPAP compared to putting babies on a ventilator; and
- preventive CPAP compared to very early CPAP. We found 8 studies with 3201 babies in total ranging from 24 to 32 weeks gestation:
- 4 studies with 765 babies compared CPAP with supportive care;
- 3 studies with 2364 babies compared CPAP with ventilation; and
- 1 study with 72 babies compared preventive CPAP with very early CPAP.
Studies took place in high- and middle-income countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Italy, New Zealand, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and the USA. Babies were very or extremely preterm, or very low birth weight (less than 1500 grams); no studies included late preterm babies or low birthweight babies. Compared to supportive care, CPAP:
- makes little to no difference to BPD up to 28 days after birth;
- may result in fewer babies needing to be put on a ventilator; and
- probably makes little to no difference to combined numbers of deaths and BPD.
Compared to a ventilator, CPAP:
- probably reduces BPD up to 36 weeks after birth;
- probably reduces the need for babies to be put on a ventilator by almost half; and
reduces the combined numbers of deaths and BPD.
Due to insufficient evidence, we don't know whether preventive CPAP compared to very early CPAP makes any difference to BPD up to 28 days after birth, reduces or increases the number of deaths up to 28 days after birth, or reduces the need for babies to be put on a ventilator. We have limited evidence about CPAP compared to supportive care. CPAP compared to ventilators probably reduces BPD and combined numbers of death and BPD. We are very uncertain about the effect of preventive CPAP compared with very early CPAP because there was one small study that lacked the details we needed. This updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to 6 November 2020.
We found 7 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing diet, physical activity, and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments (interventions) to a variety of control groups (who did not receive treatment) delivered to 923 overweight or obese preschool children up to the age of 6 years. We grouped the studies by the type of intervention. Our systematic review reported on the effects of multicomponent interventions and dietary interventions compared with no intervention, 'usual care', enhanced usual care, or some other therapy if it was also delivered in the intervention arm. The children in the included studies were monitored (called follow-up) for between six months and three years. Most studies reported the body mass index (BMI) z score: BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m²). In children, BMI is often measured in a way that takes into account sex, weight, and height as children grow older (BMI z score). We summarised the results of 4 trials in 202 children reporting the BMI z score, which on average was 0.4 units lower in the multicomponent intervention groups compared with the control groups. Lower units indicate more weight loss. For example, a 5-year-old girl with a body height of 110 cm and a body weight of 32 kg has a BMI of 26.4 and a BMI z score of 2.99. If this girl loses 2 kg weight within a year (and gained 1 cm in height), she would have reduced her BMI z score by approx. 0.4 units (her BMI would be 24.3 and her BMI z score 2.58). Accordingly, the average change in weight in the multicomponent interventions was 2.8 kg lower than in the control groups. Other effects of the interventions, such as improvements in health-related quality of life or evaluation of the parent-child relationship, were less clear, and most studies did not measure adverse events. No study investigated death from any cause, morbidity, or socioeconomic effects. One study found that BMI z score reduction was greater at the end of both dairy-rich and energy-restricted dietary interventions compared with a healthy lifestyle education only. However, only the dairy-rich diet continued to show benefits two to three years later, whereas the energy-restricted diet group had a greater increase in BMI z score than the control group.
This evidence is up to date as of March 2015. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because there were just a few studies per outcome measurement or the number of the included children was small. In addition, many children left the studies before they had finished.
We included research up to 21 February 2018. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi-RCTs, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series studies were all eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if they measured distress, confidence, feelings of coping, quality of life, how families functioned, feelings of support, or confidence in dealing with services among parents or any other family carers. Children being cared for could have any condition (for example, chronic or severe acute illness, disability, any kind of delayed or atypical development).
Results
We found 22 studies of 2404 participants who were caring for children with a wide range of conditions. All studies were RCTs or quasi-RCTs and compared peer support to usual care (comparison 1) or to another intervention (comparison 2). Peer support was delivered in hospitals and in the community. Although we found studies that evaluated effects of peer support on all outcomes in comparison 1, and several outcomes in comparison 2, we did not see any benefit from peer support compared to usual care or compared to another intervention. We found no studies that reported on adverse effects (such as stress from hearing others' stories or conflicts with group members). Feedback from parents and carers suggests that they value emotional support, validation of their experiences, and access to knowledge that they find in peer support groups. More information is needed about training and supervision of peer support leaders, and about whether many participants withdraw from groups (and if so, why).
The overall quality of evidence for each outcome was low to very low, and because of this, our certainty about these findings is low. This means that further research is likely to change these findings while making clearer the possible benefits or harms of peer support interventions.
Conclusion
At the moment, we are uncertain about whether peer support helps or harms parents and carers of children with complex needs.
We included 17 studies evaluating systemic corticosteroid therapy (given intravenously or by tablets) for people with pneumonia (2264 participants; 1954 adults and 310 children). We included 12 new studies in this update and excluded one previously included study. All included studies evaluated people who had acquired pneumonia in the community (community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)) being treated in the hospital; no studies assessed people who had developed pneumonia while in hospital or who were on breathing machines (mechanically ventilated). Eight trials did not report funding sources; seven were funded by academic sponsors; one was funded by a pharmaceutical company; and one reported receiving no funding. Corticosteroids reduced deaths in adults with severe CAP, but not in people with non-severe CAP. Eighteen adults with severe CAP need to be treated with corticosteroids to prevent one death.
People with CAP treated with corticosteroids had lower clinical failure rates (death, worsening of imaging studies, or no clinical improvement), shorter time to cure, a shorter hospital stay, and fewer complications. We found good-quality evidence that corticosteroids reduced clinical failure rates in children with pneumonia, but the data were based on a small number of children with different types of pneumonia.
People treated with corticosteroids had higher blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) than those not treated with corticosteroids. Corticosteroid treatment was not associated with increased rates of other serious adverse events.
Corticosteroids were beneficial for adults with severe CAP. People with non-severe CAP may also benefit from corticosteroid therapy, but with no survival advantage. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to issues with study design, unclear results, or results that were not similar across studies. For the outcomes of death and clinical failure in adults, we graded the quality of the evidence as moderate. For the outcomes of clinical failure in people with severe CAP, non-severe CAP, and in children, we graded the quality of the evidence as high.
This review is based on five randomised trials; four comparing methotrexate with placebo, and one comparing methotrexate with colchicine. Methotrexate, compared with placebo, has no significant beneficial effect on mortality and the need for liver transplantation is not significantly reduced. The effects of methotrexate on pruritus, fatigue, clinical complications, liver biochemistry levels, liver histology, and adverse events were not significantly different from placebo. There may be some beneficial effect on pruritus score (ie, an objective measure of subjective feeling of pruritus), but we cannot recommend methotrexate for this indication only, taken into account possible adverse events. In the small trial comparing methotrexate versus colchicine, methotrexate seemed to work superior to colchicine, but it is not clear if this stems from the fact that methotrexate exerts beneficial effects as colchicine exerts harmful effects. In comparison with both placebo and colchicine, methotrexate was associated with large risks of mortality and adverse events, but the increase did not reach statistical significance.
We wanted to compare the benefits and risks of rituximab against those of other treatments for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. We searched for studies that compared rituximab against placebo (dummy) treatment or steroid treatment for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes of participant groups. We found two studies, conducted in Italy and the USA, involving a total of 56 people with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. Everyone taking part in the study was aged 18 to 80 years (average age 55 years) and 77% were women. One study (31 people) compared intravenous rituximab (2 x 1000 mg infusions given 2 weeks apart or a single infusion of 500 mg) to intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid). The other study (25 people) compared intravenous rituximab (2 x 1000 mg infusions given 2 weeks apart) to intravenous placebo (dummy) infusions. As the studies compared rituximab to different alternative treatments, it was not possible to combine the studies' results to analyse them together. The evidence suggests that rituximab, compared to intravenous methylprednisolone, may result in an improvement in how 'active' the thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy is at 24 weeks following treatment when measured using one particular scale, but the evidence for whether there was a true difference was uncertain. Furthermore, there was little to no difference when thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy activity was measured using a different scale. There was no evidence of a difference in the following outcomes, measured at 24 weeks following treatment:
- reduction in eye protrusion
- reduction in how wide open the eyelids are
- improvement in eye movement and double vision
- improvement in quality of life
The evidence suggests that rituximab, compared to placebo, results in little to no difference in any of the outcomes outlined above, measured at 24 weeks following treatment.
The number of adverse events was higher for rituximab compared to both intravenous methylprednisolone and placebo, but the evidence for whether there was a true difference was uncertain. The evidence is only based on two studies with few participants, and both of these studies were stopped earlier than originally planned, which limits our confidence in the findings. The evidence is current to February 2022.
The review of trials found that people with asthma taking gold need careful monitoring as there are harmful effects, and it may only have a very small impact on asthma symptoms.
We do not know what is the best antibiotic treatment for a person who has an MRSA SSI. We aimed to resolve this uncertainty by performing a thorough search of the medical literature for studies that compared different antibiotic treatments for MRSA SSIs. We included only randomised controlled trials, as, if conducted properly, these provide the best information. We did not limit our search for trials according to language or year of publication. Two review authors independently identified the trials and extracted information.
We identified only one trial that compared different antibiotic treatments for MRSA SSIs. This trial had 59 participants who were hospitalised because of their MRSA SSIs. Thirty participants in this trial received an antibiotic called linezolid, which can be taken in tablet form or given as injections through the vein (intravenously). The remaining participants received another antibiotic called vancomycin, which can be only given intravenously. The type(s) of surgical procedures that the participants had were not specified. MRSA was eradicated in more people who received linezolid than vancomycin. It would be helpful if this finding were confirmed by other studies. This trial did not report on other features of eradicating MRSA with these antibiotics, such as:
1. whether the wound healed quickly;
2. length of hospital stay;
3. quality of life, and
4. whether the benefits of treatment outweighed any unwanted side-effects of the medicine.
Overall, the quality of available evidence was poor. Currently, we cannot recommend any particular antibiotic for treating MRSA SSIs. Linezolid appears to be better than vancomycin for eradication of MRSA SSIs according to low-quality evidence from this one small trial, but the wider implications of this treatment are not known. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary to identify the best antibiotic treatment for MRSA SSIs.
The review assessed whether routine antibiotic treatment after uncomplicated vaginal birth, compared with either placebo or no antibiotics, prevents maternal infection. We searched for evidence in August 2017 in three databases. We identified three trials involving 1779 women. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low. Different antibiotics were administered in the three trials and for different lengths of time. The trials took place in the 1960s (one trial) and 1990s (two trials), and were carried out in France, the USA and Brazil.
Routine antibiotic administration reduced the number of women with infection of the lining of the uterus (endometritis) (2 trials, 1364 women) by 70%. The use of antibiotics did not reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections (2 trials, 1706 women), wound infections after episiotomy (2 trials, 1364 women) or length of maternal hospital stay (1 trial, 1291 women).
There were no differences between the groups for skin rash due to antibiotics, reported in one woman in each of the two trials (1706 women). The cost of care was higher in the group that did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence of severe maternal infections and illness, antimicrobial resistance or women's satisfaction with care were not addressed. The small number of trials limits the interpretation of the evidence for routine use of antibiotics after normal vaginal births. The low incidence of endometritis in the studies suggests that a relatively large number of women may have to be treated to avoid a few case of infection.
There needs to be a balance between women's needs, childbirth setting and provider experience (for example, with frequent vaginal examinations or interventions) and the public health threat of antibiotics resistance.
Further research from well-designed randomised controlled trials would help to evaluate the added value of routinely giving women antibiotics after normal vaginal birth to prevent maternal infections.
We included four trials that had a limited number of patients (388) and assessed four different interventions: human activated protein C, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, tranexamic acid and dermatan sulphate with heparin or placebo. Two trials included patients either with or without leukemia. The other two trials only included patients with leukemia. The studies were published between 1989 and 2007, and were conducted in Japan, Italy and the Netherlands. All trials have a high risk of bias. There were no deaths reported in a trial comparing dermatan sulphate with heparin. Two small trials which included patients with leukemia only (22 participants) reported bleeding data. These results were not compiled due to inconsistency in the measurement and reporting of that outcome. One trial found very low quality evidence that tranexamic acid compared with placebo reduces bleeding in leukemia patients. On the contrary, there is no evidence that dermatan sulphate compared with placebo reduces new events of hemorrhagic diathesis in patients with leukemia. Saftey profile is inconclusive. No thromboembolic complications were reported in both the trials.
These trials did not report overall mortality, resolution of respiratory failure, renal failure and shock.
Accordingly, the clinical benefits and harms of the human activated protein C, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, tranexamic acid and dermatan sulphate are unknown in this population. The confidence in the results of this review is very low. The studies have limitations in the way they were designed and executed. Moreover, the limited number of patients included in the studies led to imprecise results. Well conducted larger studies will provide more information about the effect of human activated protein C, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, tranexamic acid and dermatan sulphate for treating DIC in patients with acute or chronic leukemia.

This summary of an update of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of herbal therapies consumed orally by people with osteoarthritis. After searching for all relevant studies to August 2013, we included 45 new studies since the last review, giving a total of 49 studies (on 33 herbal interventions) that included 5980 participants, most with mild to moderate symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. Thirty-three different medicinal plant products were compared with placebo or active intervention controls and many comparisons had single studies only; thus, we have restricted reporting of results here to multiple studies of Boswellia serrata (monoherbal) and avocado-soyabean unsaponifiables (ASU) (two herb combination) products.  Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores mean reduced pain):
- people who used 100 mg of enriched Boswellia serrata extract rated their pain 17 points lower (range 8 to 26 points lower) (17% absolute improvement) at 90 days compared with placebo;
- people who used enriched Boswellia serrata extract 100 mg rated their pain as 23 points;
- people who used a placebo preparation rated their pain as 40 points.
Physical function on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores means better physical function):
- people who used 100 mg of enriched Boswellia serrata extract rated their physical function 8 points better (2 to 14 points better) on a 100 point scale (8% absolute improvement) at 90 days compared with placebo;
- people who used 100 mg of enriched Boswellia serrata extract rated their physical function as 25 points;
- people who used placebo rated their physical function as 33 points. Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores mean less pain):
- people who used ASU 300 mg rated their pain 8 points lower (1 to 16 points lower) on a 100 point scale (8% absolute improvement) at 3 to 12 months compared with placebo;
- people who used ASU 300 mg rated their pain as 33 points;
- people who used placebo rated their pain as 41 points.
Physical function on a scale of 0 to 100 mm scale (lower scores means better physical function):
- people who used ASU 300 mg rated their physical function 7 mm better (2 to 12 mm better) on a 100 mm scale (7% absolute improvement) at 3 to 12 months compared with placebo;
- people who used ASU 300 mg rated their physical function as 40 mm;
- people who used placebo rated their physical function as 47 mm. There is moderate-quality evidence that in people with osteoarthritis Boswellia serrata slightly improved pain and function. Further research may change the estimates.
There is moderate-quality evidence that avocado-soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) probably improved pain and function slightly, but may not preserve joint space. Further research may change the estimates.
We are uncertain whether other oral herbal products improve osteoarthritis pain or function, or slow progression of joint structure damage because the available evidence is limited to single studies or studies that cannot be pooled, and some of these studies are of low to very low quality. Quality of life was not measured.
Herbal therapies may cause side effects, however we are uncertain if there is an increased risk of these.
Some studies suggest that reading skills and musical abilities might be related and that musical training may be able to help in the development of language and literacy skills. As information about the effectiveness of musical learning for children and adolescents is lacking, we searched widely for high-quality evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials. We did not find any and so it is not possible for us to reliably assess the advantages (or even disadvantages) of music education for improving the reading skills of dyslexic children. Well-designed research with a large number of participants is required to evaluate potential benefits of musical education for children and adolescents with dyslexia.
Cryotherapy, usually using liquid nitrogen, is often used for the treatment of warts, but it is less convenient, more painful, and also more expensive. One study suggested that there is evidence that cryotherapy is better than SA for warts on the hands, but when we combined this study with our other results, we were unable to confirm this. We found that more aggressive cryotherapy appears to be more effective than gentle cryotherapy, but with an increased risk of adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring. We only looked at information from clinical trials of cryotherapy and not over-the-counter freezing treatments for warts, so we cannot say if these are as effective.
During the production of the last version of this review, duct tape had gained favour as it is a safe and simple treatment that is easy to apply; however, the trial on which this was based was relatively small. In this updated review, we found two further trials of duct tape that suggested that this treatment is not as effective as first thought.
Other treatments covered by this review include 5-fluorouracil, dinitrochlorobenzene, intralesional bleomycin, intralesional interferon, photodynamic therapy, and intralesional antigen. None of these treatments are used commonly, even by skin specialists, and there is much less evidence for their effectiveness. The limited available evidence we do have suggests that some of these treatments may be effective and could therefore be used for warts that have not responded to simpler, safer treatments, such as salicylic acid or cryotherapy.
Overall, providing a useful idea of 'what works' from such a wide range of studies was difficult as many studies were of poor quality.
We investigated whether these medicines reduce the number of HAE attacks, and if any attacks that do occur are less severe than they would otherwise be. We also looked at whether people taking the medicines experienced a better quality of life, and whether the medicines caused unwanted side effects. We searched medical databases for clinical studies in children or adults with HAE that compared medications to prevent HAE attacks with placebo (a pretend treatment) or another medicine. We found 15 studies with 912 participants. All medicines except avoralstat reduced the number of HAE attacks, and even when attacks did occur, they were less severe for C1-INH and lanadelumab (there were no results for the other medicines). We found that most medicines improved the quality of life of the people with HAE and were generally safe as they did not increase the number of serious and less serious side effects.
We found no studies that tested tranexamic acid, and only one study tested danazol. There were also no studies that compared one medicine directly with another. This means that we cannot say for sure whether one medicine is better than another. C1-INH, berotralstat, lanadelumab and danazol appear to reduce the risk of HAE attacks and increase the quality of life in people with HAE. The medicines do not seem to result in an increase in side effects. Our findings are limited by the small number of studies and the small number of participants in each study. Therefore, our confidence in these findings is low. The evidence is current to 3 August 2021.
This review of 15 studies showed magnesium sulphate reduced the number of women having eclampsia, but did not improve the babies' health. Magnesium sulphate had side effects for the mother, mostly flushing. Follow-up of women and children is reassuring that there are no adverse effects later on.
Nine studies including 808 premenopausal women with uterine fibroids compared various methods of myomectomy. These studies were conducted in Italy (seven studies), Austria and China. The evidence is current to July 2014. Myomectomy by laparoscopy is a less painful procedure compared with open surgery. Postoperative pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), with zero meaning 'no pain at all' and 10 signifying 'pain as bad as it could be.' Results show that among women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy, the mean pain score at six hours (mean difference (MD) -2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.88 to -1.92) and at 48 hours (MD -1.90, 95% CI -2.80 to -1.00) would be likely to range from about three points lower to one point lower on a VAS zero-to-10 scale. Results of our analysis regarding pain score at 24 hours were uncertain (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.12). Risk of fever after the operation was reduced by 50% in women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.77). Drop in haemoglobin level (indicating reduced blood loss) could not be compared because results of the analysis were not conclusive because of differences in results with even the same surgical techniques. Risk of injury to intestines and other organs could not be determined in this meta-analysis. No evidence was found of increased risk of recurrence of fibroids after laparoscopic surgery compared with open surgery (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.99). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Some outcomes involved small numbers of participants, poor information about blinding in included studies and very wide confidence intervals.
The only six studies identified focussed on maternal biochemical measures during or shortly after labour and could not be included in the review. The studies were conducted in the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Future trials should examine the use of different types of intravenous and oral fluids on clinically important outcomes and include women's perception and satisfaction with care during labour and birth.
Antibiotics are administered to pregnant women during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (before labour) to prevent bacteria in the vagina and cervix affecting the pregnancy. Infection by some infectious organisms in a woman’s genital tract can cause health problems for the mother and her baby, and has been associated with preterm births. This review of eight randomised trials involved approximately 4300 women in their second or third trimester. We found that antibiotics did not reduce the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (one trial, low quality of evidence ), or the risk of preterm birth (six trials, highquality of evidence ). Preterm delivery was reduced in pregnant women who had a previous preterm birth and an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis) during the current pregnancy. There was no reduction in preterm delivery in pregnant women with previous preterm birth without a bacterial imbalance during the current pregnancy (two trials). Postpartum endometritis, or infection of the uterus following birth, was reduced overall (three trials, moderate quality of evidence ), as well as in a trial of high-risk women who had a previous preterm birth (one trial, moderate quality of evidence). No reduction in neonatal illness was observed. Outcomes of interest were available in trials with high losses to follow-up. We could not estimate the side effects of antibiotics since side effects were rare; however, antibiotics may still have serious side effects on women and their babies.
There is, therefore, no justification to give antibiotics to all pregnant women during the second or third trimester to prevent adverse infectious effects on pregnancy outcomes.
We included three randomised controlled studies with a total of 128 participants in this review. The duration of zinc supplementation ranged between four and 12 weeks. No study reported on our patient-important key outcomes (new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, side effects, health-related quality of life, all-cause mortality, diabetic complications, socioeconomic effects). The effects of zinc supplementation are uncertain regarding insulin resistance and lipid levels in the blood (mainly cholesterol and triglycerides). The overall quality of the included studies was unclear because study authors did not provide important information for us to judge how the studies were performed (unclear risk of bias in most cases). In addition, the number of studies and participants is low and the study authors did not investigate important outcomes such as new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus or side effects of zinc supplementation. This evidence is up to date as of March 2015.
We wanted to find out if magnesium sulphate is better than placebo (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but appears identical to the medicine being tested) at protecting the brains of babies likely to be born preterm.
We were interested in the effect of magnesium sulphate on important outcomes, including: death (of the babies, or later as children), cerebral palsy, and major 'neurodevelopmental disability' (which might include serious outcomes like cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness, or global cognitive or intellectual impairment). We were also interested in the effect on important outcomes for women, including serious complications of magnesium sulphate (death, respiratory or cardiac arrest), and stopping treatment because of side effects. We searched for studies that looked at whether magnesium sulphate caused benefits or harms for women and their preterm babies when compared to placebo or no treatment. We compared and summarised results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found six studies involving 5917 women at less than 34 weeks of pregnancy and their 6759 babies. The studies were all conducted in high-income countries. The included studies compared magnesium sulphate with placebo. Compared with placebo, magnesium sulphate in women at risk of having their babies preterm:
• reduces cerebral palsy (evidence from 6 studies with 6107 children) and the combined outcome of death or cerebral palsy (6 studies, 6481 children) for children up to two years of age;
• probably makes little to no difference in death (6 studies, 6759 children), major neurodevelopmental disability (1 study, 987 children), or the combined outcome of death or major neurodevelopmental disability (3 studies, 4279 children), for children up to two years of age;
• may make little to no difference in the above-mentioned outcomes for children at early school age;
• may make little to no difference in serious complications of treatment for women (4 studies, 5300 women), but probably increases women stopping treatment because of side effects (3 studies, 4736 women). We are confident in our finding that magnesium sulphate reduces cerebral palsy, and the combined outcome of death or cerebral palsy, in children up to two years of age.
We have little confidence in the evidence for outcomes of children at school age, as studies could not provide data for all children, and there are not yet enough studies/data to be certain about the results.
We have little confidence in our finding that magnesium sulphate makes little to no difference in serious complications of treatment for women, as there was only one complication reported in one study. We have moderate confidence in our findings that magnesium sulphate probably increases women stopping treatment because of side effects, as the findings differed across studies, probably because of different decision-making processes for stopping treatment.
The results of further research for the outcomes in which we have limited confidence could differ from the results of this review. The evidence is current to 17 March 2023.
We wanted to find out if TENS can relieve period pain without causing unwanted effects. We were interested only in the effects of TENS on women whose pain was caused by periods, not due to any other condition. We wanted to know if high-frequency TENS was more effective than low-frequency TENS, and whether TENS was more effective than a placebo (dummy) treatment or no treatment, or other treatments for period pain. We searched for studies that investigated high- or low-frequency TENS compared with a placebo or no treatment, or another treatment. Studies could take place anywhere in the world as long as they included women and girls with period pain. For this review, we included 20 studies with 585 women with period pain. Studies were published between 1985 and 2019. They mostly took place in Brazil, the USA and Sweden, with others in South Korea, Japan, Iran, Norway, Turkey, Taiwan and India. may reduce pain (10 studies, 345 women) but we don't know if there is any difference in unwanted effects (3 studies, 146 women).• Low-frequency TENS compared with placebo or no treatmentmay also reduce pain (3 studies, 645 women). No studies reported unwanted effects.• High-frequency TENS compared with low-frequency TENS:we don't know which has more effect on pain (3 studies, 54 women). One study reported that no unwanted effects occurred.• High-frequency TENS compared with other treatments:the only other treatments we found were acupressure (1 study, 18 women), acetaminophen (paracetamol)(1 study, 20 women), and 'interferential current therapy', which is similar to TENS but with a stronger electrical current (2 studies, 62 women). We don't know if there was any difference between high-frequency TENS and these treatments. There may be no difference in unwanted effects.• Low-frequency TENS compared with other treatments: the only other treatment we found was acetaminophen (1 study, 20 women). We don't know if there was any difference between the two treatments. No studies reported unwanted effects. Overall, our confidence in the evidence was low to very low. This was mainly because we found a small number of studies, and they did not include many women. In particular, unwanted effects were poorly reported in most studies. This new review replaces a review published in 2009. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.
Ten studies (994 participants) provided information for the review. These ten studies compared outpatient antibiotic therapy (491 participants) versus inpatient therapy (503 participants) in people with cancer who developed febrile neutropaenia. Six studies were conducted in adults (628 participants) and four studies were in children (366 participants). These ten trials compared effectiveness in terms of the disappearance of signs of infection (mainly fever) and nine studies assessed the effect on mortality (death). Eight studies recorded the number of treatment days for the fever to resolve. Five studies compared the duration of neutropaenia between out- and inpatients. Five studies analysed duration of antibiotics usage and six looked at the duration of hospitalisation.Two studies assessed quality of life for patients.
In eight of the 10 studies, outpatient antibiotic therapy was part of an early discharge programme, i.e. antibiotics were given for a few days in the hospital and then the participants was discharged home. In the other two studies, the antibiotics were started at home. Outpatient antibiotic therapy is probably as effective as inpatient therapy in people (both in adults and children) with cancer who develop febrile neutropaenia for improving the signs of infection, including reducing fever. There was probably little or no difference in mortality between the outpatient therapy and inpatient therapy, as well as in the duration of treatment with antibiotics, or frequency of adverse events related to the use of antibiotics. Treatment as an outpatient may reduce the number of days patients need to be treated in hospital. In general, the studies were of moderate certainty.
We included two randomised controlled trials of moderate quality, including 260 children with measles, comparing children given vitamin A with children not given vitamin A. The evidence is current to December 2015. Two doses of vitamin A given on two consecutive days to hospitalised children with measles led to an increase in the blood concentration of vitamin A after one week. However, there is a limitation in that neither of the two included studies reported blindness or other eye problems in children infected with measles. Also, no side effects of the treatment were reported in the included studies. We do not have sufficient evidence to demonstrate the benefit or otherwise of vitamin A in the prevention of blindness in children infected with measles. The quality of the evidence and methodology of both studies was moderate. The sample size of the included studies was relatively small, which could affect the accuracy of the results.
We included 25 studies of which 4 studies are awaiting assessment. The 21 studies that could be analysed included a total of 3479 employees. Sixteen studies trained supervisor-employee interaction, either off-the-job (9 studies) or on-the job (7 studies). Five studies trained the design of working environments, off-the-job in 2 studies and on-the job in 3 studies. The 21 studies compared 23 interventions with no training, sham training or other training at various times of follow-up. There is no considerable effect of supervisor training on employees' stress (6 studies) or absenteeism (1 study) when compared to no training. There is inconsistent evidence that supervisor training may (2 studies) or may not (7 studies) improve employees' well-being when compared to no training. Data were missing from two studies, so we could not calculate the effects of training on employee well-being.
There is no effect of supervisor training on employees' stress (2 studies) or absenteeism (1 study) when compared to a placebo training. Data were missing from one study, so we could not calculate the effects of training on employee well-being.
One study that evaluated supervisor training compared to another type of training to reduce employees' stress did not provide enough data to calculate its effects. The quality of the evidence was very low for most outcomes due to risk of bias in the studies, inconsistent results, and imprecise effects. Researchers should consider the shortcomings of studies included in this review in order to conduct well-designed studies in the future and report them appropriately. Overall, the data suggest that training of supervisors may not lead to reduced levels of stress and absenteeism, or improved levels of well-being in their employees. The discrepancy between the apparent scientific consensus and the empirical evidence might be attributed to weak study designs.High quality studies are needed to clarify if supervisor training affects employees' stress, absenteeism, and well-being.
We found one well-performed study that enrolled 127 infants addressing this question. Evidence is up to date as of 20 September 2018. The use of nutrients made from human milk, when compared with nutrients made from cow's milk, did not reduce the risk of intestinal disease (necrotizing enterocolitis), feeding problems, death, infections, or improve growth in preterm infants fed with breast milk. Nutrients made from human milk (multi-nutrient fortifier), when compared with nutrients made from cow's milk, may not change the occurrence of illnesses or improve the growth in preterm infants fed only with breast milk. This evidence is insufficient to conclude whether nutrient made from human milk (multi-nutrient fortifier) when provided to preterm infants fed only with breast milk is beneficial or not. More studies are needed to address this important question.
The effect appeared to be greater in trials including a high proportion of patients with early stage disease. Combined chemotherapy/radiotherapy also delayed tumour recurrence and reduced the risk of re-growth near the original cancer site as well as in other parts of the body. There was an increase in side-effects, principally affecting the blood and bowel, but these generally only lasted a short time. Long-term effects were poorly reported.
This review aimed to explore this question and included three studies with a total of 466 participants. These studies did not find any overall difference between asthma clinic and usual clinical practice care by a general practitioner for the following outcomes: A&E department visits for asthma, use of reliever or preventer medication for asthma and quality of life measures, but there was considerable uncertainty about these results. One study found that there was a reduction in nocturnal awakening due to asthma in the asthma clinic group compared to control but no difference in other symptom outcomes reported. Given the limited evidence found in this review, we believe that there is a need for further evidence in order to assess the effectiveness of asthma clinics.
We wanted to find out the best ways of restoring shoulder function and avoiding harmful effects of treatment in adults with shoulder fractures. We searched medical databases for studies looking at the management of shoulder fractures in adults. We then summarised the results for different comparisons and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study quality and size. We found 47 studies that involved 3179 adults with a shoulder fracture. The studies were conducted in 21 countries. Most studies followed people for at least one year. Most people were aged 60 years and above; over two-thirds were women. Twelve studies evaluated non-surgical treatment; 10 studies compared surgical with non-surgical treatment; 23 compared two methods of surgery; and 2 studies tested timing of mobilisation after surgery. Here we focus on three key questions. Due to limited evidence from five non-surgical studies, we are unsure whether early movement of the arm improves or makes no difference to long-term shoulder function or the development of shoulder problems. Ten studies tested whether surgery for adults with most types of displaced fractures gave a better result than non-surgical treatment. There was strong evidence of no important differences between surgical and non-surgical treatment in patient-reported shoulder function at 1 and 2 years, and probably at 6 months too. There is strong evidence of no important difference between the two treatments in quality of life at 1 year. Thirty-one people in the studies died, but only 1 death was linked with surgery. Surgery may result in a higher risk of needing additional surgery and a higher risk of complications. There is, however, also a small possibility of more shoulder problems after non-surgical treatment. We selected two key comparisons.
- Four studies compared a plate with a nail for surgical fixation after the bone has been put back together. The choice of surgery may make no difference to shoulder function. The very limited evidence means we are unsure if the choice of surgery affects quality of life, harmful effects or need for additional surgery.
- Two studies comparing an RTSA with hemiarthroplasty found shoulder function was improved to a similar extent, but that additional surgery was less frequent after RTSA. However, there is not enough evidence overall to tell whether one type of replacement is better than the other. We are confident of the findings of no difference in function or quality of life between surgery and non-surgical treatment for most types of displaced fractures. Otherwise, we are unsure of other findings, usually because there was not enough evidence. This review updates our previous review published in 2015. The evidence is up to date to September 2020.
We have included 42 trials of acupuncture and acupressure compared to a control (sham/placebo, medication, Chinese herbs, no treatment or usual care) in a total of 4640 women of reproductive age with period pain. Twenty-two studies were undertaken in China. Eight studies were undertaken in Iran, four studies in Taiwan, two studies in Korea, and one each in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA.The evidence is current to September 2015. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether or not acupuncture or acupressure is effective in treating primary dysmenorrhoea, and for most comparisons no information was available on adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons. The main limitations were risk of bias, poor reporting, inconsistency and risk of publication bias.
All participants in these RCTs received a drug aimed at suppressing the immune response (cyclosporine or tacrolimus). The study by Perkins and coworkers was funded by public and industry sources. The study by Kiehl and coworkers was funded by public sources. The funding source for the study by Bolwell and coworkers was not specified. Our results show no clinically meaningful difference between mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate on length of survival, incidence of GVHD, disease relapse, or treatment-related death. People treated with mycophenolate mofetil had a shorter time to make new platelets (cells that help the blood to clot) from the donor cells compared with people treated with methotrexate. In addition, in terms of side effects, people treated with mycophenolate mofetil were less likely to have severe mucositis (inflammation of the mucus membranes), require parenteral nutrition (feeding through a vein), or pain medication.
None of the included studies reported any data related to quality of life.
In summary, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate both remain acceptable medications for the prevention of GVHD; however, mycophenolate mofetil seems to be associated with a smaller incidence of harms such as severe mucositis and related supportive care. The overall quality of evidence was low.
The three trials identified found no good evidence that cleansing pressure ulcers (bed sores) using a particular technique, or cleansing with a particular solution, helps healing. Very little research has studied the cleansing of pressure ulcers and therefore we are unable to draw any firm conclusions.
Anticoagulants are beneficial and safe for preventing a second stroke in people with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and recent cerebral ischaemia. Nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF) is a heart rhythm disorder commonly found in patients who have had a stroke. Patients with NRAF have an irregular heart beat and this can cause the formation of a blood clot in the left atrium of the heart . This clot may break away and block a cerebral artery causing a stroke. Patients who have had a stroke in the presence of NRAF have a high risk of another stroke. Anticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin, make the blood 'thinner' and prevent the formation of blood clots and hence could prevent stroke. However, anticoagulant drugs may also cause bleeding in the brain and this complication could offset any benefits. This review identified two trials in which patients with NRAF who had a stroke were treated with anticoagulant therapy. These studies show that anticoagulants safely reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by two-thirds, despite a higher chance of major extracranial bleeds. There was no increased risk of intracranial bleeds.
This review found forty-three studies which evaluated non-traditional roles of pharmacists. In general, the data included in this review supported the roles of pharmacists in patient counseling, therapeutic management, and providing health professional education with the goal of improving patient process of care and clinical outcomes. Non-traditional roles of outpatient pharmacists improves health care outcomes. The data show that educational outreach visits may impact physician prescribing patterns.
We wanted to find out how effective strategies were in supporting the implementation of school-based interventions to address diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use in students (aged 5 to 18 years). For example, whether education and training of school canteen operators (implementation strategy) can improve the implementation of a healthy canteen policy (intervention) to reduce availability of unhealthy food (implementation outcome) and improve student diet. We also wanted to know if they had any adverse effects and if they were cost-effective. Other examples of strategies include methods of improving quality, feedback on how the school was doing, prompts and reminders, and educational resources (e.g. manuals). We updated a previous search that we had conducted for trials that compared the use of a strategy to support intervention implementation to those that had not, or that had compared two or more different implementation strategies. The trials looked at strategies to support the implementation of interventions in schools that addressed student diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as trial methods and sizes. We found 14 new trials to add to those identified in our previous search, bringing the total number of included trials to 39 with 6489 participants. Most were conducted in Australia and the USA and most examined strategies to implement healthy eating and/or physical activity interventions. We found, compared with a control, that the use of implementation strategies probably results in large improvements in the implementation of healthy eating, diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use interventions in schools. An increasing number of trials assessed potential adverse effects for schools, staff or students and none identified any adverse effects. A number of trials assessed the economic benefits of the use of intervention implementation support strategies; however, the results were inconclusive. Despite our review showing that the use of implementation strategies probably results in large improvements in programme implementation, the trials used methods likely to introduce errors in their results and were primarily conducted in two countries (Australia and USA). As a result, we are moderately confident that strategies to support implementation improve the implementation of these interventions in schools. We searched databases between 1 May 2021 and 30 June 2023.
We searched important medical databases for clinical trials assessing the benefits and harms of nivolumab in adults with HL. Two review authors independently screened, summarised and analysed the results. In addition, we tested the computer software RobotReviewer to extract data. Our search led to the inclusion of three studies involving 283 participants and 14 ongoing trials.
The evidence provided is current to May 2018. Two studies with 260 participants evaluated survival. After six months, all participants were alive in one trial (17 participants). One trial reported quality of life for a subgroup of participants using a questionnaire but not all follow-up data were available. Although it seemed that the participants answering the questionnaire might have had a benefit, it was unclear whether this applied to all the participants. The studies also reported tumour control and tumour response, but with different results, depending on the treatment and how many previous treatments participants had received before nivolumab was given.
As nivolumab is given until the disease progresses (gets worse) or until unacceptable side effects occur, people receive the drug for a long time. Therefore, reporting of side effects is related to the time the person received the medicine, with potentially more side effects with longer usage. The most commonly reported side effects were fatigue (tiredness), diarrhoea (loose stools), infusion reactions (during or shortly after giving the medicine by a vein) and rash. Only one study reported medicine-related serious side effects. They occurred rarely (infusion reactions and lung disease). Deaths related to the medicine were not reported. Due to the study design and varied type of participants with different numbers of previous treatments and various treatment options, the reliability of the evidence was low to very low. This systematic review evaluated the benefits and harms of nivolumab in adults with HL.
Data on survival, quality of life, tumour response and side effects were available from small trials only. The three trials included only people different previous treatment options, very often also with a previous stem cell transplantation. In one trial, all participants were alive after six months. Quality of life data were not reported for all the included participants; moreover, data after a long period of treatment were not available for all evaluated participants, therefore meaningful conclusions were not possible. Serious side effects occurred rarely. Currently, data are too sparse to make a clear statement on nivolumab for people with relapsed or refractory HL except for those who had received several treatments before. As there are currently 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are well designed, it is possible that an update of this review will be published in the near future and that this update will show different results to those reported here.
We searched for clinical trials assessing the effect of delayed (more than four days after birth) versus earlier introduction of milk feeds (where human milk or formula is fed directly by a tube into the stomach) on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, death and general health in very preterm or VLBW infants. The search is up-to-date as of October 2021. We found 14 trials with 1551 infants participating. About half of these infants had evidence of compromised growth while in the womb. Combined analysis of these trials showed that delayed introduction of progressive enteral feeds may not reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis or death. Delayed feeding may slightly reduce the risk of feed intolerance, but probably increases the risk of serious infection occurring. This review provides low-certainty evidence that delaying the introduction of enteral feeds may not reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis or death for very preterm or VLBW infants, including infants whose growth in the womb was compromised.
The evidence is current to April 2014. We found three studies (from four reports) involving a total of 22 children aged three to nine years who received a combination of NSOMTs and articulation or phonological therapy (intervention group), or articulation or phonological therapy alone (control group). One study was a randomised controlled trial in which four boys with speech sound disorders were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. In this study, each participant received 16 × 30-minute individual therapy sessions, twice per week over eight weeks, to treat the speech sound 's'. For the intervention group, NSOMT (oral placement therapy) was conducted in the first 10 minutes of each session, followed by 20-minute articulation therapy. The other two studies used randomisation, but the method used to generate the random sequence was not reported. In one of these studies, six boys and four girls, all with speech sound disorders due to tongue thrust, were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Each participant received 22 × 30-minute individual sessions conducted weekly in the first six weeks, and twice a week in the following eight weeks, to treat 's' and 'z' sounds. The intervention group received NSOMT (Hanson's 1977 approach) in the first six weeks and alternating sessions of NSOMT and articulation therapy in the following eight weeks. The final study randomly assigned four boys and four girls with moderate to severe articulation disorder alone to either intervention group or control group. Each participant received 9 × 20-minute group therapy sessions (two participants in each group), conducted twice a week over five weeks. For the intervention group, NSOMT (oral motor exercises for speech clarity) was conducted during the first 10 minutes of each session. Speech errors associated with the 's' sound were treated for the intervention group; however, the speech sound(s) treated for the control group were not detailed. None of the studies reported funding support. Two studies (one that used oral placement therapy and one that used Hanson's 1977 approach) did not find NSOMT as an adjunctive treatment to be more effective than conventional speech intervention only, as both intervention and control groups had made similar improvements in articulation after treatment (i.e. fewer speech errors or increased percentage of correct articulation). The study that used oral motor exercises for speech clarity as the NSOMT reported a change in articulation test results after treatment, but used an inappropriate statistical test and did not report the results clearly. The three included studies were small in scale and had a number of serious methodological limitations. Moreover, these studies covered limited types of NSOMTs for treating just one class of speech sounds - 's' with or without 'z' - in children with speech sound disorders. Hence, the overall applicability of the evidence is limited, and the evidence is believed to be incomplete and of low quality. To conclude, currently no strong evidence indicates whether NSOMTs are effective as treatment or adjunctive treatment for children with developmental speech sound disorders.
There are studies that show that oral antibiotics are effective when children are treated as outpatients. The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of oral antibiotics compared to parenteral antibiotics in the treatment of pneumonia in children less than five years old. Oral therapy appears to be an effective and safe alternative to parenteral antibiotics in hospitalised children with severe pneumonia who do not have any serious signs or symptoms. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the relative benefits and harms of oral antibiotics in children with severe pneumonia if serious signs and symptoms are present or in children with severe pneumonia associated with bacterial confirmation or lobar consolidation on chest X-ray.
We wanted to review the evidence from well-designed clinical trials that compared exercise-based rehabilitation with usual care. We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing exercise training versus usual care in people with PH to see if exercise improved short- and long-term outcomes such as exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, serious side effects and changes in the pressure in the pulmonary circulation. The updated review included 14 studies with 574 people, and we included data from 11 studies in analyses (462 participants). The studies reported that exercise-based rehabilitation may result in large increases in exercise capacity as evaluated by how far people could walk in six minutes and maximal oxygen consumption using a specialised exercise test; however, there was marked variability in this response. Health-related quality of life was also most likely to be improved and exercise-based rehabilitation may also result in a large reduction in the pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Serious side effects were rare and exercise-based rehabilitation was unlikely to increase the risk of them. The evidence from these trials was of low to moderate quality. The main limitations in the studies was a lack of allocation concealment (participants knew whether they were in the exercise group or not, which could cause bias) and studies did not report the results of all the outcome data. In addition, some outcomes, for example exercise capacity, had a variable response, which we could not explain by examining different subgroups of people. The evidence is current to 28 June 2022.
This Cochrane review has indicated that there are no randomised controlled trials to compare management options in this vital area, therefore trials should be undertaken as a matter of urgency. Current use of endotherapies in the care of patients with early cancer or high-grade dysplasia of Barrett's oesophagus should be at the recommendation of the multi-disciplinary team involved in individual care. Properly conducted randomised controlled trials comparing surgery with endotherapies should be conducted before any conclusions can be drawn.
The evidence on which this review is based is up-to-date as of May 2016. We found 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of medical and complementary treatments, which involved 909 participants in total. Treatments included herbal extracts, anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin A, beta carotene supplements and others. Surgical treatment has not been compared with placebo or no treatment in an RCT. Cancer development was measured in studies of three treatments: systemic vitamin A, systemic beta carotene and topical bleomycin. None of these treatments showed effectiveness in preventing cancer development, as measured up to two years for vitamin A and beta carotene, and seven years for bleomycin.
Some individual studies of vitamin A and beta carotene suggested that these treatments may be effective for improving or healing oral lesions. However, some studies observed a high rate of relapse in participants whose lesions were initially resolved by treatment.
Most treatments caused side effects of differing severity in a high proportion of participants.
It seems likely that interventions were well accepted by participants because drop-out rates were similar between treatment and control groups. The available evidence is very limited. Most interventions were assessed by only one small study. Most studies had problems in the way they were conducted, making their results unreliable. We judged the quality of evidence for the outcome of cancer development to be very low. Larger, better studies of longer duration are required. As well as further studies of drug treatment and alternative treatments like vitamins, studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of surgery, and of stopping risk factor habits such as smoking.
One study randomly assigned 166 preterm infants and reported data on 144 infants. The included study was completed before the introduction of surfactant and widespread use of antenatal steroids. This trial demonstrated no differences in outcomes among infants who received high-frequency jet ventilation. In this trial, cross-over to the alternate treatment was permitted if initial treatment failed. Investigators found no statistically significant differences in overall mortality (including survival after cross-over) between the two groups. In a secondary analysis, researchers showed that rescue treatment with HFJV, up to the time of cross-over, was associated with lower mortality. Researchers reported no differences in the incidence of chronic lung disease among survivors at 28 days of age, and they found no differences in intraventricular haemorrhage, new air leaks, airway obstruction and necrotising tracheobronchitis. Existing evidence does not support the use of rescue high-frequency jet ventilation compared with conventional mechanical ventilation for treatment of preterm infants with severe pulmonary problems. Additional research is needed.
Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of methotrexate either taken alone or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for people with rheumatoid arthritis. After searching for all relevant studies up to January 19, 2016, they found 158 studies with over 37,000 people. These studies were published between 1985 and 2016 and were between 12 weeks and 2 years in duration. Their findings are summarised below:
In people with rheumatoid arthritis, compared to taking methotrexate alone:
-The combination of methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate + most biologic DMARDs improves disease activity. Other treatment combinations (methotrexate + hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate + leflunomide, methotrexate + gold injections) may improve disease activity in people who do not respond to methotrexate alone.
-The combinations of methotrexate + several biologic DMARDs (adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, or infliximab) reduces joint damage (as seen on x-rays) slightly over one year in patients who have not taken methotrexate before.
-The combinations of methotrexate + azathioprine, methotrexate + cyclosporine and methotrexate + tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) probably increases the chance of stopping the medication due to a side effect.
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is methotrexate and other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs?
When you have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. There is no cure for RA at present, so the treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. Fortunately, there are many medications that can control the disease effectively. These medications are known as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARDs. Methotrexate is widely regarded as the preferred DMARD for most patients with RA as it works well for most patients and is generally well tolerated. Methotrexate can be used by itself or can be combined with other DMARDs. These other DMARDs include medications that have been available and used for many years (such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine), as well as newer more expensive treatments (biologic DMARDs and tofacitinib). It is important to understand how all of these treatments compare in terms of the benefits and side effects.
What happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate combined with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs?
A) People who have not taken methotrexate before:
ACR 50 (number of tender or swollen joints and other outcomes such as pain and disability)
-61 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine and 56 to 67 people out of 100 who took methotrexate + biologic DMARDs or tofacitinib experienced improvement in the symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis, compared to 41 out of 100 people who took methotrexate alone.
X-rays of the joints:
-People who took methotrexate combined with adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, or infliximab had a small reduction in the progression of joint damage (Sharp-van der Heijde score) over one year compared to oral methotrexate, but the estimated amount of damage even with oral methotrexate was very small (2.6 point increase).
Stopping the medication due to a side effect
-36 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + azathioprine had to stop the medication due to a side effect, compared to 8 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone.
B) People who have taken methotrexate before:
ACR 50 (number of tender or swollen joints and other outcomes such as pain and disability)
-61 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine and 27 to 64 people out of 100 who took methotrexate + biologic DMARDs or tofacitinib experienced improvement in the symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis, compared to 13 out of 100 people who took methotrexate alone.
X-rays of the joints:
-No treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of joint damage seen on x-rays over one year.
Stopping the medication due to a side effect
-21 out of
The review of 11 trials involving 2301 people found that using corticosteroids to prevent (or treat) stridor after extubation has not been proven overall effective for babies or children, but this intervention does merit further study particularly for those at high risk to fail extubation. For high risk adults, multiple doses of corticosteroids begun 12-24 hours before extubation appear to be helpful.
We found two studies that examined a psychosocial intervention for women who had undergone removal of their fallopian tubes and ovaries to reduce their risk of tubo-ovarian cancer.
One randomised controlled trial (a study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) assessed a mindfulness-based stress reduction training programme for menopausal symptoms after risk-reducing surgery. Whilst there was improvement in the menopause-specific quality of life scores in the short and the long term for women with menopausal symptoms, the intervention was not associated an with improvement in sexual functioning or distress.
Women who participated in a non-randomised study all received the study intervention and scored themselves on certain items related to psychosexual functioning and psychological adjustment before and after the intervention (targeted sexual-health education, body awareness and relaxation training, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy strategies). They also received a group psychoeducation session and telephone counselling. The outcomes were based on the differences between the before and after scores. All women recruited to the study were at risk of tubo-ovarian cancer based on having a harmful or faulty BRCA gene, but there was no personal history of tubo-ovarian cancer in the group studied.
No studies reported on social and psychological interventions following risk-reducing surgery to have breast tissue removed in BRCA carriers. The certainty (quality) of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, with only one randomised controlled trial and one non-randomised study that had no comparator included in the review. Both studies involved small numbers of women. The limited, moderate- to very low-certainty evidence meant that we were unable to draw any conclusions regarding psychosocial interventions following risk-reducing surgery in female BRCA carriers on improvement in quality of life and psychological (emotional) adjustment. Further research is required to determine how best to support women who choose to have risk-reducing surgery.
We found 76 studies, involving a total of 10,979 adults with 10,988 hip fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 54 to 85 years and 72% were women; this is usual for people who have this type of fracture.
We found that there is probably little difference between treatment with a cephalomedullary nail or an extramedullary implant in the number of people who die within four months of surgery or at 12 months. There may be little or no difference in the number of people who experience confusion (also called delirium) after their surgery, and little or no difference in hip function (ability to use the hip) at four months after surgery. There may also be little or no difference in the number of people who need an additional operation on their broken hip. We are unsure whether there is a difference in how well a person can perform their daily activities, or in their health-related quality of life at four months. We are also unsure whether cephalomedullary nails improve a person's ability to walk independently (with no more than one walking stick) at four months.
We also looked at possible side effects (or harms) from the fracture itself or from using one or other of the implants. For most types of common side effects in hip fracture surgery, there was no evidence of a difference between these two types of implants. We found that fewer people had an infection at the site of surgery, or a broken bone that failed to heal (called a non-union), when a cephalomedullary nail was used. However, more people had a fracture during or after surgery when a cephalomedullary nail was used. - We are moderately confident in the findings about how many people die after surgery. A large number of studies reported this, and the findings were often similar.
- We were less confident about the evidence for delirium, hip function, and additional operations. These findings included the possibility of a benefit with one of the treatments (for example, fewer operations) as well as the possibility of harm (for example, more operations).
- We were very unsure about the findings for how well people could perform their daily activities. This was because we could not explain the wide differences between findings in each study.
- We were unsure about the findings for health-related quality of life because we could not account for the number of participants lost during study follow-up.
- We were also unsure about the findings for a person's ability to walk independently four months after surgery. This was because studies measured walking ability in different ways, and they sometimes had different findings.
All the evidence that we found included at least some studies that had not clearly reported methods used to randomise participants (i.e. to allocate them by chance) to one of the two types of implants. These studies, with less rigorous study designs, might affect our findings. The evidence is up-to-date to July 2020.
we searched for studies that had been published up to 1 August 2019. We identified three randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 114 adults (228 eyes) from three countries (New Zealand, Japan and China) that had been published between 2015 and 2019. The maximum time that people in the studies were followed up for after the treatment was nine months. because of very low-quality evidence, we are unclear about the effect of IPL on dry eye symptoms. IPL may be helpful to improve some of the clinical signs of MGD (such as tear stability and tear composition - both signs of how healthy the tears produced by the eye are). We are uncertain about the effect of IPL on meibomian gland blockage or corneal sodium fluorescein staining.
As most studies did not report side effects, we are uncertain about the safety of IPL as a treatment for MGD. Very low-quality results from individual studies suggest there may be some side effects, including mild eye pain and burning, and partially losing eyelashes (due to mistakes when using the IPL device). the evidence for how effective and safe IPL is for treating MGD was of low or very low quality. due to limited information in the clinical trials, we could not determine with certainty whether IPL treatment for MGD is effective or safe. The review findings indicate that more research is needed. It is important that eye care clinicians, and people considering having IPL as a dry eye treatment, are aware that there is limited high-quality research to understand whether the procedure is effective or safe.
We searched for all studies that tested whether therapies were effective and safe at treating high potassium published up to 18 August 2015. We found seven studies that investigated drug therapies for treating hyperkalaemia in adults which together included results from 241 participants. Most studies tested the therapies in male and female adults with kidney problems who were medically stable. We did not find any studies that looked at the serious medical complications of high potassium such as death.
We found that salbutamol and insulin-dextrose were effective in reducing potassium levels in the blood. We found that salbutamol was effective whether it was given intravenously or by nebuliser. Those treatments appeared to be more effective than other treatments such as sodium bicarbonate and aminophylline. None of the studies found any serious adverse reactions to the medications.
Overall, the quality of evidence was assessed as poor because the studies were small in size and the methods for how the studies were performed were not well described. None of the studies looked at the serious problems caused by hyperkalaemia and this limited the strength of the evidence.
However, we did identify two randomised controlled trials looking at birth-related outcomes among women who were monitored using a CTG with an ES compared to women who were monitored using CTG without an ES. Although the review identified two eligible randomised controlled trials that were at a low risk of bias, only one trial (involving 220 women) examined the outcomes of interest in this review. Data relating to death of the baby within the first 28 days of life (early neonatal death) was unavailable but the study reported that none of the babies died before being born (fetal deaths).
There was no strong evidence that CTG with an ES reduces the likelihood of caesarean delivery, forceps-assisted vaginal birth or adverse baby outcomes (such as fetal acidaemia, neonatal seizures, brain injury due to lack of oxygen (hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy), Apgar score less than seven at five minutes or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit).
These results should be interpreted with caution since the trial was underpowered as too few women were included in the trial to detect modest differences in adverse outcomes. Larger randomised controlled trials are necessary to see if CTG with an ES reduces adverse outcomes for women and their babies during the birth.
Six trials were found. Four examined the safety and efficacy of BoNT-A and two examined benztropine and glycopyrrolate. No trials were found on other interventions. The quality of trials was variable. The trials all differed in the children recruited, the product used, how the product was delivered and how its effectiveness was measured. All trials reported a positive reduction in drooling and all showed some statistically significant change for treatment groups up to 1 month post intervention. Few studies examined client and/or carer satisfaction with the intervention. Some looked at side effects of the intervention but no study examined the effect of interventions on the child's quality of life or psychological well being.
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of one intervention over another. As trials on just two kinds of interventions were retrieved, and given the variation and quality of these studies, it is not possible to conclude that one intervention is more effective than another. The lack of trials on other interventions does not suggest that these interventions are ineffective.
Adequately powered well designed trials are required across all interventions. In addition to using sensitive measures looking at change in salivary flow, measures are needed that examine client and carer satisfaction, changes in quality of life, psychological well being and in unwanted symptoms associated with drooling.
This updated review assessed the therapeutic effects and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs as an alternative and adjunctive therapy to other commonly used drugs for influenza. Eighteen studies involving 2521 participants were included in the review. 'Ganmao' capsules were found to be more effective than amantadine in decreasing influenza symptoms and aiding recovery in one study (in which adverse reactions were mentioned in the amantadine group although no data were reported). There were no significant differences between 'E Shu You' and ribavirin in treating influenza, nor in the occurrence of adverse reactions. The remaining 17 Chinese herbal trials showed a similar effect to antiviral drugs in preventing or treating influenza. However, since these included studies were of poor quality, the evidence does not support or reject the use of any Chinese herbal preparations for influenza. High-quality trials are required.
Population based studies suggest the prevalence of pes cavus is approximately 10%, and its cause is primarily neuromuscular (for example Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) or idiopathic (unknown) in nature. It has been estimated that 60% of people with cavus feet will experience chronic foot pain at some time in their life, most commonly beneath the forefoot (for example metatarsalgia, sesamoiditis) or heel (for example plantar fasciitis). Conditions such as these are thought to be the result of abnormal pressure distribution across the sole of the foot during walking. Many conservative therapies and surgical procedures have been recommended for cavus-related foot pain. In particular, foot orthoses (aids applied and worn on the outside of the body to support the bony structures) customised to an individual's foot shape are increasingly prescribed by podiatrists, physiotherapists, orthopaedic surgeons and rehabilitation specialists for people with pes cavus pain. This updated review analysed four relevant trials, but only one fully met the inclusion criteria. This trial with 154 adults showed that custom-made foot orthoses can reduce and redistribute plantar foot pressure and subsequently decrease foot pain by approximately 75%. Some biomechanical outcomes, such as pressure distribution, improve with custom-made foot orthoses and footwear, but many other biomechanical outcomes, such as foot alignment or muscle activity, do not improve with botulinum toxin or off-the-shelf foot orthoses, respectively. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of other interventions for people with painful high-arched feet.
A search for randomised controlled trials that could be relevant to this review was carried out on 6 June 2015, and another search was carried out 8 October 2018. This was achieved by searching the Specialised Register of Cochrane Schizophrenia. The 2015 search found six possible trials and we carefully checked these to see if we could include them in the review. The 2018 search found no new trials. Five trials, randomising a total of 343 participants met the review requirements for inclusion. These trials randomly allocated participants to receive either chlorpromazine or piperacetazine. Data were reported for participants' global and mental state after treatment, incidence of adverse effects and numbers leaving the trial early. However, we did not find any data concerning service use, functioning of participants or economic costs of these treatments. The overall results showed chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy and side effect profiles. However, these results are based on very low-quality data. The number of included studies and the sample size of participants included in this review is small, and the quality of data very low, so the results of this review are not conclusive and must be used with caution. Further research would be needed before decisions can be made regarding which drug is more effective.
This study shows that people treated this way do manage to stay out of hospital longer than people treated by conventional systems of care. There are also some data showing that although these systems are expensive to start off with, if they are successful at keeping people out of hospital, then the cost saving from this means that they are cheaper in the long run.
We wanted to find out if fenoldopam was better than other treatments to prevent AKI and if fenoldopam helps treat people who are in the early stages of AKI. We also wanted to find out if fenoldopam was associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that examined the use of fenoldopam compared with active medications (medicines known to be used for preventing AKI), placebo (dummy medicine) or saline (salt solution) in people who are at risk of developing AKI or treating those who already have AKI. We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the methods and size of the study. We found 25 studies involving 3339 people; 24 were in adults, and one was in children. Of these, 23 studies were in people at risk of AKI, and two studies were in people with established AKI. The studies were conducted in only three countries: the USA, Italy and Ireland. We found that in people at risk of AKI, fenoldopam lowered the chances of getting AKI and may reduce the time spent in ICU when compared to those who received a placebo or saline. However, in those with AKI, it is uncertain whether fenoldopam reduces the number of people needing kidney replacement therapy (using machines to filter the blood) compared with those who received a placebo or saline. For side effects, there was no difference between fenoldopam and placebo or saline for either preventing or treating AKI. When fenoldopam was compared to dopamine (an active medication) there may be little or no difference in the number developing AKI, those needing kidney replacement therapy, or in the risk of dying. The effect of fenoldopam compared to other active medications is unclear. The small number of studies (per comparison) and the small size of the studies were limitations in this review. Not all the studies provided data about the outcomes we were interested in. We are moderately confident that fenoldopam reduces the chance of getting AKI compared to placebo or saline. We are less confident in the results for the need for kidney replacement therapy and time spent in the ICU. We have little confidence in the evidence for the use of fenoldopam compared to other active medications for preventing AKI. The evidence is up to date as of 12 November 2024.
We identified 23 studies involving 2212 participants between 17 and 67 years old with a diagnosis of RVVC confirmed by a positive test. The studies compared a range of antifungal medicines (taken by mouth or inserted into the vagina), and some complementary or alternative treatments (such as Lactobacillus vaccines or probiotics and special underwear). The studies reported the effects on recurrence of thrush after 6 and 12 months. Only one study reported the number of clinical recurrences at 12 months. Nine studies reported industry funding, three were funded by an independent source and nine studies did not report their funding source. The evidence is current to October 2021. Six studies (607 participants) compared antifungal medication with placebo or no treatment. Based on low certainty evidence antifungal treatments may give a clinically relevant reduction in clinical recurrence at 6 and 12 months. We are uncertain if oral treatments are better than topical treatments (very low certainty evidence for no difference).
Adverse effects of taking antifungal medication to prevent recurrence of thrush were not common. Studies reported on adverse effects differently, making comparisons difficult. More research is needed to determine the optimal medication, dose and frequency. We were unable to determine the effects in women who are pregnant or have diabetes. Our confidence in the evidence was low to very low due to serious concerns about risk of bias, unclear reporting and the limited number of studies that could be combined. This means that new studies might change our confidence in the effects of treatments and our conclusions.
We searched the medical literature for studies that compared lens extraction with other treatments for chronic PACG, compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found eight studies comprising 513 eyes with chronic PACG that met our inclusion criteria. The studies followed participants for six to 69 months, and compared lens extraction against:
- laser therapy;
- lens extraction plus an injection of thick liquid to break iris adhesions with the aim of encouraging fluid outflow (viscogonioplasty, VGP);
- lens extraction plus breaking the iris adhesions mechanically, known as goniosynechialysis (GSL);
- trabeculectomy (creating a flap to facilitate fluid drainage); and
- lens extraction plus trabeculectomy.
These are the main findings of our review, focusing on results one year after treatment (unless otherwise stated).
1. Lens extraction compared with laser therapy (1 study)
When compared against laser therapy, the evidence suggests that lens extraction probably:
- limits loss of visual field (the area that can be seen when the eye is looking straight ahead);
- reduces the number of pressure-lowering medicines needed;
- open the drainage angle more; and
- makes little or no difference to quality of life, vision clarity, or eye pressure.
One person treated with lens extraction, and three people treated with laser therapy, experienced irreversible loss of 10 or more EDTRS letters of vision in the three years after treatment.
2. Lens extraction compared with lens extraction plus VGP (1 study)
When compared against lens extraction plus VGP, the evidence suggests that lens extraction may:
- reduce the number of pressure-lowering medications needed;
- open the drainage angle more; and
- make little or no difference to clarity of vision.
There is uncertain evidence as to whether the two treatments have different effects on eye pressure. The study did not investigate the effects on visual field loss and quality of life.
Eye inflammation occurred in two people treated with lens extraction, and in four people treated with lens extraction plus VGP. Three people treated with lens extraction plus VGP experienced bleeding in the front of the eye.
3. Lens extraction compared with lens extraction plus GSL (2 studies)
When compared against lens extraction plus GSL, the evidence suggests that lens extraction:
- probably does not reduce the number of pressure-lowering medications needed; and
- may make little or no difference to eye pressure.
The studies did not investigate the effects on visual field loss, eye drainage, vision clarity, and quality of life.
Bleeding in the front of the eye occurred in three eyes treated with lens extraction plus GSL.
4. Lens extraction compared with lens extraction plus trabeculectomy (3 studies)
When compared against lens extraction plus trabeculectomy, the evidence from one study suggests that lens extraction may make little or no difference to:
- eye pressure;
- the number of pressure-lowering medications needed; and
- vision clarity.
There is uncertain evidence as to whether one treatment leads to more unwanted effects than the other. The studies did not investigate the effects on visual field loss, eye drainage, and quality of life. The evidence suggests that:
- lens extraction is probably a better treatment than laser therapy for chronic PACG;
- combining lens extraction with VGP or GSL may not work better than lens extraction alone; and
- there is uncertain evidence as to whether combining lens extraction with trabeculectomy makes a difference. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 13 December 2019.
In most trials, individuals were put into different treatment groups at random with equal chances of being given either placebo or ivacaftor; no one could work out which treatment the next person would receive, so that healthier people did not receive ivacaftor and make the results seem better. We were not sure whether anyone involved in the trial knew who was receiving which treatment and how this might affect results. No trials reported all results clearly; sometimes they did not report them in a way that we could use in the review and sometimes they did not report the data at all. This affected our certainty regarding the overall results. Information about some side effects was limited as not many people experienced them, therefore, it is difficult to judge whether there was a difference between treatment groups
We judged the evidence in this review to be moderate to low quality. All trials were sponsored by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated. The National Institute of Health (NIH), the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and other non-pharmaceutical funding bodies also supported the trials.
We wanted to find out if alpha-lipoic acid was better than no treatment or placebo (dummy treatment) for improving symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, impairment, quality of life, and complications of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (ulceration, amputation, or both) in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We also wanted to know if alpha-lipoic acid had any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that investigated alpha-lipoic acid treatment compared to no treatment or placebo for at least six months. We analysed and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the findings. We found three studies that analysed 816 adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The participants received either alpha-lipoic acid or placebo. The dose of alpha-lipoic acid ranged from 600 mg/day to 1800 mg/day.
Alpha-lipoic acid compared to placebo probably has little or no effect on symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and may have little or no effect on impairment after six months of treatment. There is probably little or no difference between alpha-lipoic acid and placebo in terms of unwanted effects that cause people to stop treatment.
No studies measured the effect of alpha-lipoic acid treatment on quality of life or complications of peripheral neuropathy.
Until alpha-lipoic acid is proven effective, there is no rationale for comparing it with active treatments. We are moderately confident in the evidence on symptoms and unwanted effects because in all three studies, the investigators lost contact with many participants before the end of treatment (loss to follow-up). We have little confidence in the evidence on impairment, because of loss to follow-up and because the result was very imprecise. The evidence is current to 11 September 2022.
This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of azapirones compared to other treatments. From the results of 36 randomized controlled trials, azapirones appear to be superior to placebo in short-term studies (four to nine weeks) but may not be superior to benzodiazepines. We were unable to conclude if azapirones were superior to antidepressants, psychotherapy or kava kava. As GAD is generally chronic in nature, conclusions about azapirones' long-term efficacy are not able to be made and longer term trials are needed.
This review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10-minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow-up were high and 285 completed the post-test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow-up were high and 2790 completed both pre-test and post-test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow-up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow-up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group).
Both trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited.
We included eight studies (specifically, randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) with a total of 559 people aged between 17 and 76 years old. The evidence is current to April 2018. All studies recruited outpatients from endoscopy centres (centres that specialise in an examination done with a flexible tube with a camera that is inserted into stomach) in several countries. The antibiotic combinations tested were very different in the included studies, as were the doses of NAC (600 mg to 1800 mg per day). NAC was compared with placebo (dummy pill) or nothing. We are uncertain whether the addition of NAC to antibiotics improves H pylori cure rates compared with the addition of placebo or no NAC. Any possible beneficial effect of NAC should be regarded cautiously because the included studies were very different and of low certainty, with some flaws that could have compromised their results and consequently, the results of this review.
We are uncertain whether NAC is associated with a higher risk of gastrointestinal or allergic adverse events compared with placebo or no NAC. There were no reports of toxic adverse events amongst the included studies.
Further large, well-designed randomised clinical studies, with good reporting standards and appropriate collection of effectiveness and safety outcomes should be done, especially for current recommended antibiotic combinations. The overall certainty of the evidence for eradication rates ranged from very low to low. Five studies provided information on adverse events (side effects), and the certainy of evidence was very low. The included studies were poorly conducted and this reduced our confidence in the results.
This Cochrane review is current to November 2017. Studies compared vertebroplasty versus placebo (no cement injected) (five studies, 541 participants); usual care (eight studies, 1136 participants); kyphoplasty (similar, but before cement is injected a balloon is expanded in the fractured vertebra; seven studies, 968 participants) and facet joint steroid injection (one study, 217 participants). Trials were performed in hospitals in 15 countries, the majority of participants were female, mean age ranged between 63.3 and 80 years, and symptom duration ranged from a week to six months or more. Eight trials received at least some funding from medical device manufacturers and only two reported that they had no role in the trial. Compared with a placebo (fake) procedure, vertebroplasty resulted in little benefit at one month:
Pain (lower scores mean less pain)
Improved by 7% (3% better to 12% better), or 0.7 points (0.3 better to 1.2 better) on a zero-0 to 10-point scale.
• People who had vertebroplasty rated their pain as 4.3 points.
• People who had placebo rated their pain as 5 points.
Disability (lower scores mean less disability)
Improved by 7% (2% better to 11% better), or 1.5 points (0.4 better to 2.6 better) on a zero to 23-point scale.
• People who had vertebroplasty rated their disability as 12.7 points.
• People who had placebo rated their disability as 14.2 points.
Vertebral fracture or osteoporosis-specific quality of life (lower scores mean better quality of life)
Better by 2% (1% worse to 6% better), or 2.33 points better (1.41 worse to 6.06 better) on a zero to 100-point scale.
• People who had vertebroplasty rated their quality of life related to their fracture as 59.7 points.
• People who had placebo rated their quality of life related to their fracture as 62 points.
Overall quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life)
Improved by 5% (1% better to 9% better), or 0.05 units (0.01 better to 0.09 better) on a zero = death to one = perfect health scale.
• People who had vertebroplasty rated their general quality of life as 0.43 points.
• People who had placebo rated their general quality of life as 0.38 points.
Treatment success (defined as pain moderately or a great deal better)
9% more people rated their treatment a success (11% fewer to 29% more), or nine more people out of 100.
• 32 out of 100 people reported treatment success with vertebroplasty.
• 23 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo.
Compared with a placebo or usual care:
New symptomatic vertebral fractures (at 12 to 24 months)
3% more new fractures with vertebroplasty (8% fewer to 13% more), or one more person out of 100.
• 10 out of 100 people had a new fracture with vertebroplasty.
• 7 out of 100 people had a new fracture with placebo or usual care.
Other serious adverse events:
1% fewer people (6% fewer to 4% more), had other serious adverse events with vertebroplasty; relative change 39% fewer (67% fewer to 10% more).
• 4 out of 100 people reported other serious adverse events with vertebroplasty.
• 5 out of 100 people reported other serious adverse events with placebo. High-quality evidence shows that vertebroplasty does not provide more clinically important benefits than placebo. We are less certain of the risk of new vertebral fractures or other serious effects; quality was moderate due to the small number of events.
Serious adverse events that may occur include spinal cord or nerve root compression due to cement leaking out from the bone, cement leaking into the blood stream, rib fractures, infection in the bone, fat leaking into the bloodstream, damage to the covering of the spinal cord that could result in leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, anaesthetic complications and death.
We found three studies with 613 adults, who had 617 open fractures. Most fractures were in men, and the average age was 30 to 34 years. In two studies, the open fractures were in the shin bone (a common place for this type of injury because there is not much skin and muscle between the bone and skin surface). In the other study, injuries were in arms and legs.
One study compared giving antibiotics for 24 hours (short course) with five days of antibiotics (long course). It is unclear if these treatment times had an effect on the number of people who developed superficial infections within 14 days. Superficial infections are in the skin around the wound, but not deep enough to affect the bone; they may occur early in the recovery period and can be easily treated with antibiotics only.
Two studies compared closing the wound immediately after fixing the bone with a delay to closing the wound. It is unclear if timing of wound closure had an effect on the number of people who developed deep infections, superficial infections, or had delayed bone union (when the broken parts of the bone heal together more slowly than expected) or non-union (when the bone does not heal).
None of the studies looked at how well a person can move their injured arm or leg, or the health-related quality of life of people six to 12 months after treatment.
We found no studies that compared starting antibiotics immediately or later, whether wound cleaning started within 12 hours of the injury or later, or whether the different stages of treatment happened at the same time or separately. We are not very confident in these findings because:
- we only had information from one small study about how long antibiotics are given, and from two studies about when the wound is closed;
- the studies were not well reported, and one was only reported in a short summary;
- all of the findings included the possibility of benefit (for example, fewer infections with a short course of antibiotics) as well as the possibility of harm (for example, more infections with a short course of antibiotics). The evidence is up to date to February 2021.
Study characteristics: This updated Cochrane review included 17 studies involving 2434 critically ill men and women who were being cared for in medical, surgical, neurosurgical and mixed medical/surgical intensive care units (ICUs). The studies compared the use of protocols to wean patients from the ventilator against usual practice. They were conducted in ICUs in America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The ICUs cared for patients with heart conditions, breathing difficulties, head injuries, trauma and following major surgery. In 13 studies, clinicians used weaning protocols to guide them to reduce the ventilator support. In four studies ventilator support was reduced automatically by programmed computers following a protocol.
Results: In comparison with usual practice without protocols, the average total time spent on the ventilator was reduced by 26%. The duration of weaning was reduced by 70% and length of stay in the ICU reduced by 11%. Using protocols did not result in any additional harms. We found considerable variation in the types of protocols used, the criteria for considering when to start weaning, the medical conditions of the patients and usual practice in weaning. This means that we cannot say exactly which protocols will work best for particular patients, but we do know they have not been beneficial in neurosurgical patients.
Quality of evidence: We graded the quality of the available evidence as moderate for duration of ventilation and harmful effects, and low for the duration of weaning and ICU length of stay. The reasons for our grading were that results were not consistent across the studies, and studies lacked sufficient detail about usual care practices.
For participants needing additional pain relief, combined analysis of opioids (pentazocine and morphine) showed a significant benefit when compared with non-opioid treatments. Two trials showed that buprenorphine and pentazocine were each more effective than procaine. Our confidence in the stability of these effects is low, however, due to limitations in the number of studies and participants, and the low quality of the way the trials were run and reported. No serious or life-threatening adverse events were linked to the drugs being studied. One death was reported, in a procaine group, across all the included trials.
On the evidence so far, opioids may be an appropriate treatment option and might have the advantage of decreasing the need for additional pain relief. We found no clear difference in the risk of pancreatitis complications or serious adverse event between opioids and other pain relief treatments. However, the findings of this review are limited by the lack of information to allow full appraisal of the risk of bias, the measurement of relevant outcomes and the small numbers of participants covered by the trials.
Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of seven trials suggests a significant treatment effect for the total score on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale in favour of kava extract. Few adverse events were reported in the reviewed trials, which were all mild, transient and infrequent. These data imply that, compared with placebo, kava extract might be an effective symptomatic treatment for anxiety although, at present, the size of the effect seems to be small. Rigorous trials with large sample sizes are needed to clarify the existing uncertainties. Particularly long-term safety studies of kava are needed.
We found no randomised controlled trials, and identified only one non-randomised study published 30 years ago, on this topic. This study included 77 participants who had stomach ulcer and in whom medical therapy had failed after an average treatment duration of 29 months. Medical therapy included histamine H2 receptor blockers (medicines that block the action of the chemical histamine, resulting in a decreased production of stomach acid, such as ranitidine), antacids, and diet. It must be highlighted that this form of medical treatment is not considered to be as effective as treatment with proton pump inhibitors. The authors do not state whether these were recurrent or refractory ulcers. Of the 77 included participants, 37 participants continued to have medical therapy, while 40 participants received surgical therapy. Whether to use medical or surgical treatment was determined by participant's or treating physician's preference. The evidence is current to September 2015. The study authors reported that two participants in the medical treatment group (5%) had stomach cancer, which was identified after repeated examinations using a camera to look inside the body (an endoscope), in this case, the stomach and small intestine. They did not report the percentage of participants who had stomach cancer in the surgical treatment group. They also did not report the implications of the delayed diagnosis of stomach cancer in the medical treatment group. They did not report any other outcomes of interest (measures by which one treatment can be considered better than another) for this review (that is health-related quality of life, treatment-related complications, peptic ulcer-related complications, abdominal pain, and long-term deaths). There is thus no study that provides the relative benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers. Studies on this topic are urgently required. Since the only study that compared medical and surgical treatment in people with refractory or recurrent ulcers did not report any of the outcomes in a sufficiently detailed manner, we were not able to assess the quality of evidence in a formal way.
The current review includes 39 trials with a total of 3509 participants and confirms its efficacy compared to placebo or no treatment. This finding is important, because the efficacy of antidepressants has recently been questioned. However, the review also demonstrated that amitriptyline produces a number of side effects such as vision problems, constipation and sedation. It is a limitation of this review that many studies have been poorly reported, which might have led to bias.
In this review, the authors looked for studies (randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) from around the world to find out how women with ovarian cancer were assessed to see if they were eating and drinking well and what help they may be given with nutrition before or after surgery. A lack of information was found on this topic.
One RCT was found where a small group of women (40 including 35 with ovarian cancer) requiring extensive elective surgery for gynaecological cancer including surgery to the gut, were able to restart eating normal foods on the day after surgery. They were able to leave hospital earlier and did not have more complications in the month after surgery than women who were not allowed to resume eating normal foods until at least three days after the operation.
More studies are needed to confirm whether restarting normal eating one day after surgery can be recommended for women having surgery for ovarian cancer. More research is needed to provide information about how to identify and treat problems of malnutrition in women with ovarian cancer.
We wanted to find out the best combination of hormones that would allow women to have a baby after they suffered from early failure of the ovaries. We also wanted to find out the unwanted effects of the hormone treatments used to treat early failure of the ovaries. We followed standard Cochrane methods to search for studies, compare and summarise the results of the studies, and rate our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and study sizes. We found three studies that recruited a total of 52 women with early failure of the ovaries. We are uncertain of the effect of any hormonal therapy when compared to the others. The main limitation was the small number of studies, which had very small numbers of women in each study (ranged from 12 to 20 women in each one). The evidence is up to date to September 2021.
The review authors considered the effectiveness of teriflunomide mainly in terms of the number of participants with at least one relapse, the number of people with disability progression, the annualized rate of relapse (number of relapses per participant-year) and the time to disability progression. They evaluated safety as the number of participants with side effects, number of participants with serious side effects, and number of participants who withdrew or dropped out from the study because of side effects at one year or two years. Among the pertinent literature, five studies met the inclusion criteria. They involved 3231 participants and evaluated the effectiveness and safety of teriflunomide alone or with another medicine called interferon-β (IFNβ), versus placebo (a pretend medicine) or IFNβ-1a. The evidence is current to September 2015. The authors found low-quality evidence that both doses of teriflunomide reduced the occurrence of relapses after one year or two years of treatment, while there is very low-quality evidence showing that the medicine prevented disability progression at one year or two years. High-dose rather than low-dose teriflunomide had a similar efficacy to IFNβ-1a in reducing relapse at one year, but the quality of evidence was very low. As far as safety was concerned, the most commonly reported side effects were diarrhoea (frequent, loose stools), nausea (feeling sick), hair thinning, neutropenia (low levels of white blood cells called neutrophils, which fight off infection) and lymphopenia (low levels of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which fight off infection). In general, these side effects are mild to moderate, and do not usually lead to treatment being stopped, but higher dose is more prone to cause these side effects. The low/very low quality of the results is mainly due to the inadequate blinding of relapse assessment (assessors were aware of which treatment the person had received), the high dropout rate (people left the trial), disability progression confirmed in less than six months, the low number of participants, and the different length of treatments within the studies. The duration of the studies is a key point for a lifetime disease with chances of chronic treatments as MS, also suggesting the need of studies with a longer period of monitoring (follow-up). The five studies included in this review were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, and this is known as a potential source of conflict of interest and thus of bias.
We searched widely for studies on this topic and found six small trials involving a total of 90 people with MMN who received IVIg treatment. Three studies had limitations, and there was not enough information about the remaining studies to permit a full assessment. Five trials compared an infusion (slow injection) of IVIg with a dummy infusion. The remaining trial compared two different administration routes: IVIg infusion versus SCIg infusion. The effects were measured between 4 and 12 weeks after treatment. Two trials involved employees of an immunoglobulin manufacturer as authors. One of these studies, which was also sponsored by the manufacturer, underwent independent manuscript review by experts with full data access. IVIg may improve strength in people with MMN. IVIg may also improve disability, but we need further research to confirm or rule out an effect, as this evidence is less certain. The evidence for whether more people experience side effects on IVIg than with a dummy infusion is uncertain. There was only one serious side effect (pulmonary embolism) during IVIg treatment. Most people with MMN need ongoing immunoglobulin treatment, as disability and muscle strength probably deteriorate with immunoglobulin withdrawal. We need more evidence on whether SCIg might be an alternative to IVIg.
The evidence is current to April 2021.
We included one trial with 91 adult patients, of whom only 42 were analysed. The trial involved five one-hour meditation intervention sessions between admission and discharge of participants newly diagnosed with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukaemia. There was no information about the age of the participants included in the study. All participants in the trial were hospitalised for initial induction chemotherapy. As the abstract of the publication did not provide numbers, it is not possible to describe the results in more detail.
Participants practising meditation reported better physical health and levels of depression could be decreased. Most of our pre-defined outcomes (overall survival, anxiety, fatigue, quality of sleep, and adverse events) were not reported at all. We judge the quality of the evidence for the outcomes quality of life and depression as 'very low', due to high risk of bias (only 42 out 91 participants were evaluated) and very imprecise results. There were not enough data available to determine the effectiveness of meditation practice on haematologically-diseased patients, thus the role of meditation in the treatment of haematological malignancies remains unclear. More high-quality and larger randomised controlled trials are needed to validate possible positive effects of meditation practice for haematologically-diseased patients.
The evidence is up-to-date as of August, 2015.
We included six trials, with a total of 198 participants aged from four weeks to 16 years. The majority were on mechanical ventilators. The timing of interventions ranged from 15 minutes after the child had been settled in a hospital bed, to a maximum of seven days over the duration of the intervention. Only a small number (n = 15) of the children did not have their breathing supported by a ventilator. The trials included in this review were supported by public agencies. Lying on their abdomen appeared to improve the use of oxygen (oxygenation index is the need for additional oxygen relative to the child’s oxygen level) compared to lying on their back. This finding was based on data from three trials with 141 children. Only one trial with 102 children reported adverse effects, which did not differ between the two positions. One trial with 50 children compared lying on their back to other positions, and was not able to show consistent differences in blood oxygenation. There is not enough information to make any conclusions about the benefits and harms of any position in infants and children with acute respiratory distress.  The findings of this review are limited by the small number of identified trials, five of which had fewer than 40 participants; the short duration of the interventions; and the lack of description of how the study authors addressed the risk of bias in their trials. Overall, we are uncertain how different positions affect our main outcomes, such as oxygenation levels. This means that future research is needed to improve the certainty of our results.
We performed a rigorous search of the medical literature in October 2016 and found three studies that compared a single treatment session of BtA with BtB. These studies included a total of 270 participants, with on average a moderate disease impairment. The participants remained in the studies for a short period of time - between 16 and 20 weeks after the treatment. The average age of people in the studies was 53.3 years, and they had had cervical dystonia for an average of 6.6 to 7.9 years before taking part in the trials. Most, 63.3%, of the people in the studies were women. All three of the studies were funded by drug manufacturers with possible interests in the results of the studies. The results show little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the main measures of overall improvement and safety, including the total number of adverse (unwanted or harmful) events. There was also little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the self-evaluations reported by the study participants. Based on the results we would expect that, out of 1000 people with cervical dystonia treated with BtB, there would be 362 more people who experience dry mouth/sore throat compared to 1000 people treated with BtA. The studies which looked at the duration of effect showed little or no difference between BtA and BtB. None of the studies examined the impact of either Bt on quality of life. All of the studies included participants that were different to the average person who suffers from cervical dystonia. To be included participants had to have a history of successful treatment with Bt. People with certain types of cervical dystonia, in particular the forms that make the head turn backward or forward, were not allowed to participate in the studies.
Not enough participants were included across the studies for us to be completely confident in the results for the total number of adverse events, the self-reported evaluations by participants or the pain assessment.
The quality of the evidence for overall improvement and total number of adverse events was low. The quality of the evidence for more sore throat/dry mouth in people receiving BtB is moderate. The quality of the evidence where participants gave their self-assessments is low.
No definite conclusions can be drawn regarding overall safety and long-term utility of BtA compared to BtB in cervical dystonia.
The review of trials found that radiant warmers increase water loss in low birthweight babies in the newborn period when compared to incubators and that this water loss needs to be taken into account when daily fluid requirements are calculated. However, there was not enough information available for this review to enable assessment of other important effects of radiant warmers. Therefore, at the present time, it is not clear which method of maintaining body temperature is best for newborn babies - radiant warmers or incubators. More research is necessary.
We found two small studies with a total of 63 people comparing O&M training delivered by a trained volunteer to physical exercise. These studies did not show a difference between the two interventions, but they had little power to do so because of the small sample size and poor methodological quality. There were no adverse effects of O&M training in these studies.
There is little evidence from randomised controlled trials on which type of O&M training is better for people with low vision who have specific characteristics and needs.
We searched for evidence on 30 November 2016, but found no new studies for this update. We included 12 trials that compared continuous CTG monitoring with intermittent listening, and one trial compared continuous CTG with intermittent CTG. Together, the trials involved over 37,000 women. No trial compared continuous CTG with no monitoring. Most studies were undertaken before 1994, and apart from two, were not high quality. The review was dominated by one large, well-conducted trial from 1985 which involved almost 13,000 women who received one-to-one care throughout labour. The mothers' membranes were ruptured artificially as early as possible and about a quarter received oxytocin to stimulate contractions.
Overall, there was no difference in numbers of babies who died during or shortly after labour (about one in 300) (low quality evidence). Fits in babies were rare (about one in 500 births) (moderate quality evidence), but occurred less often when continuous CTG was used to monitor the baby's heart rate. There was no difference in the rate of cerebral palsy (low quality evidence); however, other possible long-term effects have not been fully assessed and need further study. Continuous monitoring was associated with significantly more deliveries by caesarean section (low quality evidence) and instrumental vaginal births (low quality evidence). Although both procedures carry risks for mothers, these were not assessed in the included studies.
There was no difference in numbers of cord blood acidosis (very low quality evidence), or women using any drugs for pain relief (low quality evidence) between groups.
Compared with intermittent CTG, continuous CTG made no difference to how many women had caesarean sections or instrumental births. There was less cord blood acidosis in women who had intermittent CTG but this result could have been due to chance. Most studies were undertaken many years ago and showed benefits and problems with both methods of monitoring the baby’s wellbeing in labour. Continuous CTG was associated with fewer fits for babies although there was no difference in cerebral palsy; both were rare events. However, continuous CTG was also associated with increased numbers of caesarean sections and instrumental births, both of which carry risks for mothers. Continuous CTG also makes moving and changing positions difficult in labour and women are unable to use a birthing pool. This can impact on women’s coping strategies. Women and their doctors need to discuss the woman’s individual needs and wishes about monitoring the baby’s wellbeing in labour.
Future research should focus on events that happen in pregnancy and labour that could be the cause of long term problems for the baby.
Our search strategy was designed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where RSI was undertaken to secure an artificial airway for a general anaesthetic with or without the application of cricoid pressure. Vomiting or regurgitation of stomach contents during anaesthesia was to be assessed either by looking directly down the airway or by various laboratory and imaging (radiological) methods. We also set out to determine whether applying cricoid pressure caused any harm. We searched the databases until May 2015. Only one RCT met our inclusion criteria but unfortunately this trial did not report on any clinically relevant results. We classified one other trial as ongoing. The researchers have reported on their planned protocol for the clinical trial, where cricoid pressure applied using a measured force will be compared with cricoid pressure without measuring the force applied. The number of patients who vomit is to be monitored. This systematic review shows an absence of evidence regarding the effectiveness and risks of cricoid pressure during RSI for intubation. Little can be said therefore about whether this technique should be continued in clinical practice. One current ongoing study shows promise that it will provide useful information in the future.
We included a total of 10 studies recruiting 6292 apparently healthy adults in this review. The findings of the review indicate that interventions can successfully support adults' attempts to become active and fitter, for example with personal counselling and advice, feedback and offering choices of exercise, and supervision. Outcomes are improved if the intervention comprises a specified type of physical activity and is supervised by a non-health professional using a combination of group and individual approaches. New physical activity can be maintained for up to at least one year and does not increase the risk of falls or exercise related injuries. More research is needed to establish which methods of exercise promotion work best in the long term to encourage specific groups of people to be more physically active.
We found 47 studies that were published up to May 2017. These studies involved 17,039 adults who had major surgery. Twenty-four studies involved 2672 adults having heart surgery. Twenty-three studies involved 14,367 adults undergoing major operations other than heart surgery. Forty studies compared alpha-2 adrenergic agonists to dummy treatment (placebo). The other seven studies compared them to other medicines. Twenty-one studies tested an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist medicine called clonidine, 24 studied another medicine called dexmedetomidine and two studied another medicine called mivazerol. The duration of alpha-2 adrenergic agonist medicine studied varied from one dose before surgery to three days of treatment. Most people who took part in these studies were men, and their average age was 60 to 70 years old. Fourteen studies reported receiving money from the company that manufactured the medicine being tested in the same study. Another 15 studies did not report where they received the money needed to fund the study. The number of people who took part in each study varied between 20 participants to as many as 10,000 participants. Nineteen studies included more than 100 participants. We found that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists generally had no clear benefits for preventing death or major complications after surgery. For people having major operations other than heart surgery, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists did not lower their chances of dying, having a heart attack or having a stroke after surgery. We did not find sufficient evidence that, in people having heart surgery, alpha-2 adrenergic lowered the risk of dying or having a heart attack after surgery. There was some very limited evidence that these medicines might prevent strokes after heart surgery. Nonetheless, more research is needed before we can be certain that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists truly have this benefit. These medicines also had some important side effects. People who received alpha-2 adrenergic agonists were much more likely to have low blood pressures or low heart rates during or after surgery. We assessed the quality of all studies we identified using a specialized tool called the GRADE criteria. In general, we found that most of the evidence in these studies was moderate or high quality. Thus, based on our results, we can be reasonably certain that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are not helpful for reducing the numbers of deaths or major heart complications that happen after surgery.
A former Cochrane review published in 2004 found some evidence of a possible benefit of using oral Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for eczema; however, the results from only 4 included studies were inconclusive and need to be updated (those four studies have not been included in this update as they investigated a product that has been withdrawn from the market since 2004). As well as updating that review, we have also widened the scope of the review to assess the effects of topical CHM for eczema. We wrote a new protocol to expand the scope of this review.
This review included 28 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with 2306 children and adults, of which 4 compared CHM to placebo, 22 to conventional medications, and 2 to CHM taken by mouth.
Most of the included studies reported a higher number of participants who had recovered and significantly improved, with less itching in the CHM groups than the control groups. Where CHM was compared to conventional drugs, although the total effectiveness rate outcome was superior with CHM, it was based on very low quality evidence. One study reported that the quality of life (QoL) score in the CHM group was better than in the placebo group after using a CHM formula taken by mouth for 12 weeks. We assessed most of the studies as at high 'risk of bias' and therefore not of good quality, and there was substantial inconsistency between the studies, so any positive effect in CHM must be treated with caution.
One study reported one severe adverse event. Minor adverse events were observed in 24 studies, including temporary elevation of enzymes in 3 cases, which was reversed soon after stopping CHM.
Eight included studies received government funding.
We could not find conclusive evidence that CHM taken by mouth or applied to the skin was of benefit to children or adults with eczema.
Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM for eczema.
Three studies involving a total of 316 participants were included in this review. Analysis of the results showed that reversion success lies somewhere between 19.4% and 54.3%. We could not calculate the likelihood and severity of side effects (adverse events) as the studies provided insufficient information to perform this analysis. Potential side effects have been reported in other articles on the subject; these have included hypotension (sudden lowering of blood pressure) or syncope (brief loss of consciousness). No side effects were reported in the three studies reviewed here. In the three studies, reversion was achieved on completion of each VM.
Overall, the VM appears to be a simple, non-invasive method of stopping abnormal heart rhythm, but its safety and overall effectiveness are difficult to quantify. Further research is required to improve the evidence surrounding this practice.
We wanted to find out if LipiFlow is as effective or more effective than other common dry eye disease treatments. We also wanted to find out if LipiFlow is safe and if it causes any unwanted side effects. We searched for studies that investigated LipiFlow compared to other common dry eye disease treatments (e.g. warm compresses, thermostatic devices, eyelid hygiene product, topical medications, oral interventions) and looked at how patient-reported symptoms (e.g. eye dryness) and signs (e.g. meibomian gland function, tear breakup time) differed between LipiFlow and other treatments. We analyzed and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 13 trials with a total of 1155 participants (1720 eyes) with dry eye disease.
When comparing LipiFlow to basic warm compresses, eyelid hygiene products, or dry eye disease medications, there was no clear evidence of a difference in improvement in symptom scores obtained using questionnaires or in signs by eye surface tests. Thermostatic devices decreased symptom scores compared with LipiFlow based on one questionnaire, but this result was not found with other questionnaires. LipiFlow may improve symptom scores based on one questionnaire compared with oral intervention.
We found no evidence that LipiFlow is unsafe or causes any unwanted side effects. Our confidence in the evidence is low to very low because the people in the trials were aware of the treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their symptoms responses, and because of differences across the included studies, including in testing regimens. This uncertainty in the evidence makes it challenging to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of LipiFlow compared with other treatments. Limitations related to lack of masking of participants could be addressed in future trials by including a control group who undergoes a sham LipiFlow treatment without thermal pulsation. The evidence is current to October 2022.
We identified 11 trials that enrolled 428 adult participants. These trials were conducted in various countries, including the Czech Republic, Brazil, Italy, Iran, China, Korea, Mexico, Turkey, USA, and UK. Ten out of 11 trials used a paired-eye design, in which one eye of each participant received LASEK and the other eye received PRK. The remaining trial included one eye of six participants and both eyes of 15 participants. Most participants included in the trials had low to moderate myopia. The evidence is current as of 15 December 2015. Because these trials reported different outcomes at different time points, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of LASEK versus PRK across trials. We assessed our primary outcomes 12 months after the surgeries were performed. Available data were insufficient to clarify whether LASEK performed better than PRK with respect to correcting visual acuity to 20/20 or better, achieving within 0.50 diopters of target refraction, or preventing loss of corrected visual acuity. Data were insufficient for assessment of whether differences between procedures in adverse outcomes occurred at 12 months after the surgeries. At 24 months post treatment, one trial reported that eyes treated LASEK with may have better corneal haze scores than those treated with PRK, but that the difference may not be noticeable. Available data were insufficient for investigation of whether LASEK or PRK is better at correcting near-sightedness. We judged the evidence for most outcomes as very low to moderate quality because of variation in reporting and differences in effects among trials.
We wanted to know if remdesivir is an effective treatment for people with COVID-19 and if it causes unwanted effects compared to placebo or usual care. Its effect could depend on how advanced the illness is when treatment begins. We therefore distinguished between hospitalised patients with moderate to severe disease (e.g. having ventilation) and non-hospitalised people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but have no or mild symptoms.
We were interested in the following outcomes for hospitalised patients:
• deaths in the 28 days after treatment or after more than 28 days, if available;
• deaths that occurred during hospitalisation;
• whether patients got better after treatment and were ready to be discharged;
• whether patients’ condition worsened so that they needed mechanical ventilation through a breathing tube or died;
• any unwanted effects; and
• serious unwanted effects.
We were interested in the following outcomes for non-hospitalised patients:
• deaths in the 28 days after treatment or after more than 28 days, if available;
• whether patients got better after treatment so that they were free of symptoms;
• whether patients’ condition worsened so that they needed to be hospitalised or that they died;
• quality of life;
• any unwanted effects; and
• serious unwanted effects. We searched for studies that investigated remdesivir to treat adults with COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard care. Patients could be of any gender or ethnicity.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found eight studies with 10,656 people hospitalised with moderate to severe COVID-19 and one study with 562 people with mild COVID-19. Of these, 5982 people were given remdesivir. No studies evaluated people without symptoms of COVID-19. The average age of patients was 59 years. The included studies compared remdesivir and usual care to usual care (plus/minus placebo) in people with COVID-19. Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to deaths after 28 days, after 60 days, or to deaths in hospital during 150 days. It probably raises the chance for patients to get better slightly, and it probably lowers the risk of getting worse. The rates of unwanted effects of any severity were similar between the compared groups. In the study with outpatients no one died during the investigation (28 days). After treatment with remdesivir, people were less likely to get worse and be hospitalised. We do not know whether remdesivir leads to more or less chance for patients to improve. Patients may suffer fewer serious unwanted effects with remdesivir than with placebo or standard care. The rates of unwanted effects of any severity were similar between the compared groups. We are moderately confident in the evidence for deaths and course of disease in hospitalised people. Our confidence in the evidence of all other results in this group is limited because of differences between studies and a possible influence of their methods. For non-hospitalised people with mild COVID-19, we are moderately confident in the evidence for worsening of patients' condition and unwanted effects. Our confidence in the evidence of all other results is limited, especially for improvement of patients' condition, for methodological reasons (e.g. measurements were carried out inadequately or are not comparable, or both) and different results between studies. The studies were conducted at a time when vaccine programmes had not been started and the virus differed from subsequent strains. Most of the people in the studies also live in high- and middle-income countries. This might limit the applicability of the findings to people who are vaccinated and in low-income countries with less access to medical care. This is an update of the initial review and the evidence is current to 31 May 2022.
For most of the other comparisons, there was only low or very low quality evidence, which was based on the results of only two or three small trials. There were only a few studies which provided information on the effect of behavioural treatment on functional disability or return to work.
Further research is very likely to have an important impact on the results and our confidence in them.
We included five trials of three e-health interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web-MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), undertaken with children aged 10 to 18 years old. Although some of these interventions were acceptable to users, none of them were clearly any better than a selected range of other therapies or waiting list at reducing symptoms of anxiety or depression.The very low quality of the evidence means the effects of e-health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. The review authors rated the overall risk of bias in the trials as high or uncertain. Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective e-health interventions to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions.
We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm infants (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy), low-birth-weight (weighing less than 2500 g) infants, or preterm and low-birth-weight infants with a PDA. The treatments were ibuprofen, indomethacin, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, placebo or no treatment. The evidence is current to 30 November 2017. This review of 39 trials (2843 infants) found that ibuprofen was as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA, caused fewer transient side effects on the kidneys, and reduced the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, a serious condition that affects the gut. Whether ibuprofen confers any important long-term advantages or disadvantages on development is not known. Additional long-term follow-up studies to 18 months of age and to the age of school entry are needed to decide whether ibuprofen or indomethacin is the drug of choice for closing a PDA. According to GRADE (a method to score the quality of the trials supporting each outcome), the quality of the evidence varied from very low to moderate but was moderate for the important outcomes of failure to close a PDA, need for surgical closure of the PDA, duration of ventilator support, necrotizing enterocolitis, oliguria and serum/plasma creatinine levels when we compared intravenous or oral ibuprofen with intravenous or oral indomethacin.
This is an update of a review published in 2003 and previously updated in 2009 and 2012. For this latest update, the search was rerun on 17 October 2013, and no new studies were found. Rheumatic fever is a late complication of a type of throat infection caused by streptococcal bacteria. It is an immune system disease that can lead to inflammatory disease of the heart (carditis), joints, brain and skin. Carditis can cause heart failure and death. Various anti-inflammatory drugs have been used to treat carditis, including corticosteroids, aspirin and immunoglobulins (immune therapy using antibodies). No new trials were identified in this update. This review includes eight trials with 996 participants. Evidence shows little effect of corticosteroids over aspirin in preventing cardiac disease after one year (six studies, 907 participants, risk ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.15). Several steroidal agents such as corticotrophin, cortisone, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone were compared with aspirin before 1966, and prednisone and immunoglobulins were compared with placebo in studies from 1990 and 2001, respectively. Most studies did not report on adverse events, but those that did reported complications due to corticosteroids including weight gain, enlarged facial features and acne. Trials were generally old (six of the eight trials were conducted between 1955 and 1965), small and of poor quality and had high risk of bias. For this reason, results should be interpreted with caution.
The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of supportive therapy compared to other specific therapies or treatment as usual. This update is based on a search run in 2012; the review now includes 24 randomised studies with a total of 2126 people. The studies compared supportive therapy either with standard care alone or a range of other therapies such as CBT, family therapy and psychoeducation. The participants continued to receive their antipsychotic medication and any other treatment they would normally receive during the trials. Overall, the quality of evidence from these studies was very low. There is not enough information or data to identify any real therapeutic difference between supportive therapy and standard care. There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation, satisfaction with treatment and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy. However, these findings are limited because they are based on only a few small studies where the quality of evidence is very low. There was very limited information to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation as most studies in this review focused on other psychological therapies, such as CBT. Apart from one study presenting data on death, there was no information on the adverse effects of supportive therapy. In summary, there does not seem to be much difference between supportive therapy, standard care and other therapies. Future research would benefit from larger studies where supportive therapy is the main treatment.

Limited evidence from one randomised controlled trial indicated that surgery involving cutting the relevant nerve and implanting it into a muscle tendon may yield better long-term results than standard surgical removal of the nerve. There is little evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of insoles. There were no randomised controlled trials reporting the effect of corticosteroid injections. Adverse events following surgery were common. Well-designed trials are needed to guide clinical practice.
Although complex laboratory studies show that ion generators alter airways function, the few studies which have been conducted in the homes of people with asthma, demonstrate no significant benefit in improving lung function or symptoms.
We identified two clinical trials that included a limited number of patients comparing ruxolitinib to placebo or standard medical treatment. Both studies were published in 2012, and were conducted in the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK). Drug companies sponsored both trials. Although the results of the studies only showed a moderate improvement of patients treated with ruxolitinib in terms of their quality of life and a reduction in their spleen size, we could not be sure whether these effects were reliable because of the limitations of the studies and the low number of people they recruited. We also could not be sure whether the drug has an effect on overall survival compared with a placebo, or when it was compared with an active treatment. The effect of ruxolitinib in terms of progression-free survival was also uncertain. In addition, people treated with this drug showed higher rates of anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia compared with patients treated with a placebo, but the rate of adverse effects was similar to those treated with a medical treatment. The confidence in the results of this review is very low. The studies have limitations in the way they were designed and executed. Moreover, the limited number of patients included in the studies led to imprecise results. Larger studies should provide more information about the effect of ruxolitinib.
Researchers from Cochrane searched all available literature up to 13 November 2014.
The review found that few trials have been performed to investigate its effectiveness. There is currently not enough evidence that adding chemotherapy to other treatments helps to treat the recurring cancer or to improve survival. However, chemotherapy may be an option, and further trials are underway.
Despite a thorough search of the available literature we were not able to identify any study of good quality investigating the relationship between weight reduction and the occurrence of strokes. If overweight or obese people want to reduce their risk profile by losing weight they need sound evidence for doing so since every intervention might have negative consequences as well, for example losing and regaining weight ("weight cycling") is associated with health hazards like cardiovascular diseases. There is an urgent need for adequate research (good randomised controlled clinical trials) hopefully providing better advice in the future.
Our searches are current to May 2015. We found no new trials. In previous searches, we found seven randomised controlled trials that used beta2-agonist drugs for people with acute bronchitis. Two trials studied children aged one to 10 years (134 participants) and five were conducted in adults (418 participants). None of the studies reported receiving grants from drug-making companies to conduct the study, but people who work for a drug maker were listed as authors on reports from two trials and study drugs were supplied free of charge by the company in three trials. Daily cough scores were no different between children given oral beta2-agonists and children in the placebo control groups. Daily cough scores, or the number of people still coughing after seven days, did not change in the adult trials either.
However, the results were mixed. Some trials show a benefit and some show no benefit. This may be because some participants also had wheezing or other signs of narrowed airways, in which case beta2-agonists may be helpful only for them. More of the adults taking beta2-agonists had tremor, shakiness or nervousness. We rated this as low or moderate. There were few trials, with small numbers of people with acute bronchitis or cough. The trials were of short duration (three to seven days) and only two used inhaled beta2-agonists, which is now the usual way the drug is taken by adults and older children. Some important information about how the trial was done was not mentioned in the papers giving results for many of the trials.
Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. Interpretation of the results was hindered by the small total sample size and by the low quality of reporting of the included trials. There was some evidence that haloperidol was more efficacious than placebo in terms of reduction of manic and psychotic symptom scores, when used both as monotherapy and as add-on treatment to lithium or valproate. There is no evidence of difference in efficacy between haloperidol and risperidone, olanzapine, valproate, carbamazepine, sultopride and zuclopentixol. There was a statistically significant difference with haloperidol being probably less effective than aripiprazole. No comparative efficacy data with quetiapine, lithium or chlorpromazine were reported. Haloperidol caused more extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) than placebo and more movement disorders and EPS but less weight gain than olanzapine. Haloperidol caused more EPS than valproate but no difference was found between haloperidol and lithium, carbamazepine, sultopride and risperidone in terms of side effects profile.
People who are addicted to opioids have high risks of receiving an overdose of opioid, HIV, hepatitis B and C infections and criminal activity. This has led to a harm reduction treatment approach to drug addiction. Treatment is aimed at a reduction in these risks and relapses to opioid and polysubstance use and promoting psychosocial adjustment. Methadone maintenance treatment is a long-term opioid replacement therapy that is used to manage opioid dependence, reduce illicit opioid use and promote retention in treatment. Taken by mouth and active over 24 to 36 hours, it is an opioid drug that removes the euphoric effects of heroin and reduces withdrawal symptoms as well as being compatible with normal activities at work or school. The review authors identified 21 controlled trials involving a total of 5994 opioid users. In 11 of these trials, all from the USA, 2279 participants were randomised to methadone treatment at different doses or another treatment (buprenorphine or levomethadyl). Treatment was for between seven and 53 weeks. A further 10 controlled trials did not randomly assign the total of 3715 participants to a treatment. These were from various diverse countries and followed opioid users for one to 10 years. Higher doses of methadone (60 to 100 mg/day) were more effective than lower doses (1 to 39 mg/day) in retaining opioid users in therapy and in reducing illicit use of heroin and cocaine during treatment. Side effects of methadone appeared to be similar at the different doses, in one trial only. 
The organisation and regulation of methadone maintenance treatment varies widely and some countries have explicit guidelines for programme operation. Methadone maintenance treatment involves the prescription of a drug which itself causes dependence. This means that treatment is not naturally aimed at the total recovery of the individual.
We wanted to find out how effective international travel-related control measures are in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched for studies on the effects of these measures on the spread of COVID-19. Studies had to report how many cases these measures prevented or detected, or whether they changed the course of the pandemic. The studies could include people of any age, anywhere. They could be of any design including those that used ‘real-life’ data (observational studies) or hypothetical data from computer-generated simulations (modelling studies).
This is the first update of our review. This update includes only studies on COVID-19, published up to 13 November 2020. We found 62 studies. Most (49 studies) were modelling studies; only 13 used real-life data (observational studies). Studies took place across the world and at different times during the pandemic. Levels of COVID-19 within countries varied.
Most studies compared current travel-related control measures with no travel-related controls. However, some modelling studies also compared current measures against possible measures, for example, to see what might happen if controls were more or less relaxed or were combined with other measures. Below we summarise the findings of some outcomes. (31 modelling studies)
Most studies showed that travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel were beneficial, but this beneficial effect ranged from small to large. Additionally, some studies found no effect. Studies also predicted that these restrictions would delay the outbreak, but the delay ranged from one day to 85 days in different studies. (13 modelling studies and 13 observational studies)
These studies assessed screening at borders, including screening people with symptoms or who had potentially been exposed to COVID-19, or testing people, before or after they travelled.
For screening based on symptoms or potential exposure to COVID-19, modelling studies found that screening reduced imported or exported cases and delayed outbreaks. Modelling studies predicted that 1% to 53% of cases would be detected. Observational studies reported a wide range of cases detected, from 0% to 100%, with the majority of studies reporting less than 54% of cases detected.
For screening based on testing, studies reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases, and cases detected. Observational studies reported that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90%. This variation might be due to the timing of testing. (12 modelling studies)
All studies suggested that quarantine may be beneficial, but the size of this effect ranged from small to large in the different studies. Modelling studies, for example, predicted that quarantine could lead to between 450 and over 64,000 fewer cases in the community. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how well they followed the rules. (7 modelling studies and 4 observational studies)
For quarantine and screening at borders, most studies suggested some benefit, however the size of this effect differed between studies. For example, observational studies reported that between 68% and 92% of cases would be detected. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how often they were tested while in quarantine. Our confidence in these results is limited. Most studies were based on mathematical predictions (modelling), so we lack real-life evidence. Further, we were not confident that models used correct assumptions, so our confidence in the evidence on travel restrictions and quarantine, in particular, is very low. Some studies were published quickly online as ‘preprints’. Preprints do not undergo the normal rigorous checks of published studies, so we are not certain how reliable they are. Also, the studies were very different from each other and their results varied according to the specification of each travel measure (e.g. the type of screening approach), how it was put into practice and enforced, the amount of cross-border travel, levels of community transmission and other types of national measures to control the pandemic. Overall, international travel-related control measures may help to limit the spread of COVID-19 across national borders. Restricting cross-border travel can be a helpful measure. Screening travellers only for symptoms at borders is likely to miss many cases; testing may be more effective but may also miss cases if only performed upon arrival. Quarantine that lasts at least 10 days can prevent travellers spreading COVID-19 and may be more effective if combined with another measure such as testing, especially if people follow the rules.
Future research needs to be better reported. More studies should focus on real-life evidence, and should assess potential benefits and risks of travel-related control measures to individuals and society as a whole.
The quality of the evidence that compared oral progestogens (short and long course) to other medical treatments for HMB was either low or very low which means that we are very uncertain of the findings of the review. The main limitations were risk of bias (women and researchers were aware of the treatment they were receiving which was likely to interfere with the responses, and there was a high number of dropouts from studies) and inconsistency (the results varied among studies).
This is an update of a review previously published in 2006, 2012 and 2015, and includes results of a search for new studies in January 2019. We found 59 studies testing various antiarrhythmic drugs and involving 20,981 participants. The average age of participants was 65 years. The most frequent diseases were hypertension (high blood pressure) and diseases of the arteries and valves of the heart. We found studies for nine medicines: quinidine, disopyramide, propafenone, flecainide, metoprolol, amiodarone, dofetilide, dronedarone and sotalol. High-certainty evidence from five studies found that deaths from any cause were twice as high in people taking sotalol compared with people taking a placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment. We calculated that one extra person would die for every 102 people taking sotalol for one year. Evidence for quinidine was low certainty, but the average effect across six studies suggested that people who took quinidine may have a higher risk of death compared with people taking no treatment or placebo. However, the evidence was not strong enough to rule out the possibility that there was no increased risk of death with quinidine. We found few data on mortality for disopyramide, flecainide and propafenone, meaning that we are uncertain of the effect of these drugs on mortality. We found no clear evidence that the other medicines we studied had any effect on risk of death.
We found that people taking any of these medicines were more likely to stop taking them due to side effects, compared with people not taking them. We are less certain of the results for disopyramide, amiodarone, dofetilide and flecainide because the low-certainty evidence mostly came from small studies with design limitations. Evidence was moderate or high for the other medicines.
One particular side effect of antiarrhythmic medications is proarrhythmia, which means that people have new or more frequent problems with irregular heartbeats. We found high-certainty evidence that people taking quinidine or metoprolol had a higher risk of proarrhythmia than people taking no treatment or placebo. Moderate-certainty evidence indicated a similar increased risk for flecainide, amiodarone, dofetilide, dronedarone and sotalol. Evidence from these studies was moderate certainty due to problems with study limitations, smaller size or imprecise results. We are uncertain of the effect of propafenone on proarrhythmia as we only had very low-certainty evidence for this medicine. None of the disopyramide studies reported how many people had proarrhythmia.
We found high-certainty evidence that dronedarone may reduce the risk of stroke. There was no evidence of an effect of sotalol (moderate-certainty evidence); amiodarone, flecainide, quinidine (all low-certainty evidence) or disopyramide (very low-certainty evidence) on risk of stroke. No studies reported risk of stroke with propafenone, metoprolol or dofetilide.
Moderate- to high-certainty evidence, except disopyramide which was low certainty, showed that all the medicines we assessed reduced recurrence of atrial fibrillation, compared with not taking any treatment or taking a placebo. However, atrial fibrillation still recurred in about half of participants (43% to 67%) treated with antiarrhythmics.
Overall, It is unclear whether long-term treatment with antiarrhythmic medicines carries benefits that outweigh their risks for this group of people.
The tocolytic drugs, atosiban and barusiban, were the only ORAs we found that had been studied in trials; some trials compared with no treatment and others compared atosiban with betamimetics (another group of tocolytic drugs). We identified 14 studies, involving 2485 women. We found that, although atosiban resulted in fewer maternal side effects than other tocolytic drugs (especially betamimetics), atosiban was not effective in delaying or preventing preterm birth or improving neonatal outcome, and may possibly contribute to poorer infant outcomes. Further well-designed studies would be helpful, especially in women with threatened preterm at low gestations where preterm birth puts babies at particularly high risk of death or disability.
Atosiban is no better than placebo or other drugs in delaying or preventing preterm birth but it has fewer maternal side effects compared to other tocolytics.
There are studies suggesting that bezafibrate, alone or in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid, is effective in treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. Mechanisms through which bezafibrate improves lipid serum concentration balance and prevents biliary cell damage still need to be fully understood. This review evaluates all data on the benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in randomised clinical trials. The findings of this review are based on six randomised clinical trials with 151 Japanese patients. Bezafibrate was compared with no intervention in four trials (with co-intervention of ursodeoxycholic acid in both the bezafibrate and control groups) and with ursodeoxycholic acid in two trials. The primary findings of the review are that bezafibrate has no statistically significant effects on mortality, liver-related morbidity, adverse events, and quality of life of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. A possible positive intervention effect of bezafibrate versus no intervention on liver biochemistry measures can be real but could also be due to systematic errors or random errors. The benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis need further assessment in randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate with placebo. Such trials ought to be conducted with impeccable methodology to reduce the risks of random errors and sufficiently large patient groups to reduce the risks of random errors.
Early studies suggested a beneficial effect of ALC on cognition and behaviour in aging subjects. However, later, larger studies have not supported these findings. The early and later studies differ widely in methodology and assessment tools used, and are therefore difficult to compare. There is no evidence of benefit of ALC in the areas of cognition, severity of dementia, functional ability or Clinical Global Impression as a continuous measure. An apparent beneficial effect on Clinical Global Impression assessed as a dichotomous variable may be due to chance. There was also a significant treatment effect on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 24 weeks, but this result must be interpreted with caution in the context of significant heterogeneity in these trials. ALC is not currently in routine clinical use.
We wanted to know how well sucrose worked to relieve pain in newborn babies who are having heel lance procedures while they were in hospital. We also wanted to know whether there were any safety concerns about using sucrose to relieve pain from single painful events such as heel lance. We searched for studies that investigated:
- Sucrose compared to no treatment or standard care;
- Sucrose compared to water, other sweet solutions (e.g. glucose);
- Sucrose compared to another nondrug intervention (e.g. NNS);
- Whether sucrose was effective in decreasing the amount and severity of pain that babies experienced as assessed by baby’s pain responses (e.g. crying, grimacing, heart rate) and by using standardised infant pain scales.
We also wanted to know if sucrose was associated with any unwanted effects in preterm or term babies.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods. We reviewed 55 studies that included a total of 6273 babies. Twenty-nine studies had full-term babies only, 22 had preterm babies only, and four had both full-term and preterm babies. Heel lance was the painful procedure in 50 studies. Five studies investigated a variety of other minor painful procedures in addition to heel lancing. - Sucrose compared to the control treatment probably reduces pain from single heel lances in babies.
- Results are uncertain about the effect of sucrose compared to NNS, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, and facilitated tucking, in reducing pain scores.
- Results are uncertain about the effect of sucrose + NNS compared to NNS, in reducing pain.
- Sucrose does not seem to reduce pain from single heel lances compared to glucose, expressed breast milk, and skin-to-skin care.
- Reported adverse events were minor and resolved without any intervention. We have moderate-certainty evidence that sucrose likely reduces pain from heel lance. This evidence is up-to-date as of February 2022. We did not identify any studies that received funding from industry.
We included four studies; three compared the two approaches to resuscitation when given by untrained bystanders under instruction by telephone. One study compared the two approaches when given by EMS personnel.
The three studies, comparing the approaches given by untrained bystanders, (3737 participants) were all undertaken in urban areas and some included both children and adult OHCA. The, bystanders were all untrained and given telephone instructions from the emergency services.
The fourth study compared approaches given by EMS professionals (23,711 participants); it was undertaken in urban areas and included only adult OHCA. When CPR was performed by bystanders, we found that more people survived until discharge from hospital after chest compression alone than they did following interrupted chest compression with pauses at a fixed ratio for rescue breathing (15 compressions to 2 breaths) (14% versus 11.6%). For the outcomes of survival to hospital admission and neurological outcomes, we did not have sufficient data to be certain that either strategy was better. No data was available for adverse effects, quality of life or survival at one-year.
When CPR was performed by EMS professionals, we found that survival to hospital discharge was slightly lower with continuous chest compressions (100/minute) plus asynchronous rescue breathing (10/minutes) CPR compared with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing. Around 9.7% of people lived when they received interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing compared with 9% of people who received continuous chest compression plus asynchronous rescue breathing.
The number of people who survived to hospital admission was slightly higher in those treated with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing compared with continuous chest compression plus asynchronous rescue breathing (25.9% versus 24.6%). There was little or no difference in neurological outcomes. The proportion of people who experienced adverse events was probably similar with 55.4% people treated with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing experiencing an adverse event compared with 54.4% in those treated with continuous chest compression asynchronous rescue breathing. For bystander-provided CPR, the quality of the evidence was high for the outcome of survival to hospital discharge. For survival to hospital admission, one trial provided results and the evidence was of moderate-quality because of low numbers of people for whom data were available. This was also the case for neurological outcomes.
In the one EMS professional-provided CPR trial, the quality of the evidence was moderate for the outcome of survival to hospital discharge because the results do not exclude there being little or no difference between the two approaches, and this is also the case for adverse events. For survival to hospital admission there was high-quality evidence.
The main limitation of the current evidence is that only a few trials have been undertaken, and for some outcomes, not enough data have been generated.
A total of 28 randomised controlled trials were included, with a total of 1273 menopausal women. Over 95% of the study populations were postmenopausal women. Women's ages ranged from 36 to 80 years. Treatment duration varied from one week to one year. In more than 80% of the trials DHEA was administered orally with the daily doses varying between 10 mg and 1600 mg. We found no evidence that DHEA improves quality of life. There was some evidence that it was associated with androgenic side effects (for example acne, unwanted hair growth (hirsutism)). It was uncertain whether DHEA decreased menopausal symptoms, but DHEA may have slightly improved sexual function. The quality of the evidence was moderate for both quality of life and side effects. We downgraded the quality of evidence based on the lack of data on randomisation, allocation, or blinding; small study sizes overall; and limited data available.
The evidence is current to August 2014. One study was included in this review. In total, data from five children, with uncontrolled seizures, aged between one and 11 years old were assessed. The duration of this study was two months; one month for the corticosteroid treatment and one month for the placebo (inactive) treatment. One of the five children was withdrawn from the study and another had epileptic spasms which meant we could not include their data in our analysis. Therefore, we were only able to compare data for three children. All three received both of the study treatments and the frequency of seizures they experienced while taking each treatment was compared.
Key results
One child showed a 25% to 50% reduction in seizure frequency whilst being treated with low dose corticosteroids compared to the placebo treatment. This child plus another child both showed a 25% to 50% reduction in seizure frequency whilst being treated with the higher dose of corticosteroids compared to the placebo treatment. A third child showed no reduction in seizures with either of the doses. As only one study was found which included data from three out of five participants, further statistical analysis was not possible. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the role of corticosteroids in children with epilepsy.
Quality of evidence
The evidence from the one study included in this review was rated as low quality due to the small sample size. There is a need for larger, well-designed studies.
Decisions about whether to participate in randomized trials are made more difficult because of the widespread belief that new treatments must inevitably be superior to existing (standard) treatments. Indeed, it is understandable that people hope that this will be the case. If this was actually so, however, the ethical precondition of uncertainty would often not apply. This Cochrane methodology review addresses this important question: "What is the likelihood that new treatments being compared to established treatments in randomized trials will be shown to be superior? " Four cohorts of consecutive, publicly funded, randomized trials, which altogether included 743 trials that enrolled 297,744 patients, met our inclusion criteria for this review. We found that, on average, new treatments were very slightly more likely to have favorable results than established treatments, both in terms of the primary outcomes targeted and overall survival. In other words, when new treatments are compared with established treatments in randomized trials we can expect slightly more than half will prove to be better, and slightly less than half will prove to be worse than established treatments. This conclusion applies to publicly funded trials as we did not include studies funded by commercial sponsors in our analysis. The results are consistent with the ethical preconditions for random allocation – when people are enrolled in randomized trials, the results cannot be predicted in advance as there is genuine uncertainty about which of the treatments being compared in randomized trials will prove to be superior.
The review included five studies with a total of 386 people with sickle cell disease aged between four and 53 years. Two studies (306 people) compared intravenous magnesium to a placebo (in this case saline (salty water)) in people admitted to hospital as an emergency because of pain and lasted until they were discharged (less than four weeks). Two of the three longer-term studies compared oral magnesium pidolate with placebo and the third study compared hydroxyurea and magnesium pidolate to each other and to placebo but we have only included the results of the comparison of magnesium pidolate to placebo). Not all the studies reported on our outcomes and we could not analyse data from most of the studies. We did find that in the people admitted to hospital as emergency cases, intravenous magnesium did not reduce pain levels, could not shorten the length of time spent in hospital and did not improve their quality of life compared to placebo. However, more people given magnesium experienced warmth where the needle was inserted than those people who were given placebo.
Oral magnesium pidolate, given over a longer period, did not reduce the severity of painful episodes and had no measurable effect on properties of sickled red cells (e.g. magnesium levels in the blood). Oral magnesium appeared to be safe and well-tolerated with only mild side effects (diarrhoea and headache). Further research is needed to compare the short-term and long-term benefits of magnesium treatment and its side effects. The quality of evidence for intravenous magnesium and oral magnesium in treating sickle cell disease was moderate for pain when using short-term intravenous magnesium and for levels of magnesium in the blood when taking longer-term oral magnesium supplements. The quality of evidence was low for all other outcomes we measured. All of the included studies of oral or intravenous magnesium for treating sickle cell disease had some aspects that could undermine the reliability of their results. Therefore, we have some uncertainty of these findings and further research may provide evidence that could change our conclusions.
We wanted to find out if there are differences between cardiovascular training and resistance training for the treatment and prevention of fatigue caused by cancer, well-being (also known as quality of life), and unwanted effects. Cardiovascular training involves exercise such as walking, running, swimming, and cycling, whereas resistance training includes exercise using one's own bodyweight, weights, or elastic therapy bands. We searched for studies that compared cardiovascular training and resistance training in people with any type of cancer. Training could have been started before, during, or after cancer treatment.
We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found six studies that involved 447 people with breast cancer, prostate cancer (a small gland in the pelvis that is part of the male reproductive system), or lung cancer. These studies did not report if people already had fatigue caused by cancer before starting to exercise. People in these studies were treated with chemotherapy (medicines to kill the cancer), radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer to reduce or kill it), surgery (to remove the cancer), or a combination of these. The cardiovascular or resistance training started during or after cancer treatment. Most studies looked at short-term results (up to and including 12 weeks of monitoring), only one study had long-term results (six months or longer of monitoring). Studies were supported by research grants and took place in Canada, Belgium, the USA, and Germany.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular and resistance training on fatigue caused by cancer, well-being, and unwanted effects in the short or long term. Our confidence in the evidence is very low. We found only a few studies including low numbers of people. We also found problems in the methods of the studies. For example, people in the studies knew which training they received. This could have influenced the results. The evidence is up to date to October 2023.
We identified three studies. Two studies tested modafinil, and one study tested clarithromycin.
The two studies testing modafinil included a total of 102 people with idiopathic hypersomnia. Most of these people slept fewer than 10 hours per night. Both studies included people from multiple sleep clinics. One study took place in Germany, and the other in Japan. Both studies compared modafinil to placebo, lasted for three weeks, and were funded by pharmaceutical companies with commercial interest in the results of the studies.
The study testing clarithromycin included a total of 20 participants, from a single sleep clinic in the USA, 10 of whom had idiopathic hypersomnia. We only included information for the 10 people with idiopathic hypersomnia in the review. This study compared clarithromycin to placebo. Although the study lasted five weeks, we only included information from the first two weeks. This study was funded by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Foundation, a charitable organization. Modafinil improves sleepiness and the ability to stay awake during testing in a sleep laboratory. It probably improves the overall severity of idiopathic hypersomnia, feelings of exhaustion, and daytime performance. Modafinil may cause headaches and stomach symptoms such as nausea.
It is uncertain whether or not clarithromycin helps with daytime sleepiness or other symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia. It is uncertain whether there is a difference in side effects between clarithromycin and placebo, based on the information included in this review. We judged the overall quality of the evidence in the three studies as ranging from high to low, depending on the outcome and drug being studied. All three studies were well-conducted. The studies were small. We found very few studies testing medication treatments for idiopathic hypersomnia. More studies are needed before we can be certain which medications are best for treating people with idiopathic hypersomnia.
The authors found 56 studies; the overall findings show that school-based secondary prevention programmes aimed at reducing aggressive behaviour do appear to produce improvements in behaviour. The improvements can be achieved in both primary and secondary school age groups and in both mixed sex groups and boy-only groups.
Further research is needed to investigate if the apparent beneficial programmes effects can be realised outside the experimental setting and in settings other than schools. None of the studies collected data on violent injury, so we can not be certain of the extent to which an improvement in behaviour translates to an actual injury reduction. In addition, more research is needed to determine if the beneficial effects can be maintained over time, and if the benefits can be justified against the costs of implementing such programmes.
This review looked for randomized trials comparing Huperzine A with control in patients with AD. Six trials were identified but most trials were of low methodological quality. Although Huperzine A seemed to have some beneficial effects on improvement of general cognitive function, global clinical status, behavioral disturbance and functional performance for patients with AD, the small trials with limited numbers of patients and the low methodological quality resulted in cautious assessment of the results. More large, high-quality randomized trials are needed.
We wanted to find out if non-medical interventions are better than usual care to improve getting back to work. We also wanted to find out if those interventions led to better quality of life. We considered four types of intervention:
– psycho-educational interventions (people with cancer learnt about physical side effects, stress and coping, and they took part in group discussions);
– vocational interventions (aimed at work-related issues);
– physical interventions (people with cancer took part in physical exercises such as walking); and
– multidisciplinary interventions (vocational counselling, patient education, patient counselling, physical exercises or combinations of these). We searched for studies that looked at interventions aimed at improving getting people with cancer back to paid employment (employee or self-employed). We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and study size. We found 15 studies that involved 1477 people with cancer that measured getting back to work. All studies were conducted in high-income countries. Nine studies were aimed at people with breast cancer and two studies at men with prostate cancer.
– Psycho-educational interventions probably result in little to no difference in getting back to work or quality of life.
– Physical interventions and multidisciplinary interventions likely lead to more people with cancer getting back to work than when they received care as usual. A physical intervention will probably help 50 to 244 per 1000 people returning to work on top of the average of 627 per 1000 people who return to work without intervention. A multidisciplinary intervention will probably help 69 to 219 people per 1000 more return to work. They may result in little to no difference in quality of life.
– We are uncertain about the effects of vocational interventions on getting people back to work. We are moderately confident that physical and multidisciplinary interventions likely increase the number of people with cancer getting back to work. Our confidence was reduced because some studies did not clearly report how they were conducted. We have little confidence in the evidence about psycho-educational interventions, and we have no confidence in the evidence about vocational interventions. The main reasons for reducing our confidence were that studies used methods that were likely to introduce errors in their results, and we found only one very small study on vocational interventions. Further research could change the results of this review. The evidence is up to date to August 2021.
This review analysed the role of narrow band imaging colonoscopy compared to the white light colonoscopy for detection of colorectal polyps. In total eight randomised trials with 3673 participants were able to provide data for our analyses. Narrow band imaging colonoscopy was not better than high definition white light colonoscopy for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps. We found weak evidence that narrow band imaging colonoscopy could be better than conventional white light colonoscopy for detection of patients with colorectal polyps.
Review authors rated the quality of evidence from most included studies as very low or low, and the effects described below should be interpreted with caution.
Acupuncture may result in a moderate reduction in the severity of depression when compared with treatment as usual/no treatment. Use of acupuncture may lead to a small reduction in the severity of depression when compared with control acupuncture. Effects of acupuncture versus medication and psychological therapy are uncertain owing to the very low quality of evidence. Risks of adverse events with acupuncture are also unclear, as most trials have not reported on adverse events. Review authors recommend that additional high-quality randomised controlled trials should be undertaken. These trials should use suitable blinding (by which people do not know which treatment they are receiving) when appropriate and should incorporate quality of life measures, assessment of treatment acceptability, and medium- and long-term follow-up.
We included randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in people with acute bronchitis or acute productive cough and no underlying chronic lung condition. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants. Co-treatments with other medications to relieve symptoms were allowed if they were given to all participants in the study. Our evidence is current to 13 January, 2017.
We found limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis. Some people treated with antibiotics recovered a bit more quickly with reduced cough-related outcomes. However, this difference may not be of practical importance as it amounted to a difference of half a day over an 8- to 10-day period. There was a small but significant increase in adverse side effects in people treated with antibiotics. The most commonly reported side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, and rash.
This review suggests that there is limited benefit to the patient in using antibiotics for acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy individuals. More research is needed on the effects of using antibiotics for acute bronchitis in frail, elderly people with multiple chronic conditions who may not have been included in the existing trials. Antibiotic use needs to be considered in the context of the potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting condition, cost of antibiotic treatment, and in particular associated population-level harms due to increasing antibiotic resistance. The quality of these trials was generally good, particularly for more recent studies.
Four studies including 9130 adults and adolescents were included. None of the studies included children younger than age 12. The studies lasted for six months to a year, and all were funded by one drug company. Studies included more women than men, with average age of about 40. Three studies recruited people with quite similar symptoms, but one study included people with less severe asthma. The studies were well conducted, although two did not hide which treatments were being taken (known as blinding), which might have affected the results. The amount of inhaled steroids, including puffs taken for relief from symptoms, was consistently lower for SiT than for the comparison groups using two types of inhalers. Overall, we believe that the quality of the evidence was high to moderate. Fewer people taking SiT had flare-ups that needed a hospital stay or a visit to the ER (one fewer per 100 treated than in the control group, 95% CI 0 to 2 fewer) or a course of oral steroids (two fewer per 100 treated, 95% CI one to three fewer). If more studies are published, it is unlikely that our opinions on these main findings will change. However, we could not tell whether one treatment caused more serious adverse events than the other. SiT had a small benefit on one measure of lung function (predose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)). However, for several other measures, not enough information was available to show which treatment was better (amount of medication taken on an 'as needed' basis, various symptom measures and quality of life).
In conclusion, SiT reduces the need for a hospital stay or an ER visit and for courses of oral steroids for asthma flare-ups. SiT did not increase the quantity of inhaled steroids taken overall, and it was unclear whether it increases or decreases serious side effects. Currently no data are available for the use of SiT in children younger than age 12.
We included seven Cochrane Reviews and one protocol (plan) for a Cochrane Review. Two reviews included studies outside our area of interest; for example, they focused on babies born normally at the end of the pregnancy, or babies not needing breathing machines. The other five reviews investigated these medicines: paracetamol (3 studies), midazolam (3 studies), phenobarbital (9 studies), opioids (20 studies), and ibuprofen (5 studies). • Less severe brain bleeding
We are moderately confident in the evidence for ibuprofen, which likely results in no important difference in the amount of brain bleeding compared to placebo (an inactive or 'dummy' medicine) (ranging from 19% reduction to 21% increase). We are not confident in the evidence for: morphine compared to diamorphine; other medicines compared to placebo. None of the studies investigating other comparisons between two different medicines looked at this outcome.
• Severe brain bleeding
We are not confident in the evidence for paracetamol, phenobarbital, opioids, and ibuprofen compared to placebo. Similarly, we are not confident in the evidence for: paracetamol compared to ibuprofen; morphine compared to midazolam and fentanyl. No studies on midazolam compared to placebo and morphine to diamorphine reported severe brain bleeding.
• Deaths (from any cause) at 28 days of life
We are moderately confident in the evidence for opioids, which likely results in no important difference compared to placebo (ranging from 20% reduction to 55% increase). We are not confident in the evidence for: phenobarbital and ibuprofen compared to placebo; morphine compared to midazolam and diamorphine. No studies on paracetamol and midazolam compared to placebo, paracetamol to ibuprofen, and morphine to fentanyl reported deaths (from any cause) at 28 days of life.
• Long-term development
We are not confident in the evidence for opioids compared to placebo on babies' long-term development at 18 to 24 months old and at five to six years old. None of the other studies looked at long-term development.
We identified one Cochrane Review protocol on dexmedetomidine, a medicine to manage pain and help babies relax. We plan to include evidence from this review when it is published. We are moderately confident in the evidence for ibuprofen on less severe brain bleeding and opioids on deaths (from any cause) compared to placebo. We are not confident in the evidence for the other comparisons and outcomes. The studies either did not report information that we could use or produced findings in which we have very little confidence. These studies were small and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.
We included six studies, which comprised two prevention trials (a total of 327 young to middle-aged adults in Russia) and four treatment trials (a total of 1196 teenagers and adults in France and Germany). The findings from the two prevention trials did not show that Oscillococcinum®can prevent the onset of flu. Although the results from the four other clinical trials suggested that Oscillococcinum®relieved flu symptoms at 48 hours, this might be due to bias in the trial methods. One patient reported headache after taking Oscillococcinum®. The evidence is current to September 2014. The overall standard of research reporting was poor, and thus many aspects of the trials' methods and results were at unclear risk of bias. We therefore judged the evidence overall as low quality, preventing clear conclusions from being made about Oscillococcinum®in the prevention or treatment of flu and flu-like illness.
Only one small trial with a total of 16 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. At present there is a lack of evidence to inform the treatment of psychosis in people with epilepsy, and further randomized controlled trials are needed.
The last search for trials was conducted in March 2015.
People need more and better treatment options for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19) or mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19. We wanted to know if inhaled corticosteroids are an effective and helpful treatment option for COVID-19 in any setting (for example, home or hospital) and whether they cause unwanted effects.
We were interested in:
– death from any cause up to day 30, day 60, or longer if reported;
– admission to hospital or death within 30 days;
– whether symptoms resolved and how fast;
– quality of life;
– unwanted effects. We looked for studies where the investigators compared inhaled corticosteroids and usual care to usual care only, sometimes in addition to a dummy medicine that did not contain any active ingredients (placebo) but was given in the same way. To make the comparison least skewed and more fair, patients in the studies must all have had the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive the inhaled corticosteroids or the other treatment. The studies could include people of any age, sex, or ethnicity.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. Three studies compared inhaled corticosteroids plus usual care compared to usual care with or without placebo in people with a confirmed diagnosis of mild COVID-19. These studies analysed 2171 participants mostly older than 50 years and with other medical problems, 52% of them were female, of whom 1057 received inhaled corticosteroids in our analyses. We found no studies that included people with asymptomatic infection or confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COVID-19.
We also found 10 ongoing studies, and four completed studies without published results. All studies compared inhaled corticosteroids with usual care or placebo. The studies included only people with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild disease. No studies looked at hospitalised people or people with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inhaled corticosteroids
– may make little to no difference in death from any cause up to day 30;
– probably reduce the risk of admission to hospital or occurrence of death up to day 30;
– probably increase resolution of COVID-19 symptoms at day 14 and may reduce time to symptom resolution.
We are very uncertain about a possible difference in serious unwanted effects. Moreover, inhaled corticosteroids may result in little to no difference in the number of any unwanted effects or additional infections. The studies were conducted in populations from wealthy countries, prior to the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programmes. We have moderate confidence in the evidence for the outcomes of symptom resolution at day 14 and hospital admission. We have low confidence in the evidence for the effects on deaths from any cause for people with mild COVID-19 and time to symptom resolution. The confidence in the unwanted or serious unwanted effects and infections is low or very low, because of the differences in the way investigators recorded and reported results. There was no evidence for people with asymptomatic infection or moderate-to-severe COVID-19 who were hospitalised. Our evidence is up-to-date to 7 October 2021.
We found 31 studies involving 23,762 people with heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Patients were given either a heart failure medicine compared to standard care or a placebo. The treatment they received was decided by random chance. Although there were many different treatments studied, unfortunately, few of them looked at the same type of medicine. As well, there were many different ways that researchers measured what happened when patients took these medicines. As a result, we could not combine the studies together and clarify the benefits and harms of each treatment. Existing studies cannot really tell us whether medicines used to treat heart failure in the general population are effective or safe for people who have both heart failure and chronic kidney disease. We are not able to recommend which heart failure medicines are best for people with heart failure and chronic kidney disease. We need more information from large clinical studies. Most of the heart failure studies did not report treatment effects separately based on levels of kidney function. Obtaining this information from existing studies may be helpful to learn more about how to treat heart failure in people with chronic kidney disease.
Our review found 15 studies that compared a combination of ICS/LABA with ICS alone. We found that on the whole, combination inhalers reduced the frequency of flare-ups (not including hospitalisations) compared with ICS alone. The studies showed that on average, the number of exacerbations per participant was reduced, as was the probability of death, during treatment. Quality of life and lung function showed improvement with combination treatment compared with ICS, but no difference between them was noted in terms of adverse effects, or the likelihood of having no flare-ups at all. Future research should assess the efficacy of BDF and MF/F because most evidence gathered to date, including for mortality, has been drawn from FPS studies.
Systematic review authors included 57 randomised controlled trials with a total of 9865 individuals undergoing laparoscopy. The RCTs compared 25 different laparoscopic entry techniques. Patients included in the review were men, women, and children who required laparoscopic surgery for a range of gynaecological and non-gynaecological conditions. Most of these studies included low-risk patients, and many studies excluded patients with high body mass index (BMI) and previous abdominal surgery. Fifty-three of 57 studies did not mention sources of funding. Two studies received funding from industry through a grant or through free use of medical equipment during trials. Two studies received government funding. The evidence is current to January 2018. Evidence is insufficient to show whether there were differences between groups in the rate of failed entry, vascular injury, or visceral injury, or in other major complications with the use of an open-entry technique in comparison to a closed-entry technique.
Comparison of closed techniques revealed a reduction in the risk of failed entry with use of a direct trocar entry technique in comparison to a Veress needle entry technique (8 RCTs; 3185 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Here the evidence suggests that for every 1000 patients operated on, 65 patients in the Veress needle group will experience failed entry compared to between 11 and 22 patients in the direct trocar group (i.e. between 43 and 54 fewer incidents of failed entry occurred per 1000 patients operated on with a direct trocar vs a Veress needle). Evidence was insufficient to show whether there were differences between groups in vascular injury, visceral injury, solid organ injury, or other major complications.
Evidence was insufficient to show whether there were differences between direct vision entry and Veress needle entry in rates of vascular injury or visceral injury. Equally, evidence was insufficient to show whether there were differences between direct vision entry and open entry in rates of visceral injury, solid organ injury, or failed entry.
Evidence was insufficient to show whether there were differences in rates of vascular injury, visceral injury, or solid organ injury between use of radially expanding trocars and use of non-expanding trocars.
Other studies compared a wide variety of other laparoscopic entry techniques, but all evidence was of very low quality and evidence was insufficient to support the use of one technique over another.
Overall, evidence is insufficient to support the use of one laparoscopic entry technique over another. Researchers noted an advantage of direct trocar entry over Veress needle entry for failed entry. No study in any comparison reported any deaths.
More research is required to examine the safety of entry techniques and to discover whether the risk of major complications differs between techniques. Most evidence is of very low quality; the main limitations were imprecision (due to small sample sizes and very low event rates) and risk of bias associated with poor reporting of study methods.
We wanted to know:
what type of PPE or combination of PPE gives healthcare workers the best protection;
whether modifying PPE for easier removal is effective;
whether following guidance on removing PPE reduced contamination;
whether training reduced contamination. We found 24 relevant studies with 2278 participants that evaluated types of PPE, modified PPE, procedures for putting on and removing PPE, and types of training. Eighteen of the studies did not assess healthcare workers who were treating infected patients but simulated the effect of exposure to infection using fluorescent markers or harmless viruses or bacteria. Most of the studies were small, and only one or two studies addressed each of our questions. Covering more of the body leads to better protection. However, as this is usually associated with increased difficulty in putting on and removing PPE, and the PPE is less comfortable. Coveralls are the most difficult PPE to remove but may offer the best protection, followed by long gowns, gowns and aprons. Respirators worn with coveralls may protect better than a mask worn with a gown, but are more difficult to put on. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar levels of contamination but be more comfortable. Contamination was common in half the studies despite improved PPE. Gowns that have gloves attached at the cuff, so that gloves and gown are removed together and cover the wrist area, and gowns that are modified to fit tightly at the neck may reduce contamination. Also, adding tabs to gloves and face masks may lead to less contamination. However, one study did not find fewer errors in putting on or removing modified gowns. Following CDC guidance for apron or gown removal, or any instructions for removing PPE compared to an individual’s own preferences may reduce self-contamination. Removing gown and gloves in one step, using two pairs of gloves, and cleaning gloves with bleach or disinfectant (but not alcohol) may also reduce contamination. Face-to-face training, computer simulation and video training led to fewer errors in PPE removal than training delivered as written material only or a traditional lecture. Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence is limited because the studies simulated infection (i.e. it was not real), and they had a small number of participants. There were no studies that investigated goggles or face shields. We are unclear about the best way to remove PPE after use and the best type of training in the long term.
Hospitals need to organise more studies, and researchers need to agree on the best way to simulate exposure to a virus.
In future, simulation studies need to have at least 60 participants each, and use exposure to a harmless virus to assess which type and combination of PPE is most protective.
It would be helpful if hospitals could register and record the type of PPE used by their workers to provide urgently needed, real-life information. This review includes evidence published up to 20 March 2020.
This review included seven studies (specifically randomised controlled trials), involving 735 people. The studies compared RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke. Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke. The included trials were carried out in China, Denmark, and the UK. The results of this review are current up to January 2018. In people with narrowing of arteries in the brain, RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. In people being treated with stenting (the insertion of a metal or plastic tube) for narrowed arteries in the neck, RIC may reduce the size of new brain injuries caused by reduced blood flow. However, its effect on clinical outcomes (stroke and death) was unclear. Adverse events were significantly more common in the RIC group but were not reported to be severe.
Among people with acute ischaemic stroke (where it had only been several hours from symptom onset) who received clot-dissolving medicines, we found that RIC may increase the risk of death or dependency (needing help from others). We found no significant differences in the size of the final stroke. In people with acute ischaemic stroke and chronic blood vessel disease of the brain, RIC did not affect measures of nerve function, mood, or thinking ability. There is low-quality evidence which suggests that RIC may help prevent recurrent stroke in people with narrowed arteries in the brain, and may increase death or dependency in people with acute ischaemic stroke who received clot dissolving medication. The evidence is less clear for reducing the volume of the stroke (size of brain lesion caused by low blood flow). Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these findings.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to December 2018. We found 14 reports (1579 participants). Studies were performed in nine different countries. Most participants were men, aged 39 to 47 years old, who had symptom from 9 to 18 years. Mostly, the programmes included exercises developed to improve strength, flexibility, stretching, and breathing, and were added to drug therapy or a biological agent. All data were obtained immediately upon completion of the exercise programme. Exercise probably slightly improves function (moderate-quality evidence), slightly reduces patient-reported disease activity (moderate-quality evidence), and may reduce pain (low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on spinal mobility and fatigue (very low-quality evidence).
Physical function was measured on a self-reporting questionnaire, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) scale (0 to 10; lower means better function). People who did not exercise rated their function at 4.1 points; those who exercised rated it 1.3 points lower (13% absolute improvement).
Pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0 to 10; lower means less pain). People who did not exercise rated their pain at 6.2 points; those who exercised rated it 2.1 points lower (21% absolute improvement).
Patient global assessment of disease activity was measured on a self-reporting questionnaire, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI, 0 to 10, lower means less disease activity). People who did not exercise rated their disease activity at 3.7 points; those who exercised rated it 0.9 points lower (9% absolute improvement).
Spinal mobility was measured on a self-reporting questionnaire, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI, 0 to 10, lower means better mobility). People who did not exercise rated their spinal mobility at 3.8 points; those who exercised rated it 0.7 points lower (7% absolute improvement).
Fatigue was measured on a VAS (0 to 10, lower means less fatigue). People who did not exercise rated their fatigue at 3 points; those who exercised rated it 1.4 points lower (14% absolute improvement). Exercise probably results in little or no improved function or reduced pain (moderate-quality evidence), and may have little or no effect in reducing patient-reported disease activity (low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on spinal mobility (very low-quality evidence).
Physical function. People who received usual care rated their function at 3.7 points on the BASFI; those who exercised rated it 0.4 points lower (4% absolute improvement).
Pain. People who received usual care rated their pain at 3.7 points on a 10-point VAS; those who exercised rated it 0.5 points lower (5% absolute improvement).
Patient global assessment of disease activity. People who received usual care rated their disease activity at 3.7 points on the BASDAI; those who exercised rated it 0.7 points lower (7% absolute improvement).
Spinal mobility. People who received usual care rated their spinal mobility at 8.9 points on the BASMI; those who exercised rated it 1.2 points lower (12% absolute improvement).
None of the studies measured fatigue. One of 67 participants in the exercise groups, and none of 43 participants in the control groups, experienced an AE. We downgraded the evidence due to issues with study design, variability between interventions, and not enough data, resulting in a rating of moderate to very low-quality evidence across outcomes.
We searched for studies up to 1st August 2014. A total of 32 studies were part of this review and included 6,075 patients in total. The studies were carried out in many different countries throughout Europe, Asia and North America. The studies were conducted between 1981 and 2014. The review showed that patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy were not any more likely to be alive at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after treatment compared with patients who received non-platinum-based chemotherapy.
Platinum-based chemotherapy, however, showed higher rates of complete tumour response (the complete disappearance of tumours, at least for a period of time after treatment) compared to non-platinum-based chemotherapy. Platinum-based chemotherapy also caused some more side effects, including nausea and vomiting, and low platelets.
Only four studies looked at quality of life but because they each used different methods to measure the effects, their results could not be combined. However, in each study there was no difference in the quality of life between the platinum-based chemotherapy group and the non-platinum-based chemotherapy group.
One way to help prevent necrotising enterocolitis may be to add synbiotics (combinations of probiotic bacteria or yeasts plus non-digestible sugars to support probiotic growth and colonisation) to milk feeds. We wanted to find out whether synbiotics might benefit very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Our outcomes of interest included necrotising enterocolitis, death from any cause, serious infection, duration of hospitalisation since birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. For our Cochrane Review, we searched several important databases to identify randomized controlled trials that investigated the use of synbiotics for preventing necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm and very low birth weight infants. We used standard Cochrane methods to conduct our review and perform our analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We found six trials with a total of 925 infant participants. Trials were mostly small, and most had design flaws that might have biased their findings. Combined analyses showed that giving synbiotics to very preterm or very low birth weight infants may reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis and death. Synbiotics may have little or no effect in reducing the risk of serious infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. None of the studies that we identified assessed the effect of synbiotics on disability or developmental outcomes. Although the evidence from randomised controlled trials can potentially be of high certainty, the methods used in our review's included trials may have introduced biases that exaggerated the benefits of giving synbiotics to very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Also, because most of the trials were small, the effect estimates for some outcomes were imprecise. For these reasons, we graded down the certainty of the evidence. All evidence in our review is of low or very low certainty.
There is low-certainty evidence that synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis and death from any cause. There is very low-certainty evidence that synbiotics may have little or no effect in preventing serious infection. We conducted our database searches on 17 June 2021.
We found that adding aldosterone blockers to a patient's current medications (ACEi or ARBs), lowered both protein in the urine and systolic blood pressure. Kidney function declined, however the effects on survival were uncertain. The addition of aldosterone blockers increased the amount of potassium in the blood. This may require medication changes, extra blood tests, and may be potentially harmful. Treatment with aldosterone blockers also increased the chance of short-term decline in kidney function and enlargement of male breast tissue. It is unclear as to whether aldosterone blockers protect kidney function or prevent heart disease in people who have CKD.
We included 12 studies. Six studies evaluated the effectiveness of educational materials alone; one study evaluated the effectiveness of educational meetings; and four studies evaluated a combination of the two in increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians. A further study evaluated the effectiveness of a complex educational campaign acting at society level. We searched for studies until January 2015. We found that the use of educational materials did not considerably increase the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases, but a legal obligation reminder message did. Furthermore, we found that the use of educational materials did not considerably increase the rate of reporting occupational diseases. Similarly, we found that the use of both educational materials and meetings did not considerably increase the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases or the rate of reporting. The same holds for the use of educational meetings alone. The use of an educational campaign appeared to increase the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases, although this was based on very low-quality evidence. We need high-quality studies to clarify the effectiveness of these interventions. This review was unable to determine the effectiveness of interventions other than education like the use of financial incentives, which could be an important form of motivation in changing physicians' behaviour. Such small-scale interventions could be investigated using larger randomised controlled trials, while the evaluation of large-scale interventions like legislation should use an interrupted time-series design.
This review assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals. Five studies were included involving 337 health professionals (including general practitioners, primary care teams and counsellors) and 8400 patients. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one in Canada and one in The Netherlands. At least 3000 patients were from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds and some of the health professional groups were also from CALD backgrounds. Due to differences in terminology and their cultural meanings, and the evolving nature of concepts and practices in this area, in this review we use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority, CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in the terms used by the relevant study authors.
The studies differed in how the education was provided and which outcome measures were used. Involvement in care improved in one study in The Netherlands measuring mutual understanding between minority CALD background patients and their doctors. Health behaviour also changed in one small study in the USA, in which women whose counsellors had received education were three times more likely to attend planned counselling sessions. However there was no evidence of an effect on a range of treatment outcomes or evaluations of care. None of the five included studies examined the effect of cultural competence education on healthcare organisations, or assessed adverse outcomes.
The review findings showed some support for cultural competence education for health professionals. These findings are tentative, however, as the quality of the evidence was low and more data are needed. Future research on cultural competence education for health professionals should seek greater consensus on the core components of cultural competence education, how participants are described and the outcomes assessed.
This methodology review was conducted to assess the effects of different methods for obtaining unpublished studies (data) and missing data from studies to be included in systematic reviews. Six studies met the inclusion criteria, two were randomised studies and four were observational comparative studies evaluating different methods for obtaining missing data.
Five studies assessed methods for obtaining missing data (i.e. data available to the original researchers but not reported in the published study). Two studies found that correspondence with study authors by e-mail resulted in the greatest response rate with the fewest attempts and shortest time to respond. The difference between the effect of a single request for missing information (by e-mail or surface mail) versus a multistage approach (pre-notification, request for missing information and active follow-up) was not significant for response rate and completeness of information retrieved (one study). Requests for clarification of methods (one study) resulted in a greater response than requests for missing data. A well-known signatory had no significant effect on the likelihood of authors responding to a request for unpublished information (one study). One study assessed the number of attempts made to obtain missing data and found that the number of items requested did not influence the probability of response. In addition, multiple attempts using the same methods did not increase the likelihood of response.
One study assessed methods to obtain unpublished studies (i.e. data for studies that have never been published). Identifying unpublished studies ahead of time and then asking the drug industry to provide further specific detail proved to be more fruitful than sending of a non-specific request.
Those carrying out systematic reviews should continue to contact authors for missing data, recognising that this might not always be successful, particularly for older studies. Contacting authors by e-mail results in the greatest response rate with the fewest number of attempts and the shortest time to respond.
We identified one randomized controlled trial with 262 patients. We excluded other study designs as they give less reliable results. However, randomized studies are difficult to perform in children with neuroblastoma and other evidence might be available. In the identified randomized study, patients with high-risk neuroblastoma were randomized to receive either rapid COJEC or standard OPEC/OJEC induction chemotherapy. Complete response, treatment-related mortality, overall survival, and event-free survival were not different between the two treatment alternatives. Results of both early and late toxicities were not clear cut, for example, some early toxicities were in favor of the standard arm and some late non-hematological toxicities were in favor of the rapid COJEC arm. For other toxicities there was no evidence of a difference between the treatment arms. Data on progression-free survival and health-related quality of life were not reported. Not all biases could be ruled out in this study. Before definitive conclusions can be made more research is needed.
This review aimed to determine the efficacy of early interventions, including psychological, social and pharmacological interventions to prevent relapse or recurrence of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. The review included nine studies that assessed the efficacy of antidepressant medication and psychological therapies in reducing the risk of a future depressive episode in children and adolescents. Trials varied in their quality and methodological design, limiting conclusions that could be drawn from the result. Overall, the review found that antidepressant medication reduces the chance that children and adolescents will experience another episode of depression, compared with a pill placebo. Psychological therapies also look promising as a treatment to prevent future depressive episodes, however given the aforementioned issues concerning trial quality and design, along with the small number of trials included in the review, it is unclear how effective these therapies are at present.
In our systematic review we could not identify substantial differences in the safety and efficacy between insulin species. Many important patient-oriented outcomes like health-related quality of life and effects on diabetic complications and mortality were never investigated. Human insulin was introduced into the market without scientific proof of advantage over existing purified animal insulins, especially porcine insulin.
In this review we aimed to determine whether there is evidence for the effectiveness of inhaled sodium cromoglycate as maintenance treatment in children with chronic asthma. Most of the studies were carried out in small groups of patients. Furthermore, we suspect that not all studies undertaken have been published. The results show that there is insufficient evidence to be sure about the beneficial effect of sodium cromoglycate compared to placebo. However, for several outcome measures the results favoured sodium cromoglycate.
We included trials comparing people with hemophilia receiving any psychological intervention compared with other individuals receiving a different intervention or no intervention at all.
We found seven trials with 362 people with hemophilia aged between 6 and 65 years of age. Trials compared either a DVD plus information booklet or computerised learning or auto-hypnosis (self-hypnosis) or relaxation techniques to no treatment and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The trials lasted from one to six months. All treatments were safe, no major side effects were reported. Psycho-educational interventions in children and adolescents seemed to promote a sense of self-efficacy and better self-management skills, but the quality of the evidence suggests that more rigorous experimental design is required. One trial in adults did not show any effect. Self-hypnosis and relaxation techniques were not tested for the primary outcome but were useful in decreasing the number and severity of joint bleeds when drug treatment was not available. The effects of these interventions on quality of life vary. The major problem we encountered in this review is the difference in trial designs, interventions and outcome measures used across the trials. We strongly suggest that researchers in the field consider developing a core outcome set to streamline future research. Randomization was proven to be safe and acceptable in this research field, and blinding of outcome assessors should be considered in the presence of patient-reported outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence was low to very low.
We were looking for studies that assessed the morbidity and mortality of ventilated people who were at least one year old. We were looking for studies in which the intention in one group of people was to maintain low levels of blood oxygen, and the intention in the other group of people was to maintain normal levels of blood oxygen. We included studies involving people irrespective of gender, ethnicity and past medical history. The evidence is current to November 2013. Our search yielded 2419 results. After exclusion of duplications, 1651 candidate studies were identified. Upon assessing the titles and abstracts of candidate studies, we found that none met our inclusion criteria. We are therefore unable to identify or comment as to whether allowing for low blood oxygen levels is beneficial. As no studies were included in our review, we cannot comment on the quality of evidence. Given the lack of evidence related to safety issues regarding allowing for low, as opposed to normal, levels of blood oxygen, we recommend caution with respect to changing current medical practice in this area. We do believe however that future research into this question is necessary.
In this review, we investigated how well nalbuphine worked, compared to placebo and other opioids, in children with postoperative pain. We also looked at the side effects. We performed a systematic literature search in July 2013. Ten randomised controlled trials with 658 patients were included. The patients were children aged from 0 - 18 years and most did not have any other relevant medical conditions. The overall quality of evidence was low, so this review could not definitively show that nalbuphine is better than placebo. The same holds true for the comparison with other opioids (morphine, tramadol, pethidine, piritramid). We were not able to comment on side effects due to the small numbers of participants in the trials. Future studies need to address these issues, including more robust data for effectiveness and side effects.
This review of 14 studies, involving 1617 participants, found that people who had a recent stroke were more independent in personal activities of daily living and more likely to maintain these abilities if they received therapy services at home. The amount of benefit that can be achieved is uncertain.
We could not tell whether people taking LAMA were more or less likely to need oral corticosteroids for an asthma attack than people taking LABA because not many people needed them and the studies showed different results; overall three more people in 1000 might have an asthma attack on LAMA, but the real result could be anywhere between 29 fewer and 61 more than if you took a LABA. Similarly, too few people in the studies had serious side effects or asthma attacks that required urgent medical treatment to judge whether one treatment was better than the other.
The studies showed that LAMAs might be a bit better than LABA for lung function (how well your lungs work), and LABAs slightly better for quality of life, but the differences were small and we could not tell if one was better than the other for most outcomes.
The results were mostly based on four good studies of around 2000 people, which were between 14 and 24 weeks of duration. All of the studies looked at a LAMA drug called tiotropium.
We found 62 studies in 2440 adults (average age 47 to 76 years) who had had a stroke and were learning to walk again. The effects of physiotherapy plus electromechanical and robotic devices for gait training were compared with the effects of physiotherapy alone or usual care. In most studies, the training period lasted three to four weeks; the shortest time was 10 days, and the longest eight weeks. At the end of training, compared with physiotherapy or usual care, using a gait‑training device plus physiotherapy:
• helped more people walk independently (38 studies; 1567 people);
• may have increased people's average walking speed (42 studies; 1600 people);
• probably did not increase how far people could walk in six minutes (24 studies; 983 people); and
• probably did not increase how many people dropped out of the study, or how many people died (62 studies; 2440 people).
For every eight people treated with a device plus physiotherapy, one extra person could walk independently by the end of treatment. We are confident that gait-training devices plus physiotherapy help more people walk independently than physiotherapy or usual care alone. This result is unlikely to change with more evidence.
We are moderately confident about the effects of these devices plus physiotherapy on distance walked in six minutes, how many people dropped out, and how many died. However, these results may change when more evidence becomes available.
We are less confident about the effects of these devices on walking speed; this result is likely to change with more evidence.
We identified 26 trials with 2271 women that either compared laparoscopic colposuspension with other types of surgery for managing urinary incontinence or compared different approaches of laparoscopic colposuspension. All the trials followed up the women for at least 18 months after surgery, with some trials lasting around five years. We looked at the robustness of each trial’s methods and the number of women involved to judge the quality of the evidence they presented. High-quality evidence means that we are confident that laparoscopic colposuspension with sutures (keyhole surgery with stitches) is as effective as open colposuspension (traditional surgery) for curing incontinence in the short term (up to 18 months after surgery). However, we are not sure whether there are fewer risks of complications during and after surgery with laparoscopic or open colposuspension.
Procedures using a midurethral sling (a sort of hammock that supports the neck of the bladder) may be as effective as laparoscopic colposuspension in curing urinary incontinence in the short term and avoiding surgical complications. Women may be less likely to need repeat surgery with a ‘sling’ than with laparoscopic colposuspension. We are not sure about these results because the evidence was low quality.
Laparoscopic colposuspension with two sutures may be better than with one suture for curing urinary incontinence in the short term, and for reducing the risk of voiding dysfunction and the need for more surgery, but there may be little difference between laparoscopic colposuspension with two sutures or with one in terms of surgical complications. Again, we are not sure about these results because the evidence was low quality.
We are very uncertain whether laparoscopic colposuspension with mesh and staples is better than open colposuspension or laparoscopic colposuspension with sutures for curing urinary incontinence. We are also very uncertain whether women who have laparoscopic colposuspension with mesh and staples or with sutures need less repeat surgery. We are very uncertain about the results because the quality of evidence was very low.
The evidence that we found relating to the effect of laparoscopic colposuspension on quality of life was inconclusive and could not be generalised. In general, the quality of the evidence was low. This means that we cannot be certain about the overall effectiveness of laparoscopic colposuspension compared to other treatments for urinary incontinence due to low numbers of women participating in the trials, risk of bias, and differences between trials in the statistical results.
We conducted a systematic search of the literature on preventing voice disorders in adults. We then appraised the quality of the studies found and combined their results. We found six studies which met our inclusion criteria. Four were conducted with teachers, one with student teachers and one with telemarketers.
We found no evidence that either direct or indirect voice training nor the two combined are effective in improving vocal functioning when measured using self-reported outcomes and when compared to no intervention.
All the included studies were small and of low methodological quality. Given the extent of the problem and the widespread use of voice training, further research is warranted.
We searched electronic databases and abstracts for relevant studies. The search was last updated in June 2015. We found six studies, with 350 participants followed-up for at least three months. All of these studies enrolled participants undergoing knee replacement. Because the studies did not report the same outcomes, it was difficult to pool the results. We could only pool three out of six randomized controlled trials studying regional anaesthesia for better function after total knee replacement. Pooling data from 140 participants, with range of motion assessed at three months after surgery, there was no statistically significant difference between the use of regional analgesia and conventional pain control with intravenous medications.
None of the included studies examined long-term adverse effects like persistent nerve damage. We deemed the quality of the evidence to be very low, as the included studies were not considered to be of high calibre and included few participants. We do not have enough information to determine if regional anaesthesia improves function after major joint replacement or not. We need more and better clinical trials to decide whether there is an effect of regional analgesia on the surgical results after total shoulder, hip or knee replacement surgery. We need more research to understand if regional analgesia increases the risk of falls after joint replacement.
This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014. We searched for new evidence in October 2019. Twenty-nine randomised controlled studies, involving 3839 women, are now included. The studies were published from 1975 to 2016 and were mainly carried out in high-income countries. They included women at increased risk of VTE who were pregnant, in childbirth, and after the birth. Treatments assessed included different types and doses of heparin (of low molecular weight heparin and unfractionated heparin), and compression stockings or devices. No deaths occurred. The reported findings were supported by very low-certainty evidence.
Starting treatment during pregnancy (with or without treatment after childbirth): we looked at the occurrence of symptomatic VTE and adverse effects that caused women to stop treatment. Any benefits of heparin were unclear when compared with no treatment or a placebo (assessed in up to four studies with 476 women). Similarly, for different types of heparin (assessed in up to four studies with 404 women), different doses of low molecular weight heparin (in one study with 144 women), and for compression stockings compared with no stockings (in one study with 44 women).
For treatment during and following vaginal or caesarean birth: we are very uncertain about the effects of heparin when compared with no treatment on the occurrence of symptomatic VTE (assessed in one study with 210 women). This study did not report on adverse effects that led women to stop treatment.
For treatment during and following caesarean birth: we are very uncertain about the effects of heparin compared with no treatment or a placebo (assessed in up to five studies with 1140 women). The studies looked at different types or doses of heparin, and compression devices compared with bed rest (in one study of 49 women). No adverse effects stopping treatment were reported.
Looking at treatment following vaginal or caesarean birth: no symptomatic VTEs were reported in women receiving either heparin or no treatment or placebo in two studies (58 women). No study reported on adverse effects leading to women stopping treatment. We are very uncertain if the benefits of treatments used to prevent deep vein clots in high-risk women during pregnancy and around the time of childbirth outweigh any harms. Small numbers of studies were included in the comparisons with a range of outcomes measured and low numbers of events. Some studies had design limitations and definitions of blood clotting risk factors and outcomes were not always clear. More, large, high-quality studies are needed.
We included 83 systematic reviews with evidence about whether or not the intervention was able to reduce pregnant women's chance of having a preterm birth or a baby death. Seventy of these reviews had information about preterm birth. We categorised the evidence we found as: clear benefit or harm; no effect; possible benefit or harm; or unknown effect. Clear benefit
We were confident that the following interventions were able to help specific populations of pregnant women avoid giving birth early: midwife-led continuity models of care versus other models of care for all women; screening for lower genital tract infections; and zinc supplementation for pregnant women without systemic illness. Cervical stitch (cerclage) was of benefit only for women at high risk of preterm birth and with singleton pregnancy.
Clear harm
We found no treatment that increased women’s chance of giving birth preterm.
Possible benefit
The following interventions may have helped some groups of pregnant women avoid preterm birth, but we have less confidence in these results: group antenatal care for all pregnant women; antibiotics for pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria; pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation; and vitamin D supplements alone for women without health problems.
Possible harm
We found two interventions that may have made things worse for some pregnant women: intramuscular progesterone for women at high risk of preterm birth with multiple pregnancy; and taking vitamin D supplements, calcium and other minerals for pregnant women without health problems. Clear benefit
We were confident in evidence for midwife-led continuity models of care for all pregnant women; and for fetal and umbilical Doppler for high-risk pregnant women; these interventions appeared to reduce women's chance of experiencing baby death.
Clear harm
We found no intervention that increased women’s risk of baby death.
Possible benefit
We found a possible benefit with cervical stitch (cerclage) for women with singleton pregnancy and high risk of preterm birth.
Possible harm
One review reported possible harm associated with having fewer antenatal visits, even for pregnant women at low risk of pregnancy problems. The pregnant women in this review already received limited antenatal care. Unknown benefit or harm
For pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth for any reason including multiple pregnancy, home uterine monitoring was of unknown benefit or harm. For high-risk pregnant women with multiple pregnancy: bedrest, prophylactic oral betamimetics, vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage were all of unknown benefit or harm. There is valuable information in the Cochrane Library relevant to women, doctors, midwives and researchers interested in preventing early birth. We have summarised the results of systematic reviews to describe how well different strategies work to prevent early birth and baby death. We organised our information in clear figures with graphic icons to represent how confident we were in the results and to point readers toward promising treatments for specific groups of pregnant women.
Our overview found no up-to-date information in the Cochrane Library for the important treatments of cervical pessary, vaginal progesterone or cervical assessment with ultrasound. We found no high-quality evidence relevant to women at high risk of preterm birth due to multiple pregnancy. It remains important for pregnant women and their healthcare providers to carefully consider whether specific strategies to prevent preterm birth will be of benefit for individual women, or for specific populations of women.
We systematically searched and evaluated randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of drug treatment for polydipsia. We found two short trials (n=17, duration 3-6 weeks) that were too small and short to be informative. Data reporting was also poor with no pre crossover data available for analysis. The only data available were for adverse effects and neither the active treatments nor placebo produced any serious side effects. The studies did not report any useful data on measures of polydipsia, physical symptoms secondary to increased fluid intake, mental state, general functioning or economic outcomes.
Clinicians hoping to treat people with psychosis-related polydipsia are unable to gain any useful information from these trials and treatment of any sort might only be informative within a well-designed study. More research is needed and these two trials, although unable to provide much data, do show this type of research is possible.
If fortifying condiments and seasonings with iron alone or iron plus other micronutrients improves measures of iron nutrition in the general population, in particular:
- anaemia;
- haemoglobin concentration;
- iron deficiency;
- iron status (including ferritin, transferrin saturation, and more).
We also wanted to find out if consuming iron-fortified condiments/seasonings was associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that provided iron-fortified condiments/seasonings to one group, and condiments/seasonings not fortified with iron to another. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on study characteristics. We identified 16 studies that involved 18,410 participants in middle-income countries, most within schools or communities, with study durations ranging from three months to two years. The type of iron-fortified condiments/seasonings used included salt, fish sauce, soy sauce, and seasoning powders. The dose of iron received by participants ranged from 4.4mg to 55 mg/day.
Compared to unfortified condiments/seasonings, those which are iron-fortified likely improve iron deficiency slightly. We are uncertain whether they reduce anaemia, improve haemoglobin, or other measures of iron status. Condiments/seasonings fortified with iron plus other micronutrients may reduce anaemia; we are uncertain about whether they improve haemoglobin or ferritin concentrations. They may improve iron deficiency and total iron binding capacity. No studies reported adverse effects. More studies are needed to determine the effect of iron-fortified condiments/seasonings on health such as malaria incidence, growth and development and any potential adverse effects. Our confidence in the evidence is very low to moderate; several factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, we observed limitations in the way few studies were conducted with respect to the recruitment of people to assign interventions (this means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments). Secondly, people in some studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, not all the studies provided data about everything that were interested in, and results were inconsistent across the different studies. Finally, some studies were small. The results of future research could differ from the results of this review. The evidence is up-to-date to January 2023. We judged the evidence in this review as very low to moderate certainty, which means we are not certain of the effect of condiments/seasonings with added iron on the reduction of anaemia and iron deficiency in people.
We included 15 studies in which adults with short-duration sinus infection, whether or not confirmed by imaging, randomly received antibiotics, or a dummy drug or no treatment, in ambulatory care settings. The studies included a total of 3057 adults whose average age was 36 years; about 60% were female. Participants were followed until they were cured. Trial duration ranged from 8 to 28 days. Seven studies received financial support from government or academic institutions; six received grants from the pharmaceutical industry; and five did not state sources of support. Without antibiotics, almost half of all participants were cured after one week, and two out of three were cured after 14 days. Five (diagnosis based on symptoms described to a doctor) to 11 (diagnosis confirmed by x-ray) more people per 100 were cured faster with antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan could better predict who would benefit from antibiotics, but routine use would cause health problems related to radiation exposure. Ten more people per 100 were relieved faster of thick, yellow discharge from the nose with antibiotics compared to a dummy drug or no treatment. Thirteen more people per 100 experienced side effects (mostly concerning stomach or intestines) with antibiotics compared to a dummy drug or no treatment. Compared with people who initially started antibiotics, five more people per 100 in the dummy drug or no treatment group had to start antibiotics because their condition worsened. Serious complications (e.g. brain abscess) were rare.
We found that antibiotics are not a first-choice treatment for adults with short-duration sinus infection. We found no evidence relating to adults with severe sinusitis or with reduced immunity, or to children. We found high-quality evidence when the diagnosis was based on symptoms described to a doctor. We downgraded evidence quality to moderate when diagnosis was confirmed by x-ray or CT scan because the number of participants was small, which makes the estimates less reliable.
The review of 22 trials, involving 6872 women and their babies, found that, in the short term, certain antibiotics given to women, when their waters break early, increase the time babies stay in the womb. They reduced infection, but did not save more babies. One antibiotic (co-amoxiclav) increased the number of babies with a rare condition of inflammation of the bowel (necrotising enterocolitis). Although, in the longer term (at seven years of age) antibiotics seem to have little effect on the health of children, the short-term advantages are such that we recommend antibiotics should be given routinely.
We found 16 randomised controlled trials with 1352 women. This type of trial randomly assigns people into two groups. In this case, one group received IVF plus growth hormone and the other group received IVF only. The evidence is current to 11 November 2020. In normal responders, with adjuvant GH use, the effect on live birth rate is very uncertain; if the chance of live birth without growth hormone is assumed to be 15%, the chance of live birth with growth hormone would be between 6% and 43%. There was not enough evidence to reach a conclusion regarding clinical pregnancy rates, number of women with at least one egg retrieved, embryo transfer achieved, and number of eggs retrieved in normal responders. The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of growth hormone on mean units of gonadotropin used in normal responders.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of growth hormone on live birth rate for poor responders, based on eight trials. If the chance of live birth without growth hormone is assumed to be 11%, the chance of live birth with growth hormone would be between 13% and 25%. Growth hormone results in a slight increase in pregnancy rates in poor responders, based on 11 trials with low-certainty evidence. The results suggest, if the pregnancy rate without growth hormone is assumed to be 15%, with growth hormone use, the pregnancy rate in poor responders would be between 19% and 31%. The evidence suggests that growth hormone results in little to no difference in the number of women with at least one oocyte retrieved, based on two trials with low-certainty evidence. If the chance of retrieving at least 1 egg in poor responders was 81%, with growth hormone the chance is between 87% and 99%. There is a slight increase in the mean number of oocytes retrieved with the use of growth hormone for poor responders, based on 12 trials with low-certainty evidence. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of growth hormone on embryo transfer achieved, based on four trials. If the chance of achieving embryo transfer is assumed to be 77%, the chance with use of growth hormone will be between 78% and 94%. Use of growth hormone results in reduction of mean units of gonadotropins used for stimulation in poor responders, based on eight trials with low-certainty evidence.
High heterogeneity in the analyses for the mean number of oocytes retrieved and the mean units of GH used suggests quite different effects according to differences including in trial protocols (populations, GH dose and schedule), so these results should be interpreted with caution.
We are uncertain of the effect of growth hormone on adverse events in normal or poor responders as 6 of the 16 included trials failed to report this outcome. The evidence was of low to very low certainty, with the main limitations being poor reporting of study methods, imprecise data and variability among the trials.
This review looks at whether taking antiemetics (medications to treat or prevent nausea and vomiting) before receiving an intravenous opioid reduces the risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting as side effects. We looked for studies involving adults (aged 16 years or older) who received prophylactic antiemetics compared with either placebo or standard care before receiving an intravenous opioid. We found three studies with a total of 527 patients. All the studies used metoclopramide as the antiemetic. Compared with placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for an antiemetic later on. There was also no difference in side effects between those who received antiemetics and those who did not. The studies investigated only one medication (metoclopramide) and did not report all the information we were interested in. The intervention probably makes little or no difference in terms of experiencing nausea or vomiting. This evidence is up to date to 17 January 2022.
We searched the medical literature up to April 2019 for trials that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of drugs proposed for the management of neurosyphilis in adults. We found only one randomised clinical trial that met our criteria (patients are randomly put into groups to receive different treatments). This trial involved 36 adults with both syphilis and HIV, who were mainly men, with a median age of 34 years. The trial compared two drugs: ceftriaxone (2 g once daily), and penicillin G (4 million units every 4 hours for 10 days). It was funded by a pharmaceutical company. The trial reported serological cure, which is a decrease in the levels of the infection shown by laboratory analysis of fluids in the brain and spinal cord (known as cerebrospinal fluids), and clinical cure, which is the absence of signs or symptoms of neurosyphilis. Only three of 18 participants receiving ceftriaxone and two of 18 participants receiving penicillin G achieved serological cure; and eight of 18 participants receiving ceftriaxone and two of 18 participants receiving penicillin G achieved clinical cure.
There was not enough evidence to allow us to state if there is a difference between treatment with ceftriaxone or Penicillin G for neurosyphilis in adults. The outcomes evaluated could change when trials with a better design become available. Additionally, we did not identify any evidence related to the effectiveness and safety of other drugs proposed to manage this condition. The quality of the evidence was very low for the outcomes serological cure and clinical cure due to problems with the trial's design and methods, and because there was only a small number of participants.
The main reason for study exclusion was study design; we found trials without a control group or focusing only on outcomes for the newborn baby such as birth weight, length or head circumference. Given the stigma attached to alcohol use in pregnancy, recruitment for outcomes trials is likely to remain difficult, which adversely affects generalizability. Clearly the availability of quality evidence would assist with ante-partum decision making by both the physician and mother.
We searched for evidence on 25 February 2019. We included 44 randomised studies that reported findings for 6940 women from a wide range of countries including high-, middle- and low-income countries.
Studies compared membrane sweeping with no intervention or sham intervention, and also compared membrane sweeping with vaginal or intracervical prostaglandins, oral misoprostol, oxytocin and repeated membrane sweeping.
Of the seven studies that reported financial funding, two studies reported funding from pharmaceutical companies. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was found to be low. Compared with no intervention or a sham sweep (40 studies involving 6548 women), allocated to membrane sweeping may be more likely to have spontaneous onset of labour, but we found no clear difference in unassisted vaginal births. Women may also be less likely to have formal induction of labour. We also found no clear differences between the groups for caesarean section, instrumental vaginal births or serious illness or death of the mother or baby.
Compared with vaginal or intracervical prostaglandins (four studies involving 480 women), we found no difference in any outcomes although data were limited.
We found insufficient data to draw any conclusions in the studies comparing membrane sweep with intravenous oxytocin, with or without breaking the waters, or with vaginal/oral misoprostol. Similarly for the comparison between different frequencies of membrane sweeping. Membrane sweeping appears to be effective in promoting labour but current evidence suggests this did not, overall, follow-on to unassisted vaginal births. Membrane sweeping may reduce formal induction of labour. Only three studies reported on women’s satisfaction with membrane sweeping. Women reported feeling positive about membrane sweeping. While acknowledging that it may be uncomfortable, they felt the benefits outweighed the harms and most would recommend it to other women. Further research is needed to confirm our review findings and to identify the ideal time for membrane sweep and whether having more than one sweep would be beneficial. Further information on women’s views is also needed.
We found one study from the United Kingdom involving 80 people with bronchiectasis. The study was completed in 2002, when management of bronchiectasis was different from today. Participants were divided into two groups: One group of outpatients was observed for a 12-month period under the care of the specialist nurse, and the other under care of the doctor. After 12 months, these participants swapped groups. We found no significant differences between nurse-led and doctor-led care in terms of lung function, infective flareups (exacerbations), or quality of life. In the first year of the study we noted increased costs for nurse-led care with more hospital admissions and greater use of antibiotic injections. The certainty of evidence in the one included study was satisfactory, given that the study design meant participants knew which group they belonged to. More research is required to determine how nurse specialists compare with doctors in providing safe and effective treatment for patients with stable bronchiectasis.
This Cochrane plain language summary was up-to-date as of March 2018.
We found only two studies enrolling 64 infants. In one of the two studies, there was a low risk of bias whereas in the second study there were concerns about how the infants had been put into treatment groups, and whether parents and doctors were aware of which treatment was given (random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of outcomes assessment). We found no studies that received funding from the industry. Prophylaxis with cromolyn sodium did not result in an important effect on the combined outcome of mortality or chronic lung disease at 28 days of age, chronic lung disease at 28 days; chronic lung disease at 28 days or at 36 weeks' PMA; or chronic lung disease in survivors at 28 days or at 36 weeks' PMA. This review of trials found no strong evidence that cromolyn sodium can prevent or reduce chronic lung disease and further research does not seem to be justified. The quality of evidence was low for most measures.
The review of trials found that the inhaled steroid, beclomethasone causes an average decrease in growth of about one and a half centimetres a year. However, it is not known whether there is any catch-up growth once the treatment is stopped. More research is needed.
Our search for studies (on 30 April 2015) identified nine randomised controlled studies involving 469 women, but only six trials (involving 383 women) contributed data towards this review. The studies included small numbers of women and were not generally of high quality.
None of the included studies reported data on cervical or uterine injury, which are rare events.
Cervical preparation, either using mechanical or chemical dilation with misoprostol, was shown to reduce the need for manual cervical dilatation and surgical time compared with placebo (two trials, 168 women).
Misoprostol was associated with more abdominal pain than placebo but no clear differences were observed in the risk of other adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache or fever.
Misoprostol and isosorbide mononitrate and dinitrate were similarly effective in ripening the cervix and reducing the need for manual cervical dilation (three trials, 150 women). Misoprostol caused more vomiting but with no clear differences in other reported adverse effects (headache, nausea or hypotension). The dosing regimens differed in terms of dose, number of administrations and route of administration in the different trials. Mechanical (Dilapan-S hygroscopic) dilators performed similarly to chemical dilators in a single trial (65 women) that measured difficulty in cervical dilation, excessive bleeding and adverse effects.
The medications or devices used did reduce the need for manual dilation of the cervix, but were associated with some side effects. These include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache and diarrhoea. The particular agents that we compared were misoprostol, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate and Dilapan-S hygroscopic dilators. No agent performed significantly better than another. The nine studies included in this review were small and the methodological quality of the trials was varied. For the most part, the study methods were not well-described; thus any conclusions drawn from the data included in this review must be treated with caution. Large, high-quality trials are required to understand whether easier dilation means there is less risk of injury to the woman's uterus or cervix during the surgery, or if there are any effects on future pregnancies.
70 studies were included in this review, with 44,958 students overall. We were interested mainly in studies with a follow-up period of four or more months to assess whether any effects were sustained beyond the immediate short term. In 43 of the trials, the social norms intervention was targeted at higher-risk students. 55 trials were conducted in the USA, with others form Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Delivery of social norms information included mailed feedback, web/computer feedback, individual face-to-face feedback, group face-to-face feedback and general social norms marketing campaigns across college campuses. Over the longer-term, after four or more months of follow-up, there was only a small effect of social norms information on binge drinking, drinking quantity, and peak BAC. For these outcomes, effects were not any different across the different delivery modes.Only small effects were found for web feedback and individual face-to-face feedback on frequency of alcohol consumed. Only a small effect of individual face-to-face feedback on alcohol related problems, but no effects were found for mailed or web feedback. Similarly, no effects were found for group face-to-face feedback or for marketing campaigns on frequency of alcohol consumed and typical BAC.
Our reading of these results is that, although we found some significant effects of social norms information, the strength of the effects over the longer-term is very small and therefore this information is unlikely to provide any advantage in practice. Overall, only low or moderate quality evidence was noted for the effects reported in this review. Problems with study quality could result in estimates of social norms effects that are too high, so we cannot rule out the chance that the effects observed in this review may be overstated.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health provided funding for just under half (33/70) of the studies included in this review. Eighteen studies provided no information about funding, and only 13 papers had a clear conflict of interest statement.
Seven randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1919 participants were included. All trials involved people, predominantly young adults, participating in regular sporting activities. Some trials were compromised by poor methodology, including lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data.
Four trials, including 287 participants, examined interventions directly targeted at preventing hamstring injuries. Three of these trials, which tested hamstring strengthening protocols, had contradictory findings and we could not conclude whether strengthening exercises of the hamstrings was beneficial or not. One small trial found that manual therapy (involving manipulation, massage and specific stretches to joints and muscles of the spine and leg) may prevent injuries of leg muscles, including the hamstrings.
Three inconclusive trials tested interventions for preventing all leg injuries for which data for hamstring injury were available. Two trials found no evidence for an effect for balance training on a wobble board (proprioceptive protocol). One trial found no evidence for a warm up/cool down and stretching protocol for distance runners.
Based on currently available research findings, no specific intervention can be recommended for decreasing the risk of incurring hamstring injuries.
In summary, therefore, data from the trials included in this review indicate little difference between the effects of these methods, except that women on DMPA are more likely to experience cessation of vaginal bleeding during its use. There was inadequate data to detect differences in some non-menstrual clinical effects, and considering that this contraceptive method remains in use in some countries, further research is indicated.
 .One included study used a 20°head-down tilt and head-up tilt of 20 degrees and the other used modified postural drainage (30°head-up tilt) compared to standard postural drainage (using a 30°head-down tilt). Children were randomly selected for one treatment or the other. One study was carried out over a 24-hour period and the second over two days, but with a five-year follow-up period. The age range of the participants varied from three weeks to 34 months. One included study was funded by the Sydney Children’s Hospital Foundation and the other by the Royal Children’s Hospital Research Foundation and Physiotherapy Research Foundation of Australia.  °head-down tilt and 20°head-up tilt did not find differences regarding the number of gastroesophageal reflux episodes between the two postural drainage regimens whereas the other study found that modified postural drainage (30°head-up tilt) was associated with fewer number of reflux episodes and fewer respiratory complications than standard postural drainage (using a 30°head-down tilt) in infants with cystic fibrosis. The age of participants, angle of tilt, reported outcomes, number of sessions and study duration differed between the two studies. However, the use of a 30°head-up tilt seems to result in fewer reflux episodes and respiratory complications than a 30° head-down tilt position. Even though one study did not find differences between two techniques, in most of the reflux episodes stomach contents reached the upper oesophagus with a potential for choking. This should make physiotherapists carefully consider their choice of technique. We do not envisage that there will be any new trials undertaken that will affect the conclusions of this review; therefore, we do not plan to update this review. Both studies were of moderate (so we think further research could have an important impact on the results) quality and appeared to be well run and we do not think any factors will influence the results in a negative way.
This review found a single randomised controlled trial that examined the short-term effects of cooling plus xenon for infants with HIE. This trial enrolled 92 participants. Cooling plus xenon did not improve clinical outcomes before discharge from the hospital compared with cooling alone. Data on long-term development were not provided. Current low quality evidence is inadequate to show whether cooling plus xenon improves survival and development of newborn babies with HIE. Evidence is up-to-date as of August 2017.
There are no nicotine vaccines currently licensed for public use, but there are a number in development. We found four trials (2642 participants) comparing nicotine vaccines to a placebo. These did not show that vaccines help people to stop smoking in the long term. All four trials were conducted by pharmaceutical companies as part of the drug development process and involved vaccines administered by injection. There were no trials testing whether nicotine vaccines helped keep people who had stopped smoking from starting to smoke again. Only two of the four trials had full results available. The two trials showed nicotine vaccines to be generally safe, with most side effects being mild or moderate. In one trial, flu-like symptoms were found to be a side effect of the nicotine vaccine. If nicotine vaccines become available to the general public they may have changed from the ones tested in these studies, meaning the results reported in this review, including those on side effects, may not apply to all nicotine vaccines.
The review of trials found that exercise training (including running, gymnastics, cycling, swimming, weights and walking) was well tolerated among the study participants. This review also found that physical training improved cardiopulmonary fitness and showed some positive effects for health-related quality of life. However, physical training had no significant effect on resting lung function. In summary, people with stable asthma should be encouraged to participate in regular exercise training that is within their capacity without fear of worsening of their asthma symptoms.
We aimed to find out whether ultrasound offers any advantages over palpation of the artery or Doppler auditory assistance. Specifically, we wanted to find out if ultrasound improved the following outcomes.
1. How often doctors can successfully insert the catheter on first attempt
2. The occurrence of complications such as haematoma and injury caused by reduced blood flow
3. How often doctors can successfully insert the catheter on the first two attempts
4. How often doctors can successfully insert the catheter after several attempts
5. The average number of attempts needed to insert the catheter
6. How long it takes to insert the catheter We searched the literature for controlled clinical studies comparing use of ultrasound with traditional ways of placing a catheter into an artery in children under the age of 18 years. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found nine eligible studies: eight comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. Seven studies were of radial artery cannulation and two studies were of femoral artery cannulation. Four studies did not mention any funding source and five studies had departmental funds. The studies included children aged from under one month to 18 years. We found that ultrasound guidance compared with traditional methods probably increases the rate of successful cannulation on first attempt, within the first two attempts, and after several attempts. Ultrasound guidance probably reduces the occurrence of haematoma, the number of attempts needed to successfully place an arterial catheter, and the time needed to perform successful cannulation. The evidence suggests that ultrasound is probably superior for arterial cannula insertion in children and adolescents, including very young children. Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because it was impossible to mask the doctors performing the cannulation (they knew which children had ultrasound-assisted cannulation), and because the studies included few children and reported few events. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.
This summary of an updated Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the benefits and harms of manual therapy and exercise compared with placebo, no intervention or any other intervention in people with rotator cuff disease. After searching for all relevant studies published up to March 2015, we included 60 trials (3620 participants), however only 10 looked at manual therapy and exercise in combination. Among the included participants, 52% were women, average age was 51 years and average duration of the condition was 11 months. The average duration of manual therapy and exercise interventions was six weeks. Overall pain (higher scores mean more improvement in pain reduction)
People who had manual therapy and exercise had improvements in pain that were little or no different to people who had placebo. Improvement in pain was 6.8 points more (ranging from 0.7 points less to 14.3 points more) at 22 weeks (7% absolute improvement).
People who had manual therapy and exercise rated their change in pain score as 24.8 points on a scale of 0 to 100 points.
People who had placebo rated their change in pain score as 17.3 points on a scale of 0 to 100 points.
Function (higher scores mean more improvement in function)
People who had manual therapy and exercise improved slightly more than people who had placebo. Improvement in function was 7.1 points more (ranging from 0.3 to 13.9 points more) at 22 weeks (7% absolute improvement).
People who had manual therapy and exercise rated their change in function as 22.4 points on a scale of 0 to 100 points.
People who had placebo rated their change in function as 15.6 points on a scale of 0 to 100 points.
Treatment success
16 more people out of 100 rated their treatment as successful with manual therapy and exercise compared with placebo, 16% absolute improvement (ranging from 2% less to 34% more improvement).
Fifty-seven out of 100 people reported treatment success with manual therapy and exercise.
Forty-one out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo.
Side effects
23 more people out of 100 people had minor side effects such as temporary pain after treatment with manual therapy and exercise compared with placebo.
Thirty-one out of 100 people reported side effects with manual therapy and exercise.
Eight out of 100 people reported side effects with placebo. High quality evidence from one trial suggested that manual therapy and exercise improved function only slightly more than placebo at 22 weeks, was little or no different to placebo in terms of other patient-important outcomes (e.g. overall pain), and was associated with relatively more frequent but mild adverse events.
Low quality evidence suggested that there may be little or no difference in overall pain and function when manual therapy and exercise is compared with glucocorticoid injection, there may be little or no difference in overall pain and function when manual therapy and exercise is compared with arthroscopic subacromial decompression, and people who receive acupuncture plus dietary counselling and Phlogenzym supplement may have less pain and better function than people receiving manual therapy and exercise.
We are uncertain whether firstly, manual therapy and exercise improves function more than oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), and secondly, combining manual therapy and exercise with glucocorticoid injection provides additional improvement in function over glucocorticoid injection alone, because the quality of the evidence was very low.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition associated with high morbidity, mortality and cost to the community. Patients often report symptomatic improvement with long acting beta-2 agonists (LABAs) and anticholinergic bronchodilator medications (ipratropium). These medications have different mechanisms of action and therefore theoretically could have an additive effect when combined. As these medications are prescribed in COPD as long term therapy, it is important to know what benefit there are, if any, of prescribing ipratropium alone or as combination therapy over LABAs. Seven studies (2652 participants) were included. Salmeterol was more effective than ipratropium on lung function, but there were no major differences seen between the responses to ipratropium and salmeterol on symptoms. When we compared the combination of these two drugs with salmeterol, combination was superior to salmeterol in terms of quality of life, but the differences between these two treatments on other measurements were small and inconsistent. The findings of the review would not support a general recommendation for the use of ipratropium bromide over a beta-2 agonist alone in COPD, but the combination does confer greater benefit in health status. At this stage, people with COPD should use the bronchodilator that gives them the most improvement in their symptoms. Combination therapy should be considered, but the relative effects of this therapy in relation to other forms of inhaled therapy such as inhaled steroids and tiotropium are unknown. Cost considerations also need to be taken into account as there are considerable variations in price of bronchodilators.
We wanted to find out if caffeine is better than aminophylline or theophylline in preterm babies for:
• preventing death prior to hospital discharge;
• improving long-term development at age 18 to 24 months of age.
We also wanted to find out if these medicines were associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that looked at caffeine compared with aminophylline or theophylline in preterm babies. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 22 studies in our review, with a total of 1776 preterm newborns. Three studies evaluated the use of methylxanthines for apnea prevention; 13 studies evaluated their use for apnea treatment; two for extubation management (that is, removing the tube placed in the windpipe to help a baby breath). In three studies, there were different reasons to treat the babies with methylxanthines. Almost all studies included babies that were born, on average, after 28 to 32 weeks of gestation and with an average weight at birth between 1000 and 1500 grams. No studies had an average length of gestation of less than 28 weeks or an average birth weight of less than 1000 grams. In one study, the babies had an average length of gestation of more than 32 weeks. In two studies, the average birth weight was greater than 1500 grams.
• For the frequency of death, we found that there may be little to no difference between the use of caffeine compared to other methylxanthines. 
• When looking at abilities associated with the development of the brain, it is unclear which is the better option: caffeine or other methylxanthines.
• Some babies with apnea episodes develop long-lasting lung disease. Our review indicates that there may be little to no difference between the use of caffeine and other methylxanthines for long-lasting lung disease. 
• It is unclear if caffeine results in more unwanted effects compared to other methylxanthines. 
• We found that there may be no difference in how long the babies and their families need to stay in the hospital with the use of caffeine compared to other methylxanthines. Our confidence in the evidence is limited because the number of babies studied for each outcome we were interested in was small. All babies were randomly placed into groups receiving either caffeine or another methylxanthine (aminophylline or theophylline). However, in many studies, it is possible that staff working with the babies were aware of which treatment the babies were getting. Furthermore, the evidence did not cover all the outcomes we were interested in. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.
We searched for randomized controlled studies of immediate and early SSC on 17 December 2015. We found thirty-eight studies with 3472 women that provided data for analysis. Most studies compared early SSC with standard hospital care for women with healthy full-term babies. In eight studies women gave birth by cesarean, and in six studies the babies were healthy but born preterm at 35 weeks or more. More women who had SSC with their babies were still breastfeeding at one to four months after giving birth (14 studies, 887 women, moderate-quality evidence ). Mothers who had SSC breast fed their infants longer, too, on average over 60 days longer (six studies, 264 women, low-quality evidence ). Babies held in SSC were more likely to have breast fed successfully during their first breast feed (five studies, 575 women). Babies held in SSC had higher blood glucose levels (three studies, 144 women, low-quality evidence ), but similar temperature to babies with standard care (six studies, 558 women, low-quality evidence). We had too few babies in our included studies and the quality of the evidence was too low for us to be very confident in the results for infants.
Women giving birth by cesarean may benefit from early SSC, with more women breastfeeding successfully and still breastfeeding at one to four months (fourteen studies, 887 women, moderate-quality evidence), but there were not enough women studied for us to be confident in this result.
We found no clear benefit to immediate SSC rather than SSC after the baby had been washed and examined. Neither did we find any clear advantage of a longer duration of SSC (more than one hour) compared with less than one hour. Future trials with more women and infants may help us answer these questions with confidence.
SSC was defined in various ways and different scales and times were used to measure different outcomes. Women and staff knew they were being studied, and women in the standard care groups had varying levels of breastfeeding support. These differences lead to wide variation in the findings and a lower quality evidence. Many studies were small with less than 100 women participating. The evidence from this updated review supports using immediate or early SSC to promote breastfeeding. This is important because we know breastfeeding helps babies avoid illness and stay healthy. Women giving birth by cesarean may benefit from early SSC but we need more studies to confirm this. We still do not know whether early SSC for healthy infants helps them make the transition to the outside world more smoothly after birth, but future good quality studies may improve our understanding. Despite our concerns about the quality of the studies, and since we found no evidence of harm in any included studies, we conclude the evidence supports that early SSC should be normal practice for healthy newborns including those born by cesarean and babies born early at 35 weeks or more.
We found 44 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing diet, physical activity and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments (interventions) to a variety of control groups delivered to 4781 overweight or obese adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Our systematic review reports on the effects of multidisciplinary interventions, dietary interventions and physical activity interventions compared with a control group (no intervention, 'usual care,' enhanced usual care or some other therapy if it was also delivered to the intervention group). The adolescents in the included studies were monitored (called follow-up) for between six months and two years. The average age of adolescents ranged from 12 to 17.5 years. Most studies reported the body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m2). We summarised the results of 28 studies in 2774 adolescents reporting BMI, which on average was 1.18 kg/m2 lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. We summarised the results of 20 studies in 1993 adolescents reporting weight, which on average was 3.67 kg lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. BMI reduction was maintained at 18 to 24 months of follow-up (monitoring participants until the end of the study), which on average was 1.49 kg/m2 lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. The interventions moderately improved health-related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) but we did not find firm evidence of an advantage or disadvantage of these interventions for improving self-esteem, physical activity and food intake. No study reported on death from any cause, morbidity (illnesses) or socioeconomic effects (such as days away from school). Three studies reported no side effects, one reported no serious side effects, one did not provide details of side effects and the rest of the studies did not report whether side effects occurred or not.
We identified 50 ongoing studies which we will include in future updates of our review. This evidence is up to date as of July 2016. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low for most of the outcomes (results) measured, mainly because of limited confidence in how studies were performed, inconsistent results between the studies and the way that some outcomes used do not capture obesity outcomes directly. Also, there were just a few studies for some outcomes, with small numbers of included adolescents.
The authors found no published or pending randomised controlled trials that compared DCS with immediate and definitive repair in patients with major abdominal trauma. Evidence that supports efficacy of DCS compared with traditional laparotomy is therefore limited.
For women wishing to become pregnant spontaneously, we found one trial (200 women). For women undergoing IVF, we included ten trials (3750 women). All trials evaluated the effects of screening hysteroscopy compared to no hysteroscopy. The evidence is current to September 2018. In women wishing to become pregnant spontaneously, hysteroscopy was associated with a higher chance for an ongoing and clinical pregnancy in one study at high risk of bias. The trial reported no adverse events following hysteroscopy. The miscarriage rate was higher following hysteroscopy.
In women undergoing IVF, the included studies suggested that performing a screening hysteroscopy first, improved the chances of live birth or clinical pregnancy. However, adverse events following hysteroscopy were poorly reported, and therefore, we were unable to assess the safety of this intervention. For women at a typical clinic with a 22% live birth rate, performing a screening hysteroscopy would be expected to result in live birth rates between 25% and 32%. There was no increased risk of miscarriage following hysteroscopy.
We found no trials with women who were seeking intrauterine insemination. There was very low-quality evidence from one study in women who were trying to become pregnant spontaneously.
There was low-quality evidence that a screening hysteroscopy, performed prior to IVF, may increase the chance of live birth or clinical pregnancy, and very low-quality evidence about adverse events following hysteroscopy. The quality of the evidence was reduced because of risk of bias and statistical heterogeneity.
We searched for randomised controlled studies (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We compared and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. We found 52 studies that involved a total of 6690 adults with BCC. Most studies (48 out of 52) included hospital outpatients with small, superficial or nodular BCC. Studies lasted for between six weeks and 10 years (average duration: 13 months). Twenty-two studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies.
Our confidence in the evidence presented here is low to moderate, mainly because many studies were small.
Comparison between different surgical treatments
- Mohs micrographic surgery (a specialised surgical approach that removes less skin) may slightly decrease recurrence rates at three and five years compared to surgical excision (one of the most common surgical treatments for BCC).
-There may be little to no difference in how well scars heal between these two surgical treatments according to patients and observers (one study).
Surgery versus non-surgical treatments
Compared against surgical excision:
- Imiquimod (an anti-cancer cream) probably increases BCC recurrence rates at three and five years. There may be little to no difference in scar healing according to patients, although imiquimod may increase chances of scars healing well when healing is rated by an observer (one study).
- Radiotherapy may increase BCC recurrence rates at three and four years, and probably decreases chances of scars healing well (one study).
- MAL-PDT, a type of photodynamic therapy (that uses a light source and light-sensitive medicine to kill cancer cells), may increase BCC recurrence rates at three years. MAL-PDT probably increases chances of scars healing well (two studies).
Comparison of different non-surgical treatments
Compared against imiquimod:
- MAL-PDT probably increases BCC recurrence rates at three and five years. There is probably little to no difference in scar healing (one study); Overall, the evidence suggests that:
- surgery could reduce chances of BCC recurrence;
- non-surgical treatments such as anti-cancer creams or photodynamic therapy carry an increased chance of BCC recurrence, but could increase chances of scars healing well compared with surgery.
Complications with surgical treatments include wound infections, skin graft failure and bleeding after the procedure. Non-surgical treatments frequently lead to localised itching, weeping, pain and redness. Treatment-related side effects that caused modifications to the study or the withdrawal of participants occurred with imiquimod and MAL-PDT. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019.
This review of four trials found insufficient evidence to conclude whether supportive devices prevent subluxation or not and found no evidence to conclude whether supportive devices can reposition the head of humerus in the glenoid fossa of an already subluxed shoulder.
The review of trials found that when people with COPD and low levels of blood oxygen did this for the long term, their survival rates improved. However, it did not lengthen survival of people whose oxygen levels were only moderately low, or only low at night.
Data from some experimental and human studies have suggested that edaravone, a neuroprotective agent, may be beneficial for people with acute ischaemic stroke. It has been widely used in China to treat stroke. To obtain a reliable assessment of the effects of edaravone in acute ischaemic stroke, we reviewed data from three studies involving 496 participants. The quality of the trials was moderate. It would appear that edaravone is an effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. However, more high-quality and bigger sample trials are needed to confirm this result.
We wanted to find out if keeping the face-down position after vitrectomy and gas tamponade for macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is better than keeping the head in other positions. Keeping the head face-down may prevent such complications as large or small folds forming in the macula. These folds can affect sight. We also wanted to find out if face-down positioning has any harmful effects, such as neck problems. We searched for studies that compared keeping the head face-down after surgery with other head positions in people with macula-involving retinal detachments. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found three studies with a total of 368 people (369 eyes) with macula-involving retinal detachments. Study follow-up time varied, with the longest being six months. The results showed that some complications may be less frequent with face-down positioning, including retinal displacement (the retina 'landing' in a different position than where it was before it detached), retinal folds, and double vision. These complications may be very troublesome for people. Face-down positioning may increase the chance of high pressure in the eye; however, this can most often be successfully treated with eye drops. Face-down positioning did not seem to make any difference in the quantity of vision (reading letters in the chart) or quality of vision (how clearly people saw), or in quality of life. We have very low confidence in the evidence for face-down positioning after vitrectomy and gas tamponade for macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment because of the relatively small sample sizes and flawed study designs. The evidence is current to November 2022.
We sampled 43 studies from 26 countries for our analysis. Most studies were from low- or middle-income countries (33 studies) and included the perspectives of women and health workers. We downgraded our confidence in several findings from high confidence to moderate, low, or very-low confidence, mainly because we had concerns about how the studies were conducted (methodological limitations) or about missing important perspectives from some types of participants or in some settings (relevance).
In many communities, bleeding during and after childbirth is considered "normal" and necessary to expel "impurities" and restore and cleanse the woman's body after pregnancy and birth (moderate confidence). In some communities, people have misconceptions about causes of PPH, including that PPH is caused by supernatural powers or evil spirits that punish women for ignoring or disobeying social rules or for past mistakes (high confidence).
For women who give birth at home or in the community, female family members or traditional birth attendants are the first to recognise excess bleeding after birth (high confidence). Family members typically take the decision of whether and when to seek care if PPH is suspected, and these family members are often influenced by trusted traditional birth attendants or community midwives (high confidence). If PPH is identified for women birthing at home or in the community, decision-making about the subsequent referral and care pathway can be multi-faceted and complex (high confidence).
First responders to PPH are not always skilled or trained healthcare providers (high confidence). In health facilities, midwives may consider it easy to implement visual estimation of blood loss with a kidney dish or underpad, but difficult to accurately interpret the amount of blood loss (very low confidence). Quantifying (rather than estimating) blood loss may be a complex and contentious change of practice for health workers (low confidence). Women who gave birth in health facilities and experienced PPH described it as painful, embarrassing, and traumatic. Partners or other family members also found the experience stressful. While some women were dissatisfied with their level of involvement in decision-making for PPH management, others felt health workers were best placed to make these decisions (moderate confidence).
Inconsistent availability of resources (drugs, medical supplies, blood) cause delays in the timely management of PPH (high confidence). Health workers described working on the maternity ward as stressful and intense due to short staffing, long shifts, and the unpredictability of emergencies. Exhausted and overwhelmed staff may be unable to appropriately monitor all women, particularly when multiple women are giving birth simultaneously or on the floor of the health facility; this could lead to delays in detecting PPH (moderate confidence). Inadequate staffing, high turnover of skilled health workers, and appointment of lower-level cadres of health workers make it challenging to provide quality PPH care (high confidence).
Through team-based simulation training, health workers of different cadres (doctors, midwives, lay health workers) can develop a shared mental model to help them work quickly, efficiently, and amicably as a team when managing women with PPH (moderate confidence). We searched for studies published before 13 November 2022.
This review found that a single dose administered rectally was effective in relieving migraine headache pain and functional disability. Pain was reduced from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in approximately 2 in 5 people (41%) taking sumatriptan 25 mg, compared with about 1 in 6 (17%) taking placebo. Pain was reduced from moderate or severe to no worse than mild pain by two hours in roughly 2 in 3 people (71%) taking sumatriptan 25 mg, compared with approximately 1 in 3 (30%) taking placebo. In addition to relieving headache pain, sumatriptan 25 mg also relieved functional disability by two hours in about 2 in 5 people (41%), compared with about 1 in 6 (16%) taking placebo. There was not enough evidence to draw any conclusions about the incidence of adverse events or to compare rectal sumatriptan directly with any other active comparators.
Offering personally tailored activities may improve challenging behaviour and slightly improve quality of life of people with dementia living in their own homes, but may have little or no effect on depression, affect, passivity, and engagement (being involved in what is happening around them) of people with dementia. Personally tailored activities may slightly improve caregivers' distress, but may have little or no effect on caregiver burden, quality of life, and depression. No study looked for harmful effects and no study described that any harmful effects occurred. We concluded that offering activity sessions to people with mild to moderate dementia living in their own homes may help to manage challenging behaviour and may slightly improve their quality of life.
In the current systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of viral vaccines in these patients. The pre-defined primary outcome was incidence of the infection concerned. Secondary outcomes were mortality due to the viral infection, all-cause mortality, incidence of complications, incidence of severe viral infection, hospitalization rate, in vitro immune response and frequency of adverse effects. Eight RCTs were included. They evaluated heat-inactivated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (two trials), influenza vaccines (five trials) and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (one trial). There were no RCTs on other viral vaccines (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella). Only the two trials on VZV vaccine reported our pre-defined primary outcome. All trials reported some of the pre-defined secondary outcomes. We found that inactivated VZV vaccine might reduce the severity of herpes zoster when given before and after stem cell transplant in adults with lymphoma or leukemia. Inactivated influenza vaccine might reduce upper and lower respiratory infections and hospitalization in adults with multiple myeloma who are undergoing chemotherapy, or children with leukemia or lymphoma within two years post-chemotherapy. However, the quality of evidence is not high. Local adverse effects occur frequently with the vaccines, although serious adverse effects appear uncommon. Further high-quality RCTs are needed to clarify the benefits and optimal regimens of viral vaccines for patients with blood cancers.
We looked for studies that assessed MMR, MMRV or MMR+V vaccines, given in any dose or time schedule, compared with not giving the vaccine, or giving a placebo vaccine (a sham treatment), to healthy children up to 15 years old. Studies needed to measure the number of cases of measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox, and report whether children suffered any unwanted effects attributable to vaccination. We checked each study to make sure it used robust methods so that we could judge how reliable its results were. We found 138 studies with more than 23 million children. Fifty-one studies (10 million children) assessed how effective the vaccines were at preventing the diseases, and 87 studies (13 million children) assessed unwanted effects. In this 2020 update we have included 74 new studies published since 2012.Measles:results from seven studies (12,000 children) showed that one dose of vaccine was 95% effective in preventing measles. Seven per cent of unvaccinated children would catch measles and this number would fall to less than 0.5% of children who receive one dose of vaccine.Mumps:results from six studies (9915 children) showed that one dose of vaccine was 72% effective in preventing mumps. This rose to 86% after two doses, (3 studies, 7792 children). In unvaccinated children, 7.4% would catch mumps and this would fall to 1% if children were vaccinated with two doses.The results forrubella(1 study, 1621 children) andchickenpox(one study, 2279 children) also showed that vaccines are effective. After one dose, vaccination was 89% effective in preventing rubella, using a vaccine with the BRD2 strain which is only used in China, and after 10 years the MMRV vaccine was 95% effective at preventing chickenpox infection.Unwanted effectsOverall, the studies found that MMR, MMRV and MMR+V vaccines did not cause autism (2 studies 1,194,764 children), encephalitis (2 studies 1,071,088 children) or any other suspected unwanted effect.Our analyses showed very small risks of fits due to high temperature or fever (febrile seizures) around two weeks after vaccination, and of a condition where blood does not clot normally (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) in vaccinated children. Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence is slightly limited by the design of most of the studies. Nonetheless, we judged the certainty of the evidence for the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine to be moderate, and that for the varicella vaccine to be high. Our certainty in the evidence for autism and febrile seizures was also moderate. Our review shows that MMR, MMRV and MMR+V vaccines are effective in preventing the infection of children by measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox, with no evidence of an increased risk of autism or encephalitis and a small risk of febrile seizure. This review includes evidence published up to 2 May 2019.
We, a team of Cochrane researchers, searched widely through the medical literature and identified 42 relevant studies involving 1453 participants. The evidence is current to January 2015. The participants in these studies had some control of their affected arm and were generally able to open their affected hand by extending the wrist and fingers. CIMT treatments varied between studies in terms of the time for which the participants' unaffected arm was constrained each day, and the amount of active exercise that the affected arm was required to do. CIMT was compared mainly to active physiotherapy treatments, and sometimes to no treatment. The 42 studies assessed different aspects of recovery from stroke, and not all measured the same things. Eleven studies (with 344 participants) assessed the effect of CIMT on disability (the effective use of the arm in daily living) and found that the use of CIMT did not lead to improvement in ability to manage everyday activities such as bathing, dressing, eating, and toileting. Twenty-eight trials (with 858 participants) tested whether CIMT improved the ability to use the affected arm. CIMT appeared to be more effective at improving arm movement than active physiotherapy treatments or no treatment. The quality of the evidence for each outcome is limited due to small numbers of study participants and poor reporting of study details. We considered the quality of the evidence to be low for disability and very low for the ability to use the affected arm.
Seven randomized trials and 332 patients were included. Five of the seven trials were of parallel design. Five trials compared I.V. Iloprost and one trial studied p.o. Iloprost and another p.o. Cisaprost. Some trials were dose finding trials so various doses of Iloprost were used. Due to different efficacies of I.V. Iloprost, oral Iloprost and oral Cisaprost, the overall efficacy of these drugs was somewhat diluted. Intravenous Iloprost appears to be effective in the treatment of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.
Intravenous Iloprost is effective in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma at decreasing the frequency and severity of attacks and preventing or healing digital ulcers. The effect seems to be prolonged after the intravenous infusion is given. Oral Iloprost may have less efficacy than intravenous Iloprost. However, Cisaprost has minimal or no efficacy when given orally for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma.
The goal of this systematic review was to examine the effects of interferon treatment for interferon naive (previously untreated) patients with chronic hepatitis C. This review confirmed the efficacy of interferon on surrogate outcomes as well as a favourable effect of higher treatment doses and prolonged durations. However, these effects were associated with more adverse events. Compared with non-cirrhotic patients, cirrhotic patients respond similarly, but the efficacy of interferon in patients with normal liver biochemistry is not substantiated by the data. Although interferon monotherapy is no longer considered the standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C, this review defines the optimal dose and duration of interferon monotherapy, which may be useful for patients who cannot tolerate combination therapy including interferon and ribavirin, the most effective therapy currently available.
The evidence is current to December 2013. We included 11 studies involving 3060 randomly assigned participants at advanced stages of prostate cancer. The follow-up period of participants ranged from six months to six years. In seven studies, authors reported possible conflicts of interest. In three studies, no conflicts of interest were declared. In one study, authors reported that they had received an educational grant from the sponsor, who had no role in any aspect of analysis or data interpretation. Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens decreased overall survival and increased clinical progression and treatment failure. Subgroup analyses showed that non-steroidal antiandrogens, compared with castration, were less favourable for overall survival, for clinical progression and for treatment failure in men with metastatic disease. Participants receiving antiandrogens were also more likely to stop treatment as the result of side effects. The risk of suffering breast pain, enlargement of breast tissue or symptoms of physical weakness was also increased with non-steroidal antiandrogens. The risks of feeling intense heat with sweating and rapid heartbeat and of bleeding, the need to get up in the night to urinate, loss of sexual interest, extreme tiredness and the need to urinate more often than usual were increased with castration. No difference was noted for other side effects. The effect of non-steroidal antiandrogens on cancer-specific survival and biochemical progression remained unclear. Included studies were poorly conducted, and the quality of evidence was rated as moderate. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the accuracy of results.
We looked for randomised controlled trials to determine the effects of quetiapine for schizophrenia in comparison to placebo and other antipsychotics. We included results of ten short-term trials and two medium-term studies. Quetiapine is effective for the treatment of schizophrenia but not much different from first-generation antipsychotics and risperidone in the respects of treatment withdrawal and efficacy. In comparison to typical antipsychotics and risperidone, it has a lower risk of movement disorders but higher risks of dizziness, dry mouth and sleepiness.
We performed a comprehensive literature search on 5 November 2018 for all randomised controlled trials addressing this review question. We found no randomised controlled trials on this topic. We were unable to assess the quality of evidence because of the absence of studies included in this review. Randomised controlled trials are needed to provide solid evidence on this topic. Evidence from non-randomised studies with large sample sizes would also be helpful in guiding clinical practice.
This review demonstrated improvements on a range of measures with the combined treatment. In the absence of significant side effects, injection of BoNT-A has been identified as a safe and effective treatment for upper limb spasticity when used in combination with occupational therapy in children with cerebral palsy.
The review authors assessed the effect of these medicines on pain and their side effects. Based on 5 out of 11 included trials there were some beneficial effects of antipsychotics in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Analysis of these studies showed a significant reduction in pain after administration of the antipsychotic compared to placebo or another medicine, however these results were based on small studies and therefore they may be unreliable. It is also important to consider the unwanted effects that these medicines might cause.
We searched nine medical research databases and two trials registries for randomized controlled trials, and one website for gray literature (i.e. research produced by organizations outside the traditional commercial and academic publishing and distribution channels).
We considered randomized and non-randomized studies comparing progestin-containing IUDs with copper-containing IUDs, or oral EC methods for emergency contraception.
We screened all abstracts identified in our search, and the full text of potential reports. We assessed the risk of bias and used the GRADE system to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. We identified 2828 records. After removing duplicates and applying inclusion criteria, we identified one randomized controlled study that met our criteria. It included 711 women, and compared LNG-IUDs to Cu-IUDs for EC. There may be little or no difference in pregnancy rates at one month between LNG-IUD and Cu-IUD users, but we are very uncertain about the evidence. Evidence was also very uncertain about whether the risk of a failed insertion was different for the two types of IUDs.
The evidence is very uncertain about the comparative acceptability of the two types of IUDs for EC. Regarding outcomes related to harms, low-certainty evidence suggests that the copper IUD may increase cramping, while the LNG-IUD may increase the number of days with bleeding and spotting. The current evidence does not provide definitive evidence on the effectiveness of LNG-IUD for EC.
More comparative studies are needed to see if the LNG-IUD is as effective as the Cu-IUD for EC. The evidence is current to July 2022.
The evidence was current as of June 2015. We identified six RCTs, which had enrolled 1088 patients. The studies took quite different approaches to their investigations, and we found only one study that had explored the duration of antibiotic therapy for ICU patients who had HAP, but were not mechanically ventilated. For patients with VAP, our main finding was that a course of seven or eight days of antibiotics was associated with an overall decrease in antibiotic administration and reduced the recurrence of pneumonia due to resistant organisms when compared with a 10- to 15-day course. Furthermore, this was achieved without any significant effect on mortality. Nevertheless, in cases when VAP was due to a particular type of organism ('non-fermenting Gram-negative bacillus'), which can be difficult to eradicate with antibiotics, the risk of pneumonia recurring appeared higher after a short course of treatment.
One study found that for patients with possible (but low probability) HAP a short (three-day) course of therapy seemed to be associated with a lower chance of acquiring resistant organisms or of subsequent infections being due to a resistant organism. The quality of evidence for the main outcome measures was low to moderate. The main reasons that the quality was not high were that only a small number of studies were identified, and that there were differences in patient populations, in the nature of the interventions between studies and in the reported outcomes.
We reviewed studies retrievable as of July 2014. We included four prospective controlled studies of previously healthy children under 18 years of age who attended an ED of an urgent care clinic because of fever and respiratory symptoms. Based on these four studies, involving 759 study participants, we found that in previously healthy children coming to the ED with fever and respiratory symptoms, a rapid viral test showed a trend towards fewer antibiotic prescriptions, but this finding was not statistically significant. However, we found that rapid viral testing reduces the use of chest X-rays. There are also blood and urine investigations that can be undertaken. The true impact of this intervention on the frequency of blood and urine testing, as well as the length of the ED visit, requires trials with larger numbers of children. None of the included studies reported harm or adverse events related to the intervention tested. The quality of the evidence was considered moderate with regard to risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias and inconsistency. While none of the studies used blinding, the impact of the use of rapid viral testing is in its ability to provide diagnostic information. Blinding of this interventions to the clinician would be impossible and make the intervention useless.
Certain drugs might prevent this damage, but for many of these drugs, the review authors found no high quality evidence about whether they were effective in protecting the heart and they were unable to draw conclusions. For dexrazoxane, the review authors found 10 studies enrolling over 1600 patients. These studies provided evidence that dexrazoxane prevented heart damage without interfering with the anti-tumour effects of anthracycline treatment. Patients who got dexrazoxane with their anthracycline treatment had about one third of the risk of heart failure compared to patients who got anthracyclines without dexrazoxane. Dexrazoxane had no effect on survival. We can't be sure about whether it had any undesirable side effects.
This review aimed to evaluate pure self-help (PSH) and guided self-help (GSH) interventions for eating disorders for all ages and genders, compared to psychological, pharmacological or control treatments and waiting list. Fifteen trials were identified, all focused on BN, BED or EDNOS, using manual-based self-help. There is some evidence that PSH/GSH reduce eating disorder and other symptoms in comparison to waiting list or control treatment and may produce comparable outcomes to formal therapist-delivered psychological therapies. PSH/GSH may have some utility as a first step in treatment. In the future there need to be large well-conducted effectiveness studies of self-help treatments with or without guidance incorporating cost evaluations and investigation of different types of self-help in different populations and settings.
We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for these conditions. Four randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in this review, involving 294 patients. Three investigated electro-acupuncture for TBI while one investigated acupuncture for acute TBI. The studies were of low methodological quality and were diverse in their objectives, participant characteristics, acupuncture modalities and strategies, and outcome measures. The small number of studies together with their low methodological quality means that they are inadequate to allow any conclusion to be drawn about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of TBI. Further methodologically robust studies are needed to generate evidence-based conclusions.
The review of one small trial found that apnea might be reduced in the first few days after treatment, but there were not enough infants studied to know if this was a significant effect. There is no evidence from this trial on longer term effects or less common adverse effects. More research is needed on the effectiveness, potential harm and long-term benefits or adverse effects of these drugs.
We included nine randomised controlled trials involving 2391 women and their babies in this review. The trials were of moderate quality overall. All trials compared giving women a high dose versus a low dose of oxytocin for induction of labour. We found that women who had a high dose of oxytocin were not more likely to have a shorter induction to delivery interval or have a vaginal birth within 24 hours of receiving the treatment than women receiving a low dose of oxytocin. When poor-quality trials are removed from analysis however, the induction to delivery interval was significantly shorter with high-dose oxytocin compared to low-dose oxytocin. The likelihood of having a caesarean was similar with the different doses of oxytocin for induction of labour. No differences were shown between the two groups of women in terms of serious complications, including death of the mother or her baby but women receiving the high-dose oxytocin did have an increased risk of excessive uterine contractions (known as uterine hyperstimulation). No trials provided any information about the number of women with uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the babies' heart rate. Similarly, no trials assessed satisfaction of the mother or her caregivers.
The trials were at moderate to high risk of bias overall. The definition of high- and low-dose protocols and the outcomes measured varied considerably across the trials. The current evidence is not strong enough to recommend high-dose over low-dose regimens for routine induction of labour. We recommend that further research is carried out.
In this review, we included three studies that investigated effects of aripiprazole. Two were short-term (eight weeks) studies that evaluated whether aripiprazole improved behavioural problems in a total of 316 children/adolescents. The third was a longer-term (up to 16 weeks) study in which 85 children/adolescents whose symptoms initially improved on aripiprazole discontinued the medication to evaluate whether their behavioural problems recurred. All participants were between six and 17 years of age. All studies used multiple behavioural checklists to assess symptoms of ASD. Short-term studies found improved irritability, hyperactivity and stereotypy (i.e. repetitive behaviours) and inappropriate speech in children/adolescents with ASD taking aripiprazole as compared with placebo. Researchers found no improvement in lethargy/withdrawal (i.e. lack of energy and reduced alertness). White children/adolescents were less likely to relapse (return to older, problematic behaviours) when taking aripiprazole, but this finding was not reported in children/adolescents of other races. Rates of movement disorder side effects such as tremor, muscle rigidity and involuntary movement were higher in children/adolescents taking aripiprazole in all trials. Results of this review suggest that short-term use of aripiprazole may improve irritability, hyperactivity and repetitive movements in children/adolescents with ASD, although both weight gain and neurological side effects (e.g. involuntary movements of the face and jaw) can occur. Children and adolescents taking aripiprazole should be re-evaluated periodically to monitor improvements in ASD symptoms and side effects. Overall, the quality of this evidence is moderate. Since the time these studies were conducted, an updated version of the manual for diagnosing ASD and other conditions has been published. Additional studies evaluating safety and benefits of long-term use of aripiprazole would be helpful.
Twenty-six trials presented sufficient data to be included in meta-analysis. There is some evidence from methodologically weak trials to indicate that some physiotherapy interventions are effective for some specific shoulder disorders. The results overall provide little evidence to guide treatment. There is a clear need for further high quality trials of physiotherapy interventions, including trials using combinations of modalities, in the treatment of shoulder disorders.
The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 22 July 2013. The only study included was based in rural areas of the city of Trivandrum in Kerala, India. The study included 191,873 apparently healthy adults aged 35 years or older living in 13 clusters with an average of 14,759 participants in each cluster. Screening took place in seven clusters (96,517 participants) and six clusters acted as a control (95,356 participants). Participants were excluded if they were bedridden, if they had open tuberculosis, other debilitating diseases or were already suffering from oral cancer.
Healthcare workers trained in the detection of oral lesions undertook the screening of participants and the social history of participants including use of paan, tobacco, alcohol and dietary supplements was recorded. The review found that overall there is not enough evidence to decide whether screening by visual inspection reduces the death rate for oral cancer and there is no evidence for other screening methods. However, there is some evidence that it might help reduce death rates in patients who use tobacco and alcohol although the only included study may be affected by bias. The evidence presented is of low quality and limited to one study assessed as at high risk of bias.
The evidence is current to September 2020. We included seven clinical trials with 2185 participants aged two to 77 years. The included studies had different treatment periods of 12 to 18 weeks. All seven trials were randomized controlled trials, which means that people were randomly divided into groups and compared. This review found that eslicarbazepine acetate was effective when used in combination with other medicines to reduce the number of seizures in adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Eslicarbazepine acetate may also be effective in reducing seizure frequency in children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. People who took eslicarbazepine acetate were more likely to have no seizures compared to people who took a placebo (a pretend tablet), but they were more likely to stop taking eslicarbazepine acetate because of side effects. These included dizziness, nausea (feeling sick), somnolence (feeling sleepy), vomiting (being sick) and diplopia (having double vision). Altogether the seven trials used good methods, but information was missing from the trials for between 10% and 45% of people taking the medicine in five trials of adults. This missing information may have introduced uncertainty into the results so the evidence in this review is of moderate quality. More research is needed to look at the long-term effects of eslicarbazepine acetate and to explore how well it works in children with epilepsy.
In short-term studies, oral paliperidone is a more effective antipsychotic than placebo. The adverse effects of paliperidone are similar to those of risperidone. No data comparing the efficacy of paliperidone to risperidone over a meaningful period of time was available for this review; in a six-day trial comparing paliperidone to risperidone we identified no difference in recurrence of psychotic symptoms or adverse effects. The manufacturer is also developing an intramuscular long-acting formulation, but it is not yet commercially available; its use in the treatment of schizophrenia will be considered in a separate review.
At this stage, there is not enough evidence to support the use of LNG-IUD after surgery to reduce pain caused by endometriosis.  Although there was some evidence of a benefit in reducing painful periods and improving quality of life and satisfaction when using LNG-IUD after surgery, the certainty of evidence was low to very low, due to the small numbers of studies and study participants, as well as flaws in study design. This suggests that further studies are required before a recommendation can be made for its use.
The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate ophthalmology trainee population. VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR-trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence-based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications. The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021.
We found 16 studies with 9549 people. About 4532 people received corticosteroids, mostly dexamethasone (3766 people). These studies included participants mostly older than 50 years, male, and from high-income countries.
We also found 42 ongoing and 23 completed studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design. Eleven studies compared corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without a placebo. Only one study compared two types of corticosteroids. Four studies compared different dosing of a corticosteroid named dexamethasone. The studies included only hospitalised people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. No studies looked at non-hospitalised people or different timing of treatment. • probably reduce the number of deaths from any cause slightly, up to 30 days after treatment;
• may slightly increase the chance of being discharged alive from hospital and may slightly decrease the risk of needing breathing support or dying;
• we don't know if corticosteroids increase or decrease the number of deaths from any cause up to 120 days after treatment, any unwanted effects, or infections caught in the hospital. The evidence for the number of deaths up to 30 days is very uncertain (one small study only). High-dose dexamethasone:
• may reduce the number of deaths from any cause up to 30 days after treatment;
• may make little to no difference to the chance of being discharged alive from hospital;
• we don't know if high-dose dexamethasone increases or decreases the number of deaths from any cause up to 120 days after treatment, any unwanted effects, or infections caught in the hospital. We examined the following equity-related aspects: ethnicity (Black, Asian or other versus White versus unknown) and place of residence (high-income versus low- and middle-income countries). For most of the subgroups, except for age and ethnicity, no evidence for differences could be identified. For death from any cause up to 30 days, participants younger than 70 years seem to benefit from corticosteroids in contrast to participants who were aged 70 years and older. Furthermore, the few participants from a Black, Asian, or minority ethnic group had a larger estimated effect than the many White participants, but these subgroup results need cautious interpretation. We are moderately confident in the evidence about the effect of corticosteroids on deaths from any cause within 30 days after treatment. However, our confidence in the other evidence is low to very low, because studies did not use the most robust methods, and the way results were recorded and reported differed across studies. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up-to-date to 6 January 2022.
In May 2017 we searched for all clinical trials that investigated the effectiveness of trihexyphenidyl for people with dystonic cerebral palsy. We included one Australian trial that involved 16 children (10 boys, 6 girls) with cerebral palsy and dystonia. They had an average age of nine years.
The children were divided into two different groups. Both groups took 12 weeks of trihexyphenidyl and 12 weeks of a placebo (something that looks the same as trihexyphenidyl but with no active ingredient), with a 4-week break in between during which they received neither. The only difference between the groups was that one group started with trihexyphenidyl and then had placebo, and the other group started with placebo and then had trihexyphenidyl. We found no evidence that trihexyphenidyl was effective for reducing dystonia or improving upper arm function in children with cerebral palsy and dystonia. Trihexyphenidyl may be associated with an increased risk of side effects (agitation, constipation, dry mouth and poor sleep). There was some evidence that trihexyphenidyl may improve individual goals set by the child and family around improved participation in activities of daily living. The study did not measure pain or quality of life. We rated the quality of the evidence as low because the one study included a small number of children and there are no other studies to support the findings. Therefore, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of trihexyphenidyl in reducing dystonia or improving arm function and participation in everyday activities of people with cerebral palsy and dystonia.
We included all randomised controlled trials that compared adjustment of asthma medications by either usual clinical care (control group) versus using exhaled nitric oxide. The participants included in the trials had asthma diagnosed as per relevant asthma guidelines.
The evidence is current to June 2016 when the searches were last completed.
The review included nine studies (involving 1426 children) that varied in a several ways including length of the study, exhaled nitric oxide cut-off levels used for altering medicines and the way each study defined flare-ups or attacks (called exacerbations). The studies ranged from 6 to 12 months in length. The exhaled nitric oxide cut-off values used by the different studies as a basis for decreasing or increasing medicines also varied.
The mean age of the participants ranged from 10 to 14 years old. In this review, we found that guiding asthma medicines based on exhaled nitric oxide (compared to a control group) was beneficial in reducing the number of children who had at least one exacerbation during the study. In the control group where therapy was guided according to clinical symptoms, 40 children out of 100 had at least one exacerbation over 48.5 weeks, compared to 28 out of 100 children where treatment was guided by exhaled nitric oxide. However, we found no difference between groups in other measures of asthma severity that impact on day-to-day clinical symptoms or inhaled corticosteroid dose (medications used to control asthma). Therefore, using exhaled nitric oxide levels to adjust asthma therapy may reduce the number of attacks that children with asthma have but does not impact on the day-to-day symptoms. The level of evidence found ranged from moderate, when comparing the two groups for the number of children who had one or more exacerbations, to very low when comparing the number of exacerbations.
This review included 12 trials (2918 participants) and we were able to combine the data from nine trials with a total of 2637 participants (current to April 2020). Almost half of the participants were randomly assigned to wearing stockings for a flight lasting at least five hours while the other half did not wear stockings.
None of the passengers developed a DVT with symptoms (slowly developing leg pain, swelling and increased temperature) and no serious events (a blood clot in their lungs (pulmonary embolism) or dying) were reported. Passengers were carefully assessed after the flight to detect any problems with the circulation of blood in their legs, even if they had not noticed any problems themselves. Wearing compression stockings resulted in a large reduction in symptomless DVT among airline passengers who were allocated to wear compression stockings compared to those allocated not to wear compression stockings. This difference in symptomless DVT between the two groups is equivalent to a reduction in the risk from a few tens per thousand passengers to two or three per thousand. People who wore stockings had less swelling in their legs (oedema) than those who did not wear them. Fewer passengers developed superficial vein thrombosis when wearing compression stockings than those not wearing stockings. Not all the trials reported on possible problems with wearing stockings but in those that did, the researchers said that the stockings were well-tolerated, without any problems. High-certainty evidence shows that airline passengers wearing compression stockings develop less symptomless DVT and low-certainty evidence shows that leg swelling is reduced when compared to not wearing compression stockings. Our certainty in the evidence was limited by the way that swelling was measured. There is moderate-certainty evidence that superficial vein thrombosis may be reduced in passengers who wear compression stockings. We cannot assess the effect of wearing stockings on death, pulmonary embolism or symptomatic DVT because no such events occurred in these trials. Randomised trials to assess these outcomes would need to include a very large number of people.
In the trials treating otitis media, the quality of the evidence was moderate as the methods for avoiding bias were not clearly stated. Furthermore, in one trial a pharmaceutical company prepared the placebo syrup used in the trial.
In the study treating pneumonia, we classified the quality of the evidence as moderate, because the families previously knew if their children were receiving antibiotics or not. Furthermore, the methods for avoiding bias were not clearly stated by the trial authors.
Further high-quality research is needed to provide more definitive evidence of the effectiveness of antibiotics in this population.
In August 2017, we updated our searches for clinical trials in which SNRIs were used to treat symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults. We found eight new studies since the previous version of the review. In total, we found 18 studies with 7903 participants. The studies were four to 27 weeks long and compared the SNRIs desvenlafaxine, duloxetine and milnacipran against a fake medication (placebo). We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Duloxetine and milnacipran were better than placebo in reducing pain by 50% or more and in improving global well-being (low-quality evidence). Duloxetine and milnacipran were better than placebo in improving health-related quality of life and in reducing fatigue (low-quality evidence). Duloxetine and milnacipran were not better than placebo in reducing sleep problems (low-quality evidence). More people dropped out of the trial due to side effects with duloxetine and milnacipran than with placebo (low-quality evidence). More people reported nausea and drowsiness with duloxetine and milnacipran than with placebo (low-quality evidence). Duloxetine, milnacipran and placebo did not differ in the frequency of serious side effects experienced (very low-quality evidence).
We found two research studies that had assessed yoga for stroke survivors. Seventy-two people took part in the two studies. One study was in the USA and one was in Australia. On average, the stroke survivors were between 60 and 63 years old and it had been between four years three months and nine years since they had had a stroke. In the American study, yoga classes were held twice a week for eight weeks. In the Australian study, yoga classes were held once a week for 10 weeks. Both studies encouraged people to practice yoga at home, in their own time. Both studies used waiting-list control groups. This means that people in the control group could go to yoga classes at the end of the study. The American study was funded by the US Government. The Austrailian study was funded by the National Stroke Foundation (Australia). We were able to analyse study data from 69 participants. No significant benefit was found on measures of QoL, balance, strength, endurance, pain, disability scores. No significant benefit was found on measures of movement, although one study reported a significant benefit in improving aspects of range of movement. One study reported a significant benefit in reducing anxiety. Neither study reported on measures of patient harm. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low, due to the small number of trials included in the review, both of which we judged to be at high risk of bias, particularly in relation to incompleteness of data and selective reporting, and especially regarding the representative nature of the sample in one study. The review could not identify enough high-quality evidence on the benefits and safety of yoga in stroke rehabilitation. More good-quality research studies are needed to be sure that yoga has benefits for stroke survivors.
Six family practice studies including over 6,600 back pain patients found 21 tumors (0.3%).  One study on back pain diagnosed in an emergency room and one on back pain in a spine clinic included 482 and 257 patients.  The family practice studies described 15 different questions and physical exam tests that have been used to screen for spinal tumors.  Most of the 15 were not accurate.  A previous history of cancer is a very useful indicator.  Other facts that may indicate cancer are age greater than 50, no prior history of back pain, and failure to improve after one month.  These are most likely useful when combined, or with other indicators such as a history of cancer.  By themselves, these three questions would result in over-testing of patients without cancer.
The worst effects of low quality red flag screening are overtreatment and undertreatment.  If the tests are not accurate, patients without a tumor may get an x-ray, MRI, bone scan or CT scan that they don’t need—unnecessary exposure to x-rays, extra worry for the patient and extra cost.  At the other extreme (and much less common), it might be possible to miss a real tumor, and cause the patient to have extra time without the best treatment.
Most of the studies were of low or moderate quality and did not use an MRI, the most accurate imaging test, to confirm the presence or absence of a tumor, so more research is needed to identify the best combination of questions and examination methods.
The review included 21 studies that reported clinical outcomes in very preterm or low birth weight infants. Reporting was incomplete for all outcomes. Searches for studies were conducted in June 2017. Higher amino acid intake did not affect survival in preterm or low birth weight infants. Not enough information is available to determine whether this had an effect on neurodevelopment. Higher amino acid intake was associated with lower rates of growth failure, increased head growth, and fewer premature eye problems (eye problems were not severe). Higher amino acid intake was also associated with increased levels of protein breakdown products (urea) and a lower incidence of high blood glucose levels. Higher amino acid intake did not affect survival but reduced the incidence of growth failure up to the time of hospital discharge. Higher amino acid intake may produce other effects, including an increase in head growth and a reduction in eye problems (retinopathy of prematurity), although these effects are uncertain. Evidence suggests that high amino acid intake may not be tolerated by all infants. Further research is needed to determine the optimal amino acid intake for parenteral nutrition and nutritional balance in preterm infants. Low-quality evidence suggests that higher AA intake in parenteral nutrition does not affect mortality. Very low-quality evidence suggests that higher AA intake reduces the incidence of postnatal growth failure, and that higher AA intake reduces retinopathy of prematurity, but not severe retinopathy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether higher AA intake had an effect on neurodevelopment.
This review examines the benefits and costs of outreach in a range of specialties and in a variety of settings. Simple 'shifted outpatients' styles of specialist outreach were shown to improve access, but there was no evidence of their impact on health outcomes. Outreach as part of more complex multifaceted interventions involving primary care collaborations, education and other services was associated with improved health outcomes, more efficient and guideline-consistent care, and less use of inpatient services. There is a need for better quality evidence evaluating specialist outreach in all settings, but especially in rural and disadvantaged populations.
This review examines evidence for this possibility. Switching antipsychotic medication did show some reduction in weight and also contributed broader health benefits such as reducing fasting blood glucose. Notably, there were no significant difference in outcomes of mental state, global state and adverse events between groups which switched medications and those that remained on previous medication.
We searched differing databases of published research for all papers relating to the accuracy of IQCODE for detecting dementia. We found only one study that tested diagnostic accuracy of IQCODE in a primary care/general practice setting. The study was of a select population (Japanese Americans) and the results may not be applicable to patients in other countries. We also noted issues in the study methods used and the reported results. Based on this single study we are unable to give guidance on how well IQCODE may function as a dementia assessment in primary care. More research is needed in this area as many patients with memory or thinking problems will first consult their general practitioner / family doctor.
We included 16 new studies in this update, so the evidence in this review now rests on 26 studies with a total number of 1165 participants. The studies examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy interventions (three days to eight months) for autistic children, youth, and young adults in one-to-one or group settings. None of the studies reported funding by an agency with a commercial interest in the result of the studies; reported sources of support included governmental, university and foundation funding; in three studies, support was provided by a music therapy association. Music therapy compared with 'placebo' therapy or standard care probably increases the chance of overall improvement by the end of therapy, likely improves quality of life and total autism symptom severity immediately after therapy, and probably does not increase adverse events. From the available evidence, we cannot tell whether music therapy has any effects on social interaction, and verbal and non-verbal communication at the end of therapy. The evidence we found in this review is of very low to moderate certainty. This means that future research may change these findings and our confidence in them. We found that music therapy is probably effective regarding global improvement, quality of life, total autism symptom severity and adverse events measured at the end of therapy based on the moderate certainty of the evidence in these domains. It remains unclear whether music therapy has an effect on social interaction, non-verbal communication and verbal communication at the end of therapy since the certainty of evidence was low to very low. Reasons for limited certainty of the evidence were issues with study design and blinding (i.e. those who applied outcome measures often knew whether or not participants had received music therapy, which may have influenced their assessments). Music therapy compared with 'placebo' therapy or standard care probably increases the chance of overall improvement by the end of therapy. It also probably helps to enhance quality of life, and lessen symptom severity. Music therapy probably does not increase adverse events. We cannot tell whether music therapy may help with social interaction, non-verbal communication and verbal communication at the end of therapy. Most of the included studies featured interventions that correspond well with music therapy in clinical practice concerning methods and settings. This new evidence is important for autistic people and their families as well as for policymakers, service providers and clinicians, to help in decisions around what intervention to choose, and in the planning of resources. More research with adequate design (i.e. producing reliable evidence) looking at areas that matter to autistic people is needed. Because long-term outcomes of therapy matter to autistic people and their families, it is important to specifically examine how long the effects of music therapy last.
Sixteen trials involving 3689 participants were included in this review and compared day hospitals with other comprehensive services (including inpatient and outpatient services), home based care and no comprehensive services. Attendance at a day hospital offers benefits compared to providing no treatment which include reducing the risk of needing more help with daily activities such as washing or dressing. Furthermore, patients are less likely to suffer one of the following: dying, being institutionalised or becoming more dependent on others. There is no apparent benefit when day hospitals are compared with other comprehensive services or home care. The economic value of day hospitals when compared with other health care services remains unclear.
This review includes 13 randomized trials with a total of 1211 participants. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine were found to be possibly more effective than placebo (fake medicine) for inducing remission in Crohn's disease. There is evidence to suggest that the combination of azathioprine and infliximab is superior to infliximab used as a single drug for induction of steroid-free remission in active Crohn's disease. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha blocking drugs like infliximab may provide an alternative treatment for patients who do not respond to corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drug treatment. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine may reduce the need for steroid treatment and their use may therefore lead to a lower incidence of steroid related side effects. However, these drugs are slow acting and are associated with some rare, but serious side effects. In some patients they suppress formation of blood cells that fight off infection and allow blood to clot and they occasionally cause inflammation of the pancreas. These drugs have also been associated with an increased risk of lymphoma. For these reasons careful consideration needs to be given to the use of these drugs in patients with active Crohn's disease.
We wanted to find out about the risks and benefits of using topical azoles to treat otomycosis. We searched for studies that compared topical azole treatment against:
- a placebo (dummy) treatment;
- no treatment; or
- other azole treatments.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found four studies that involved 559 people from Spain, Mexico and India. Three studies included children and adults, and one included only adults.
The studies compared:
- the topical azole 'clotrimazole' against a different topical azole (eberconazole, fluconazole or miconazole; three studies); and
- the topical azole 'bifonazole' as a cream against bifonazole drops (one study).
No studies compared topical azoles against a placebo or no treatment.
Clotrimazole compared against other topical azoles
The evidence suggests that, 24 days after the start of the treatment, there may be little to no difference between clotrimazole and other topical azoles in:
- the number of people whose ears were no longer infected with fungi;
- the number of severe adverse (unwanted) effects, such as severe allergic reactions;
- the number of non-severe unwanted effects.
The evidence is not robust enough for us to determine if clotrimazole:
- is better than other topical azoles for ending otomycosis.
Bifonazole cream compared against bifonazole drops
The evidence is not robust enough for us to compare the benefits and risks of bifonazole cream against bifonazole drops. The main limitations of the evidence are that it relies on few studies that:
- sometimes have conflicting results;
- are conducted in a few countries only; and
- are conducted in ways that may have introduced errors into their results. The evidence is up to date to November 2020.
Twenty-two randomised controlled trials, including a total of 3703 women, met the inclusion criteria of this review. Most women had a type of infertility known as unexplained infertility, which means that after all routine tests were done, there was no obvious explanation for why the couple had not become pregnant so far. The main outcomes of the review were live birth/ongoing pregnancy (pregnancy beyond 12 weeks) and pain experienced during the procedure. The evidence is current to 21 May 2020. Only one trial comparing intentional endometrial injury with no injury/a placebo procedure was well designed and was included in the analysis. This study did not provide enough evidence to show whether there is a difference in the chance of live birth; the quality of the evidence was low. Evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth with no intervention/a placebo procedure is assumed to be 34%, then the chance with endometrial injury would be 27% to 55%.
Six studies reported on whether women experienced pain during the procedure and most often reported mild to moderate pain.
Four trials compared endometrial injury performed in the cycle before IUI to such injury performed in the same cycle as IUI. Live birth/ongoing pregnancy or pain during the procedure was not reported.
One trial compared endometrial injury performed early in the first half of the menstrual cycle (Day 2 to 4) to endometrial injury performed late in the first half of the menstrual cycle (Day 7 to 9), both in the same cycle as IUI. Live birth/ongoing pregnancy was not reported. This study reported pain assessed by a zero-to-ten visual scale, where 0 is pain-free and 10 is unbearable pain, and showed that the pain score on average was 0.17 points lower after endometrial injury early in the first half of the menstrual cycle compared to such injury late in the first half of the menstrual cycle. There remains uncertainty about whether or not the endometrial injury procedure increases the probability of having a baby. Furthermore, no conclusions could be drawn about whether timing of endometrial injury affects the probability of having a baby. The quality of the evidence was assessed as low to very low. The reason for this is that the studies included in this review were not very well designed and did not recruit a large enough number of women to provide meaningful results. This means that results must be treated cautiously, and further studies are needed to confirm findings. Current evidence is insufficient to support routine use of endometrial injury in women undergoing IUI or attempting to conceive via sexual intercourse.
The researchers identified 11 studies that included a total of 881 participants. Seven studies including 532 participants compared azathioprine to a placebo (a fake medicine such as a sugar pill). Two studies including 166 participants compared azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to aminosalicylates (the anti-inflammatory medications mesalazine or sulfasalazine). One study including 77 participants compared azathioprine to budesonide (a steroid drug). One study including 31 participants compared 6-mercaptopurine to methotrexate (an immunosuppressive drug). One study including 36 participants compared combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab (a biologic drug) to infliximab alone. One study with 147 participants compared the early use of azathioprine in patients with recently diagnosed Crohn's disease to a conventional management strategy. Two studies were rated as high quality. Three studies were rated as low quality. Six studies were rated as unclear quality due to a lack of information.
A pooled analysis of six studies (489 participants) suggests that azathioprine (at daily doses of 1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) is superior to placebo for maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease over a 6 to 18 month period. A pooled analysis of two studies (166 participants) showed no difference in the proportion of patients who maintained remission between azathioprine (1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) or 6-mercaptopurine (1.0 mg/day) and aminosalicylate therapy (mesalazine 3 g/day or sulfasalazine 0.5g/15 kg/day). One small study (77 participants) suggests that azathioprine (2.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) may be superior to budesonide (6 to 9 mg/day) for maintenance of remission over a one year period. One small study (36 participants) found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between combination therapy with azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg/day) and infliximab (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks) compared to infliximab alone. One small study (31 participants) found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between 6-mercaptopurine (1 mg/day) and methotrexate (10 mg/week). One study (147 participants) failed to show any difference in time spent in remission between early azathioprine treatment and a conventional management strategy. An increased risk of side effects was seen in participants who received azathioprine. Some of these side effects such as leukopenia (a reduction in the number of white cells in the blood) were serious in nature. Common side effects included pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), leukopenia, nausea, allergic reaction and infection. The choice to use azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine should be made after careful consideration of the risks and benefits of using these drugs. More research is needed to allow conclusions about the comparative effectiveness and side effects of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine compared to other maintenance therapies such as methotrexate. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and side effects of the use of azathioprine with infliximab and other biologics and to determine the optimal management strategy for patients with inactive Crohn's disease.
In this systematic review, we tried to compare the effect of treatment regimens used for GvHD in the absence and presence of corticosteroids, or with different doses of corticosteroids. After searching relevant sources, we located only two studies that met our criteria to be included in the study. Their results are described in detail in the text of the review. In brief, these studies are in favor earlier remission and slightly better outcome in patients but more evidence is needed in this field.
The evidence is current to February 2018. We searched the medical literature and identified 69 relevant studies with 30,020 critically ill participants who were given fluid replacement in hospital or in an emergency out-of-hospital setting. Studies compared colloids (starches; dextrans; gelatins; or albumin or FFP) with crystalloids. We found moderate-certainty evidence that using colloids (starches; dextrans; or albumin or FFP) compared to crystalloids for fluid replacement probably makes little or no difference to the number of critically ill people who die within 30 or 90 days, or by the end of study follow-up. We also found low-certainty evidence that using gelatins or crystalloids may make little or no difference to the number of deaths within each of these time points.
We found moderate-certainty evidence that using starches probably slightly increases the need for blood transfusion. However, we are uncertain whether using other types of colloids, compared to crystalloids, makes a difference to whether people need a blood transfusion because the certainty of the evidence is very low.
We found moderate-certainty evidence that using starches for fluid replacement probably slightly increases the need for renal replacement therapy. Using albumin or FFP compared to crystalloids may make little or no difference to the need for renal replacement therapy. One study comparing gelatins did not report results for renal replacement therapy according to the type of fluid given, and no studies comparing dextrans assessed renal replacement therapy.
Few studies reported adverse events (specifically, allergic reactions, itching, or rashes), so we are uncertain whether either fluid type causes fewer adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). We found little or no difference between starches or crystalloids in allergic reactions, but fewer participants given crystalloids reported itching or rashes. We found little or no difference in allergic reactions for the use of dextrans (four studies), gelatins (one study), and albumin or FFP (one study). Some study authors did not report study methods clearly and many did not register their studies before they started, so we could not be certain whether the study outcomes were decided before or after they saw the results. Also, we found that some people who were given crystalloids may also have had colloids, which might have affected the results. For some outcomes, we had very few studies, which reduced our confidence in the evidence. Using colloids (starches; dextrans; or albumin or FFP) compared to crystalloids for fluid replacement probably makes little or no difference to the number of critically ill people who die. It may make little or no difference to the number of people who die if gelatins or crystalloids are used for fluid replacement.
Starches probably increase the need for blood transfusion and renal replacement therapy slightly. Using albumin or FFP may make little or no difference to the need for renal replacement therapy. We are uncertain whether using dextrans, albumin or FFP, or crystalloids affects the need for blood transfusion. Similarly, we are uncertain if colloids or crystalloids increase the number of adverse events. Results from ongoing studies may increase our confidence in the evidence in future.
We wanted to find out whether combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation compared with mechanical or oral antibiotic preparation alone or no bowel preparation has an effect on:
- the occurrence of surgical site infections
- the occurrence of anastomotic leakages
In addition, we wanted to find out whether combined bowel preparation had an effect on mortality, the occurrence of mild or severe postoperative complications, the likelihood of postoperative ileus (bowel motility disorder) or the length of hospital stay. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether side effects of the bowel preparation interventions differ between combination therapy and sole mechanical, sole oral antibiotic, or no bowel preparation. We searched for studies comparing combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with sole mechanical, sole oral antibiotic, or no bowel preparation in patients scheduled for colon or rectal resection.We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 21 studies in which patients scheduled for colon or rectal resection were assigned either to a group receiving combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation or to a comparison group. The comparison group received mechanical bowel preparation alone in 17 studies, oral antibiotics alone in three studies, and no bowel preparation at all in one study. All participants received intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis during surgery. The studies included a total of 5968 participants, of whom 5264 were analysed.Most of the studies were conducted in industrialised countries in Europe or Asia. Bowel preparation was conducted over one to three days before surgery and the follow-up period was 30 days in most of the studies. No industrial funding was reported by any of the studies, but only five of the 21 studies provided information on their funding.Overall, slightly more men (58%) than women (42%) were included. The average age of the study participants varied between 42 and 69 years.
We found moderate-certainty evidence that combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and leakages without affecting mortality, the occurrence of postoperative ileus or length of hospital stay.
When comparing combined bowel preparation with oral antibiotics alone or with no bowel preparation, we found low-certainty evidence that there is little to no difference between the compared approaches. There are different reasons why our confidence in the evidence is limited.We are moderately confident in the evidence regarding the reduction of surgical site infections through combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation, because different surgical strategies (in terms of surgical access and type and location of bowel resection) and also different methods of bowel preparation (in terms of agent, dose and timing) were used. We are also only moderately confident in the reduction of anastomotic leakage through combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation, because just a few cases occurred across the included studies.Regarding the comparison of combination therapy with oral antibiotics alone, we have little confidence in the evidence because not enough studies examined this issue to be certain about the results of our outcomes. In addition, there are some concerns about the methods used in the included studies.As there is only one study, we also have little confidence in the evidence comparing combined bowel preparation with no bowel preparation. This evidence is up-to-date as of December 2021.
The evidence is current to May 2017. We found two studies evaluating the progression from MCI to ADD. The studies included 252 MCI eligible participants, with 243 participants that had follow-up. Of these, 127 were women. The average age in one study with two years of follow-up was 72.7 + 7.09 years. In the other study with three years of follow-up, the average age was 71.1 + 8.62 years. The setting in one study was memory clinics.
Study funding sources: both studies were funded by the test manufacturer. The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only two studies, with not enough details on how the people were selected, how the interpretation of the PET scan was made in one study, how the clinical diagnosis of dementia was established in the other study. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. In this review, we found that the 18F-flutemetamol PET scan, as a single test, in one study with 19 participants included with 2 years of follow-up, had a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 80%. This means that in a cohort with 100 participants with MCI and a proportion of progression in this study of 47%, we would expect 42 of 47 MCI participants with a positive result for 18F-flutemetamol scan to progress to ADD, and 5 participants to be falsely positive. In addition, we would expect 42 of 53 participants who will not progress to ADD to have a negative result for 18F-flutemetamol, and 11 to be falsely negative.
In the other study with 224 participants included in the analysis with 3 years follow-up, the sensitivity was 64% and the specificity was 69%. This means that in a cohort with 100 participants with MCI and a proportion of progression in this study of 36%, we would expect 23 of 36 MCI participants with a positive result for 18F-flutemetamol to progress to ADD, and 13 participants to be falsely positive. In addition, we would expect 44 of 64 participants who will not progress to ADD to have a negative result for 18F-flutemetamol, and 20 to be falsely negative.
There was no information regarding the progression from MCI to other forms of dementia and progression to any form of dementia at follow-up.
We conclude that 18F-flutemetamol PET imaging cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD based on the currently available data. More studies are needed to clearly demonstrate its usefulness.
No completed studies have compared different lengths of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, but there is one study under way looking at this question. When the results are published, we plan to include the study in this review. Further research is needed to find the best duration of treatment for exacerbations. A shorter duration of treatment may be better as these courses of treatment are easier for people to complete. They are also less expensive and cause fewer drug reactions than longer treatments. However, it is not clear if shorter treatment is enough to treat infections adequately. It is also not clear whether shorter treatment results in early recurrence or increased frequency of chest infections.
In this review, only one small trial was identified. Currently, there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of antibodies against rotavirus to babies exposed to rotavirus infection. More research is needed.
This review examined whether providing iron supplementation is beneficial for preterm and low birth weight infants. The potential benefits included improvements in the level of red blood cells and stored iron in their blood. In the longer term, it was thought that iron supplementation might improve the babies' growth and development. We identified 25 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which were relevant to this topic. We concluded that the long term benefits of iron supplementation for preterm and low birth weight babies remain uncertain. Regarding red blood cell and iron levels, it was found that in the first year of life, after two months of age, iron supplementation may result in slightly higher iron stores and red blood cell levels, and lower rates of iron deficiency anaemia. However, there was a lot of variability between different studies. More RCTs are needed, using well defined patient groups.
Their effectiveness for treatment or prevention of women’s anxiety during pregnancy needs to be confirmed in clinical trials, as anxiety during the different stages of pregnancy can affect women’s health and have consequences for the child. This review identified few studies that examined this. We included eight randomized controlled studies with 556 women in this review. Based on these studies, there is some not strong evidence for the effectiveness of mind-body interventions in the management of anxiety during pregnancy, labor, or in the first four weeks after giving birth. Compared with usual care, imagery may have a positive effect on anxiety during labor. Another study showed that imagery had a positive effect on anxiety and depression in the immediate postpartum period. Autogenic training might be effective for decreasing women's anxiety before delivering. No harmful effects were reported for any mind-body interventions in the studies included in the review. The studies used different mind-body interventions, sometimes as part of a complex intervention, that they compared with usual care or other potentially active interventions using diverse outcome measures. Several studies were at high risk of bias, had small sample sizes and high dropout rates.
We included randomised controlled trials which compared skin care products, procedures, methods for using skin care products and frequencies of using a skin care product. The participants had to be over 18 years of age. We found thirteen, mostly small, trials, involving 1316 participants. All participants were incontinent for urine, stool, or both and lived in nursing homes or were hospitalised. The trials tested skin care products, procedures, and frequencies of using a skin care product.
Two trials showed that soap and water performed poorly in the prevention and treatment of IAD. A skin cleanser or a washcloth with cleansing, moisturising and protecting properties may be more effective than soap and water. The findings from the other trials suggest that using a skin care product is more effective than withholding a skin care product. We found no evidence that one skin care product performed better than another. The trials did not report on adverse effects. The quality of the evidence was low. Eleven trials had small numbers of participants and were of short duration. The overall risk of bias was high. The trials included in this review tested skin care products, procedures and frequencies of using a skin care product. Very limited evidence exists on the effects of interventions for preventing and treating IAD in adults. Larger, long-term and well performed trials are required. Furthermore, we recommend the development of a list of outcomes which are important for patients and will guide researchers in their study. This list should include well developed tools to measure the items in order to obtain accurate results. The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 28 September 2016.
The main purpose of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia and wide spread musculoskeletal pain among working age adults. Patients included in the controlled trials in this review ranged in age from 18-65 years. Seven studies, with 1050 patients were included. The effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation was graded limited, showing no quantifiable benefit for both fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain.
We searched for all randomised controlled trials to March 2016 that compared at least one of the newer techniques with surgery, when treating short saphenous vein (SSVs; found in the lower leg) varices. We found three trials comparing EVLA with surgery; one trial compared UGFS with surgery, but none reported RFA. The main measures (outcomes) were recanalisation (blood flowing in the veins again) or persistence of reflux (due to failure of treatment) at six weeks; recurrence of reflux at one year; clinical evidence of recurrence (presence of new varicose veins) at one year; repeat treatment due to failure; quality of life (QoL) at six weeks and one year after the treatment; and complications after treatment.
The EVLA versus surgery comparison included 311 participants: 185 received EVLA and 126 received surgery. In the UGFS comparison, each treatment group contained 21 people. For several outcomes in the EVLA comparison, only one study provided data; consequently, this review has limited ability to demonstrate meaningful results for some planned outcomes.
EVLA versus surgery: there was less recanalisation or persistence of reflux at six weeks and less recurrence of reflux at one year in the EVLA group; however, there were insufficient data to report clear differences in clinical recurrence at one year. One trial reported four participants in each group required further treatment. There was no difference between treatments in QoL. Although some participants had postoperative complications (e.g., sural nerve injury (the sural nerve is in the calf), infection, deep venous thrombosis (DVT; blood clots in veins), inflammation of the wall of the vein), most complications improved without treatment and the two cases of DVT resolved after treatment with medicines.
UGFS versus surgery: there were insufficient data to detect clear differences between treatment groups for recanalisation or persistence of reflux at six weeks and recurrence of reflux at one year. Data were not available for other outcomes. For the EVLA comparison, the quality of evidence was moderate for recanalisation or persistence of reflux, QoL and complications, all at six weeks, and retreatment due to technical failure, but low for recurrence of reflux, QoL and clinical evidence of recurrence after one year. The quality of evidence was downgraded due to imprecision (small number of trials with few participants) and bias (outcome assessors aware of treatment allocation in some studies and one study recruited insufficient participants with SSV). For the UGFS comparison, evidence was low quality because one study (with few participants with SSV) offered UGFS and several participants were missing from the analysis.
The main difficulty with this review was lack of data: we found a small number of trials and two trials had substantial amounts of unavailable data. Further well-designed studies are needed.
We wanted to find out if methylphenidate improves children's ADHD symptoms (attention, hyperactivity) based mainly on teachers' ratings using various scales, and whether it causes serious unwanted effects, like death, hospitalisation, or disability. We were also interested in less serious unwanted effects like sleep problems and loss of appetite, and its effects on children's general behaviour and quality of life. We searched for studies that investigated the use of methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD. Participants in the studies had to be aged 18 years or younger and have a diagnosis of ADHD. They could have other disorders or illnesses and be taking other medication or undergoing behavioural treatments. They had to have a normal IQ (intelligence quotient). Studies could compare methylphenidate with placebo (something designed to look and taste the same as methylphenidate but with no active ingredient) or no treatment. Participants had to be randomly chosen to receive methylphenidate or not. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 212 studies with 16,302 children or adolescents with ADHD. Most of the trials compared methylphenidate with placebo. Most studies were small with around 70 children, with an average age of 10 years (ages ranged from 3 to 18 years). Most studies were short, lasting an average of around a month; the shortest study lasted just one day and the longest 425 days. Most studies were in the USA.
Based on teachers' ratings, compared with placebo or no treatment, methylphenidate:
- may improve ADHD symptoms (21 studies, 1728 children)
- may make no difference to serious unwanted effects (26 studies, 3673 participants)
- may cause more non-serious unwanted effects (35 studies, 5342 participants)
- may improve general behaviour (7 trials 792 participants)
- may not affect quality of life (4 trials, 608 participants) Our confidence in the results of the review is limited for several reasons. It was often possible for people in the studies to know which treatment the children were taking, which could influence the results. The reporting of the results was not complete in many studies and for some outcomes the results varied across studies. Studies were small and they used different scales for measuring symptoms. And most of the studies only lasted for a short period of time, making it impossible to assess the long-term effects of methylphenidate. Around 41% of studies were funded or partly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. This is an update of a review conducted in 2015. The evidence is current to March 2022.
We found 27 studies involving over 5410 people with kidney disease that looked at the benefits and complications of different anaemia treatments, comparing the newer anaemia treatment (CERA) with the older treatments (darbepoetin and epoetin alfa or beta). We found that it was uncertain whether anaemia drugs had different effects on heart disease complications, life expectancy, or anaemia in the people receiving treatment to increase their blood count. There was no information about whether CERA led to better quality of life for people receiving this drug. Based on the information in this Cochrane review, clinical decisions about the choice of different anaemia drugs can be based on drug cost and availability.
This review of two trials with 149 patients found no conclusive evidence to support surgical treatment for people with degeneration, radiculopathy or myelopathy. Possible limitations of this review include the the lack of large trials and the risk of bias associated with these studies. Further research is very likely to change the estimate of effects and our confidence in the results.
Future large-scale randomised trials with better methods are needed to provide clear evidence on the balance between risk and benefit from surgery for individuals with cervical degeneration with radiculopathy or myelopathy.
We wanted to find out if therapeutic exercises are effective in reducing spinal curves and postponing or avoiding invasive treatments such as bracing or surgery. We searched medical databases for studies where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups comparing therapeutic exercises with no treatment, other non-surgical treatments such as braces, or other exercises. We extracted and summarised data and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and how accurate the results were. We included 13 studies involving 583 participants. Most participants had scoliosis of low or medium severity. Five studies were conducted in China and one each in Brazil, Canada, Italy, Korea, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the USA, and Egypt. The therapeutic exercises assessed in the studies were different in type and duration (between 12 and 42 months).
We are very uncertain whether therapeutic exercises are less effective than using braces in reducing curve progression in adolescents with scoliosis of medium severity, or improve quality of life slightly.
We do not know if different types of therapeutic exercises make any difference in scoliosis progression, quality of life, and cosmetic issues.
None of the included studies assessed the unwanted effects. Participants included in the studies knew which interventions they received; therefore, they could have been influenced by how much trust they had in the intervention when reporting improvements based on their personal experience, and performing the exercises by increasing their motivation.
All studies included only a few participants. Therefore, we have little confidence in their results, as they could be different when the interventions are delivered in clinical practice. This review updates our previous review from 2012. The evidence is up to date to 17 November 2022.
This systematic review of 39 studies (2564 participants) found that tricyclic antidepressants between 75-100 mg/day and possibly below this range result in more reduction in depression than placebo. On the other hand, there was no strong evidence to show that standard dosage tricyclic brings about more response than low dosage tricyclic. The findings suggest that administration of low dosage tricyclic antidepressant is a defensible practice.
Syphilis is a potentially fatal, sexually transmitted disease that passes from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby. If the woman is untreated, the fetus might be aborted or her baby may be born with the disease, suffer permanent disability and be disfigured. The effectiveness of penicillin in curing infection with syphilis in pregnant women and preventing the baby being born with congenital syphilis was established soon after its introduction in the 1940s and before the widespread use of randomised controlled trials. Although rare in developed countries, the incidence of syphilis is high and increasing in many developing countries, particularly where HIV/AIDS is common. The review of trials found no trials comparing the effectiveness of different doses of penicillin or comparing penicillin with other antibiotics. More research is needed to find the best dosage and duration of treatment.
This review found two eligible studies. The first study evaluated a game based on the TV show Family Feud and taught about infection control. The second study evaluated the use of a "Snakes and Ladders" board game in continuing medical education on stroke prevention and management. The two studies did not consistently show a beneficial effect on knowledge. We are therefore very uncertain whether games improve health care professional practice or patient care.
This review aimed to assess the impact of infant massage on mental and physical outcomes for healthy mother-infant dyads in the first six months of life. A total of 34 randomised trials were included. Twenty of these had significant problems with their design and the way they were carried out. This means that the we are not as confident as we would otherwise be that the findings are valid. That is to say, the findings of these 20 included studies may over- or under-estimate the true effect of massage therapy.
We combined the data for 14 outcomes measured physical health and 18 outcomes measured aspects of mental health or development. The results show limited statistically significant benefits for a number of aspects of physical health (for example, weight, length, head/arm/leg circumference, 24-hour sleep duration; time spent crying or fussing; blood bilirubin and number of episodes of illness) and mental health/development (for example, fine/gross motor skills personal and social behaviour and psychomotor development). However, all significant results were lost either at later follow-up points or when we removed the large number of studies regarded to be at high risk of bias.
These findings do not currently support the use of infant massage with low-risk population groups of parents and infants. The results obtained from this review may be due to the poor quality of many of the included studies, the failure to address the mechanisms by which infant massage could have an impact on the outcomes being assessed, and the inclusion of inappropriate outcomes for population groups (such as weight gain). Future research should focus on the benefits of infant massage for higher-risk population groups (for example, socially deprived parent-infant dyads), the duration of massage programmes, and could address differences between babies being massaged by parents or healthcare professionals.
This is an update of the original review first published in 2013. We searched scientific databases in February 2016 and found 11 randomised clinical trials including 2246 adults with atrial fibrillation who were taking oral anticoagulant medication. The trials we found compared education, decision aids, and self-monitoring plus education to usual care, over any length of time. Few studies had comparable groups and data. There was uncertainty about the effect of self-monitoring plus education on the percentage of time the INR was within the therapeutic range because the proportion or time in the therapeutic range was similar between individuals who received self-monitoring plus education and those who did not. There were small and positive effects on anxiety and depression in individuals who received education compared to those who received usual care. There were small and negative effects on decision conflict in individuals who received decision aids compared to those who received usual care. The evidence should be interpreted with caution as the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to low across different outcomes because of the limitations of individual studies. It is likely that further high-quality trials may affect these reported results.
For the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, the evidence supports the use of the double test of two blood markers; pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhCG), in combination with the mother's age. This test detects around seven out of every 10 (68%) pregnancies affected by Down's. It is common practice to offer amniocentesis or CVS to women with a high risk test result. About one in 20 women (5%) having this test will have a ‘high risk’ result but most of these women will not be carrying a baby with Down’s. We found for tests in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, there is little evidence to support the use of serum tests made up of more than two blood markers.Other important information to considerThe blood tests themselves have no adverse effects for the woman, over and above the risks of a routine blood test. However some women who have a ‘high risk’ screening test result, and are given amniocentesis or CVS have a risk of miscarrying a baby unaffected by Down’s. Parents will need to weigh up this risk when deciding whether or not to have an amniocentesis or CVS following a ‘high risk’ screening test result.
This review compared the benefits and harms of laparoscopic-endoscopic rendezvous versus preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy (cutting the muscle between the bile and pancreatic ducts) procedures followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy to remove stones from the gallbladder and bile duct. By searching scientific databases and trials registers, we found five randomised clinical trials that compared the two approaches, and involved a total of 516 participants. The majority of the participants were females and the age of both men and women ranged from 21 years to 87 years. Only one trial stated they had not received industry sponsorship or other for-profit support. None of the other trials disclosed information about funding. Three trials stated the investigators had no competing interest; the other two trials did not provide information on competing interests. The laparoscopic-endoscopic rendezvous approach could be associated with a lower rate of overall morbidity and clinical post-operative pancreatitis, and a shorter hospital stay. We found no clear differences in overall mortality between the two techniques. Total operative time was longer with the rendezvous approach.
We were unable to draw firm conclusions because of the lack of data. Further research is needed to confirm whether the single-stage approach is safer and more efficacious than the two-stage approach, and to address other important issues, such as quality of life and cost analysis. The quality of the evidence was low or very low, because of small numbers of participants, high risk of bias, and inconsistent and imprecise results across trials. The evidence is current to February 2017.
From a wide search, we identified three RCTs that met our selection criteria. The trials involved a total of 530 adults with peripheral neuropathy. Treatments were ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in people with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in two trials, and amantadine in Guillain-Barré syndrome in the third. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an inherited nerve disease and Guillain-Barré syndrome is a condition where there is inflammation of the peripheral nerves. We chose measures of fatigue at four to 12 weeks as our preferred measure of the effects of treatment. The amantadine trial but not the ascorbic acid trials provided data at this time point; the ascorbic acid trials provided data more than 12 months after the start of the intervention. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of amantadine when compared with an inactive treatment (placebo) for fatigue. and there were no major unwanted effects. We found evidence that ascorbic acid probably has little meaningful benefit for fatigue. No major unwanted effects were identified, but the trials were small. We assessed the quality of this evidence as moderate because the results were imprecise, which means they do not rule out the possibility that the drugs could have an effect. We found no evidence from RCTs on other medicines or treatments for fatigue in peripheral neuropathy.
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of amantadine for fatigue in GBS and ascorbic acid for fatigue in CMT1A. More high-quality studies are needed to provide evidence on which to base management of feelings of fatigue in peripheral neuropathy. The cost effectiveness of different interventions should also be considered in future RCTs.
The evidence in this review is current to November 2013.
The review of trials found that using corticosteroids for lung sarcoidosis leads to some short-term benefit in terms of chest x-ray, but there is limited evidence that this benefit lasts or affects the long term outcomes of the disease.
A wide variety of surfactant products have been formulated and studied in clinical trials. These include synthetic surfactants and animal derived surfactant extracts. Animal derived surfactant extracts are obtained from animal or human sources. Trials of surfactant replacement have either tried to prevent the development of respiratory distress in high-risk premature infants or treat established respiratory distress in premature infants. Infants with established respiratory distress syndrome who receive animal derived surfactant extract treatment have a decreased risk of lung rupture (pneumothorax), a decreased risk of lung injury (pulmonary interstitial emphysema), a decreased risk of dying, and a decreased risk of chronic lung injury (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) or death.
Three randomised controlled studies were identified. Overall the quality of the evidence from these studies was moderate. They were reported on between 1977 and 1991 and involved a total of 309 participants. Each reported on different comparisons. Below knee amputation using skew flaps or sagittal flaps provided no advantage over the long posterior flap technique on primary stump healing, which approached 60% for all groups. In the third study, involving 30 participants with wet gangrene, a two-stage procedure with a guillotine amputation at the ankle followed by long posterior flap amputation led to better primary stump healing than a one-stage procedure with delayed skin closure. Post-operative infection rate or wound necrosis, reamputation and mobility with a prosthetic limb were similar in the different comparisons.
Nearly all the surgeons in the study that looked at skew flap amputation versus the long posterior flap technique were new to the skew flap operation and so were on a learning curve. Factors which might have influenced the findings include previous experience of a technique, the extent of non-viable tissue, and location of pre-existing surgical scars.
We found a total of three studies involving 136 participants with an average age between 33 and 36 years with well-controlled asthma. They underwent water-based exercise from 40 to 60 minutes three to five times a week; the programme lasted 10 to 24 weeks in two studies, and one day only in one study.
We considered data reported on quality of life, asthma general symptoms or asthma exacerbations, measure of lung function (FEV1, forced expiratory volume of the lung in the first second of air expired) and adverse events. The quality of evidence is very low because of issues with selection of participants, small number of participants, differences in exercise duration and intensity and differences in levels of asthma. Often surrogate endpoints were measured instead of patient-important outcomes.
To sum up, more studies are needed to find out the effect and safety of water-based exercise for adults with asthma. The quality of evidence is very low because of issues with selection of participants, differences in exercise duration and intensity and differences in levels of asthma; surrogate endpoints were measured instead of patient-important outcomes.
This plain language summary is current as of 13 May 2014.
We could only identify studies on aclidinium and formoterol combination and included seven studies involving 5921 people with COPD which ranged from four weeks to one year long. Most participants were men in their 60s, moderate-to-heavy smokers, around half of whom were current smokers. They had moderate-to-severe symptoms of COPD when they started treatment. People in the studies took either combined inhalers containing aclidinium and formoterol or aclidinium or formoterol or placebo through a similar inhaler. Both people doing the research and people in the study did not know which treatment participants were getting. The conclusions of this review are current to October 2018. People taking combined inhaler and aclidinium inhaler were not different in terms of flare-ups that need additional medicines, quality of life, hospitalisations, side effects or serious side effects. However, they were less breathless than those taking aclidinium inhaler. Fourteen people with COPD would need to be treated with combined inhalers to have one additional person with a clinically significant improvement in breathlessness.
People on combined inhalers were likely to have fewer flare-ups, side effects and symptoms and a better quality of life compared to those taking formoterol inhaler. But, there was little or no difference in hospital admissions due to severe flare-ups, serious side effects or the risk of dying.
When compared to dummy inhalers, people taking combined inhalers experienced less breathlessness and better quality of life. Seven people with COPD would need to be treated with combined inhaler to achieve a significant improvement in quality of life than dummy inhaler. For flare-ups, hospital admissions, side effects, serious side effects and death, there was no difference between combined and dummy inhalers.
The lungs worked better in people taking combined inhalers than those taking only one drug or dummy inhaler. We had to interpret the results carefully as all the included studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, which could have led to bias. However, the included studies were generally conducted in a systematic and acceptable manner. We are confident that combined inhalers are more effective than single or dummy inhalers at improving breathlessness and lung function. However, we are less certain about its effects on flare-ups, hospital admissions, quality of life and side effects. Combined inhalers are more effective than individual or dummy inhalers for relieving breathlessness and improving lung performance. They also lead to better quality of life than formoterol or dummy inhalers. However, they are not different from individual or dummy inhalers in terms of flare-ups or hospital admissions. These combined inhalers have similar safety profiles as individual or dummy inhalers in terms of death, side effects or serious side effects. Combined inhalers probably had lesser side effects and moderate flare-ups than formoterol, but further studies are needed to confidently support this finding. In summary, the combined inhalers are an effective option for treatment of COPD and appear to have a similar safety profile to individual or dummy inhalers.
We found 44 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing metformin versus the OCP (alone or in combination) in a total of 2253 women with PCOS which comprised 39 RCTs on adult women (2047 women) and five RCTs on adolescent women (206 women). We combined results from the studies and assessed the quality of the studies to judge how confident we could be in their results. The evidence is current to August 2019. In adult women, when we compared metformin to the OCP in terms of improving excessive facial and body hair, metformin may be less effective in women with PCOS with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 kg/m2 to 30 kg/m2, but we are uncertain of the effect with BMI less than 25 kg/m2 or greater than 30 kg/m2. In terms of severe adverse events (requiring stopping of medication), metformin may result in a higher incidence of gastro-intestinal (i.e. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), but a lower incidence of other adverse events. Evidence suggests that if the severe gastro-intestinal adverse event rate following the OCP is 0.3%, then the severe gastro-intestinal adverse event rate after metformin would be between 1% and 4.5%. Evidence also suggests that if the severe other adverse event rate following the OCP is 12%, the severe other adverse event rate after metformin would between 1% and 6%.
Either metformin alone or the OCP alone may be less effective in improving excessive facial and body hair compared to the combination of the OCP with metformin. In terms of severe adverse events, we are uncertain if there was a difference between metformin and metformin combined with the OCP for gastro-intestinal or other adverse events. If the severe gastro-intestinal adverse event rate following metformin combined with the OCP is 7%, then the corresponding rate after metformin would be between 2% and 17%, and if the severe other adverse event rate following metformin combined with the OCP is 6%, the corresponding rate after metformin would be between 0.7% and 15%.
When comparing the OCP to metformin combined with the OCP in terms of severe adverse events, there may be a lower incidence of gastro-intestinal adverse events with the OCP, but we are uncertain if there is a difference in other adverse events. If the severe gastro-intestinal adverse event rate is 10% following metformin combined with the OCP, the corresponding rate following the OCP would be between 1% and 7%. If the severe other adverse event rate is 4% following Metformin combined with the OCP, the corresponding rate following the OCP would be between 2% and 18%.
In adolescent women, we are uncertain as to whether there is a difference between any of the three comparisons in this review in terms of hirsutism and adverse events (both severe requiring stopping medication and minor) due to either a lack of evidence or very low-quality evidence based on one trial. The evidence was of very low to low quality. The main limitations in the evidence were poor reporting of study methods and a lack of both precision and consistency in the results.
Twenty three trials with 3685 participants were included in the review. Participants were more likely to improve if they were using an anticholinergic drug compared with bladder training alone, and also when using a combination of an anticholinergic drug plus bladder training. More people reported an improvement in their overactive bladder symptoms when using electrical stimulation than an anticholinergic drug, but this was only significant in one trial for one type of electrical stimulation, percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation. These results have to be viewed with caution as different types and doses of the anticholinergic drugs were used in the trials. The main adverse effect reported was dry mouth, in about a third of the people taking an anticholinergic drug.
This review is up-to-date as of September 2016. We included five trials involving 4197 people; all trials assessed glyceryl trinitrate, a drug that is given as a skin patch and which releases nitric oxide. One study was international, whilst the remainder were studies performed at single centres. Not all trials contributed data to all outcomes. We used both unpublished and published information, where available. We did not find any trials assessing other nitrate drugs, L-arginine, or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. Overall, glyceryl trinitrate did not improve the rate of death or dependency compared with those who did not receive glyceryl trinitrate after acute stroke. Glyceryl trinitrate did not improve other outcomes including death and quality of life. Glyceryl trinitrate lowers blood pressure, and increases heart rate and headache in people with acute stroke. The key results are based on high-quality evidence. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of drugs affecting nitric oxide production in acute stroke. Overall, glyceryl trinitrate is inexpensive, lowers blood pressure, increases heart rate and headache, but does not change clinical outcomes in people who have suffered a stroke.
We included adult patients aged 18 years and above undergoing elective surgery in the operating room setting. We found that the effects of drugs on the stress response was the subject of 72 studies. The investigators used 32 drugs. Promising results were seen in the reduction of arrhythmias with intravenous injections of beta blockers (drugs that decrease the heart rate), narcotics (drug used to treat pain), local anaesthetics, and calcium channel blockers (drugs that block movement of calcium). Serious side effects were only reported with high doses of narcotics and an increase in airway pressure was seen in some patients with beta blockers. Only local anaesthetic drugs clearly reduced the risk of myocardial ischaemia but this evidence came from only one trial.
There was some difficulty in comparing and interpreting the results of these different trials. Patients at a high risk of complications were investigated in 17 trials. A reduction in arrhythmias with treatment was seen in this high risk group but the number of studies was too small to reach a conclusion. Doctors need to further research the effects of drugs used for blunting the haemodynamic response and their effect on outcomes in terms of morbidity, in a standardized manner.
Study characteristics
We included 16 studies (900 participants) in this review. All participants were otherwise healthy children (aged under 15 years) who were scheduled for day surgery. The studies compared different types of intravenous and inhaled anaesthetic medications. The authors found that when compared to inhaled anaesthesia with sevoflurane, intravenous anaesthesia with propofol may reduce the risk of PONV and the risk of behavioural problems with no difference in the time to recovery from anaesthesia and discharge from hospital in children having day surgery. The effect on complications was imprecise. The studies that compared other anaesthetic agents involved different types of surgical procedures, different procedure durations and drugs, making it difficult to sum the results. Most of the trials included in this review were of poor quality and had high risk of bias. There was great variety in the included studies in the combinations of drugs, duration of anaesthesia and types of surgical procedures, which made the results uncertain. Further trials are needed to compare the types of anaesthesia used in children's ambulatory surgery.
Participants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found 12 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 5238 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from two years to six years. Most trials included people defined as being at increased risk of type 2 diabetes based on glucose levels measured two hours after ingestion of 75 g of glucose (i.e. 'impaired glucose tolerance' (IGT) after an oral glucose tolerance test).
This evidence is up to date as of January 2017. We used a MEDLINE email alert service to identify newly published studies up to September 2017. One study compared diet only with physical activity only. Fifty-seven of 130 participants (44%) in the diet-only group compared with 58 of 141 participants (41%) in the physical activity-only group developed type 2 diabetes. Two studies compared physical activity with standard treatment; in one study 58 of 141 participants (41%) in the physical activity group compared with 90 of 133 participants (68%) in the control group developed type 2 diabetes; in the other study 10 of 84 participants (12%) in the physical activity group compared with seven out of 39 participants (18%) in the control group developed type 2 diabetes. Eleven studies compared diet plus physical activity with standard or no treatment. Diet plus physical activity decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which occurred in 315 of 2122 participants (15%) in the diet plus physical activity group compared with 614 of 2389 participants (26%) in the standard treatment group.
We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of diet, physical activity or both with regard to heart attacks or strokes. Our included studies did not report on complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health-related quality of life were inconclusive. Very few participants died in the course of the studies and side-effects were also rare. Future long-term studies should investigate more patient-important outcomes like complications of diabetes, because we do not know for sure whether ’prediabetes’ is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement or is, in fact, a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient-important outcomes. All included trials had deficiencies in the way that they were conducted or how key items were reported. For diet plus physical activity compared with standard treatment, we found rather good evidence that the development of new type 2 diabetes was reduced or delayed. For the other comparisons the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).
We included 18 randomized controlled trials with 3815 women. The trials were conducted in Belgium, France, Israel, Italy, Iran, Singapore, the Netherlands and the UK. The evidence is current to 2 December 2016. This review did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of one cycle regimen in preference to another in preparation for FET in subfertile women with regular ovulatory cycles. The most common modalities for FET are natural cycle with or without HCG trigger or endometrial preparation with HT, with or without GnRHa suppression. We identified only four direct comparisons of these two modalities and there was insufficient evidence to support the use of either one in preference to the other. We found no evidence specific to non-ovulatory women. The evidence was of low or very low quality. The main limitations were failure to report important clinical outcomes, poor reporting of study methods and unclear findings due to lack of data.
Daratumumab is a newly developed medicine that causes the death of myeloma cells. The addition of daratumumab has been approved for people who have already tried other treatments for multiple myeloma but whose disease returned or never got any better. We wanted to find out if daratumumab added to antimyeloma medicines shows advantages or disadvantages in adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who aren't suited for a stem cell transplant when compared to antimyeloma medicines alone. We searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of daratumumab plus antimyeloma medicines with the same antimyeloma medicines alone in adults with a newly confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma who were not suitable for high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation. We compared and summarised the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found four studies involving a total of 1783 adults (females and males) with confirmed newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were unsuitable for stem cell transplantation. The average age of participants in three studies was 69 to 74 years.
Treatment with daratumumab probably increases how long people live. At 36 months after treatment, 695 of 1000 people who received antimyeloma treatment alone and 792 of 1000 people who received the same treatment plus daratumumab were still alive.
Treatment with daratumumab probably increases the length of time that multiple myeloma does not get any worse. At 24 months after treatment, 494 of 1000 people who received antimyeloma treatment alone and 713 of 1000 people who received the same treatment plus daratumumab had disease that did not get worse.
Treatment with daratumumab may slightly improve quality of life at 12 months, but we have little confidence in this result. The daratumumab group was 2.19 higher on a 0-to-100 scoring system than the antimyeloma treatment-alone group.
Treatment with daratumumab probably increases the chance of serious adverse events (treatment-related health problems that result in hospitalisation or that are life-threatening). After the longest follow-up available (12 to 72 months), 505 of 1000 people in the antimyeloma treatment-alone group and 596 of 1000 people in the daratumumab group experienced serious adverse events.
There is likely little or no difference between groups in overall adverse events (CTCAE grade ≥ 3). After the longest follow-up available (12 to 72 months), 953 of 1000 people in the antimyeloma treatment-alone group and 963 of 1000 people in the daratumumab group experienced adverse effects (CTCAE grade ≥ 3).
Treatment with daratumumab probably increases the risk of infections (CTCAE grade ≥ 3). After the longest follow-up available (12 to 72 months), 224 of 1000 people in the antimyeloma treatment-alone group and 340 of 1000 people in the daratumumab group had infections (CTCAE grade ≥ 3). We are moderately confident in the evidence about how long people live because of incomplete data in one trial.
We are moderately confident in the evidence about the length of time after treatment that multiple myeloma doesn't get worse, serious adverse events, adverse events (CTCAE grade ≥ 3), and infections (CTCAE grade ≥ 3). This was due to the possibility that participants and personnel in the studies were aware of the treatment given, which could have influenced the results, and because the findings for serious adverse events were very different across the included studies.
We have little confidence in the evidence about quality of life due to the possibility that participants and personnel in the studies were aware of the treatment given, which could have influenced the results, and because of the small study sizes. The evidence is current to September 2023. Several new studies of daratumumab are ongoing that may provide more information about the possible benefits and harms of daratumumab for multiple myeloma. We will update this review when those studies are finished.
We wanted to find out if MRI is accurate enough to diagnose liver cancer in adults with chronic liver disease. We were interested first, in liver cancers of any size and stage and second, in liver cancers that were suitable for resection. We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of MRI scans compared to the best available tests to confirm liver cancer in adults with chronic liver disease. The best available tests are examination of the liver, or part of the liver under a microscope. We found 34 studies assessing 4841 people.
Around 560 of 1000 (56%) adults with chronic liver disease have confirmed liver cancer. Of these 1000 people, MRI may:
- correctly detect liver cancer in 473 people;
- miss liver cancer in 87 people;
- incorrectly detect liver cancer in 27 cancer-free people;
- correctly detect no liver cancer in 413 people.
Based on the studies, around 560 of 1000 (56%) adults with chronic liver disease have confirmed resectable liver cancer. Of these 1000 people, MRI may:
- correctly detect resectable liver cancer in 472 people;
- miss resectable liver cancer in 88 people;
- incorrectly detect resectable liver cancer in 31 people;
- correctly detect no resectable liver cancer in 409 people. Our confidence in the evidence is limited because the studies used different methods to select study participants and used different definitions for the presence of liver disease. This means MRI scans could be more or less accurate than suggested by our analyses of the evidence. The evidence is up to date to 9 November 2021.
We included 14 studies with a total of 978 randomised children with stones in either the kidney or ureter, which connects the kidney to the bladder. The number of children in the studies varied from 22 to 221 children. There were seven trials of different types of surgery, four trials of medications and one study that compared medication with surgery. The amount of time the trials followed participants for ranged from one week to one year. Shock waves versus medication to dissolve stones: we are uncertain about the effect on successful removal of stones, serious complications and the need for a second procedure to treat the stones.
Shock waves given slowly versus shock waves given fast: we are uncertain about the effect of slow shock waves on successful removal of stones. We are also uncertain about the effect on serious complications and the need for other procedures.
Shock waves versus treatment using a scope through the bladder to break up the stone: we are uncertain about the effect of shock waves on successful removal of stones compared to using a scope. We are also uncertain about the effect on serious complications and the need for other procedures.
Shock waves versus treatment using a scope through the skin into the kidney: shock waves are likely less successful in the removal of stones. Shock waves appears to reduce severe adverse events but more often secondary procedures are needed to remove all the stones.
Use of a scope through the kidney with a drainage tube afterwards versus without a drainage tube: we are uncertain about the effect on successful removal of stones, serious complications or the need for more procedures.
Use of a scope through the kidney with a regular versus very small ("mini") tube through the skin: successful removal of stones are likely similar in both procedures. We did not find any data relating to serious adverse events. We are uncertain about the effect on the need for another procedure.
Alpha-blockers versus placebo with or without ibuprofen: alpha-blockers may increase successful removal of stones. We are uncertain about serious complications and the need for more procedures. The quality of evidence for most outcomes was very low. This means that we are very uncertain about most of the review findings.
We examined the available evidence up to 13 April 2016 and included six trials with 590 people, which evaluated prednisolone given with antituberculous treatment (ATT). One included trial was of high quality, while the rest had uncertainties regarding trial quality. All the included trials were in adults; one trial included only HIV-positive people, two included only HIV-negative people, and three did not report the HIV status of the participants.
Corticosteroids may reduce the time to resolution of the symptoms of TB pleurisy and the time to resolution of the pleural effusion on chest X-ray (low certainty evidence). Corticosteroids may also reduce the risk of having signs of pleural scarring on chest X-ray (pleural thickening and pleural adhesions) after the disease has resolved (low certainty evidence ). There was not enough information about lung function to be sure whether or not corticosteroids reduce the risk of lung function impairment after TB pleurisy (very low certainty evidence).
Corticosteroids may increase the risk of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial drug (low certainty evidence ). From one trial in people living with HIV, there was no detectable increase in HIV-related conditions with corticosteroids, although cases of Kaposi's sarcoma were only seen in the corticosteroid group and numbers of participants and events were too small to rule out an effect of corticosteroids (very low certainty evidence).
As the risk of disability and long-term illness after TB pleurisy is unclear, research looking at the association between TB pleurisy and lung function impairment would be useful to inform future research into corticosteroids for TB pleurisy.
We found 17 randomised controlled trials with a total of 2505 participants. Most were not commercially funded. None of the trials compared repeated single embryo transfer (SET) with multiple embryo transfer. A majority of the studies had low numbers of participants. Reported results of multiple embryo transfer below refer to double embryo transfer. Repeated single embryo transfer versus multiple embryo transfer in a single cycle
Based on low-quality evidence, there was no indication that overall live birth and clinical pregnancy rates differed substantially when repeated SET (either two cycles of single embryo transfer or one cycle of single embryo transfer followed by transfer of a single frozen embryo) was compared with double embryo transfer (DET). For a woman with a 42% chance of live birth following a single cycle of DET, the chance following repeated single embryo transfer would be between 34% and 46%. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that the risk of multiple birth is much lower in the SET group (between 0% and 3%) compared to a 13% chance of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of DET. The chance of miscarriage rate is similar between the two groups.
Single versus multiple embryo transfer in a single cycle
We found low-quality evidence that the rates of live birth and clinical pregnancy (CPR) were lower after one cycle of fresh SET compared with the outcome of one cycle of fresh DET. For a woman with a 46% chance of live birth following one cycle of DET, the chance following one cycle of SET was between 27% and 35%. However, the risk of multiple pregnancy was higher after DET. There was no difference in the chance of miscarriage between the two groups. While live birth and clinical pregnancy was lower following SET compared to DET after single fresh cycle, there was no difference between overall live birth rate and CPR following consecutive SET versus a single cycle of DET. However, the multiple pregnancy rate is much lower following SET compared to DET. Most of the evidence currently available concerns younger women with a good prognosis. The quality of evidence was low to moderate primarily due to inadequate reporting of study methods and absence of masking those delivering, as well as receiving the interventions.
We wanted to know whether using PNBs compared to no nerve block (no block at all or a placebo nerve block), in people with hip fracture could reduce:
• pain on movement;
• confusion, myocardial infarction, and chest infection;
• death from any cause within six months;
• length of time until people were mobile after surgery; and
• costs of drugs used to manage pain. We searched medical databases for studies that investigated the use of PNBs versus no effective nerve block (i.e. no block at all or a placebo block) for pain in people with hip fracture. Study participants had to be over 16 years of age and had to have a hip fracture. We looked for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where the treatment people receive is decided randomly. We included 49 studies with 3061 participants (average age 59 to 89 years); 1553 participants received PNBs and 1508 received no nerve block. Additional pain relief, including opioids, was available for all participants when required. Studies were conducted in various countries and published between 1980 and 2020. Twenty-six studies received non-commercial funding, and the source of funding was not stated for the other studies. PNBs reduced pain on movement by 2.5 on a scale of 1 to 10, compared with no nerve block (11 studies, 503 participants). PNBs reduced the risk of confusion; for every 12 people with a hip fracture, one person less will become confused with PNBs (13 studies, 1072 participants). We did not find a difference in risk of myocardial infarction (1 study, 31 participants).
PNBs probably reduce the risk of chest infection (3 studies, 131 participants) and time to first mobilization after surgery by 11 hours (3 studies, 208 participants). We did not find a difference in deaths from any cause within six months (11 studies, 617 participants). Costs of drugs used for pain management were slightly lower when a single-injection PNB was compared to no PNB (1 study, 75 participants). Our confidence (certainty) in the evidence for reduced pain on movement and for reduced confusion was high; we are moderately confident in the evidence for reduced chest infection. However, we are less confident about the evidence for myocardial infarction, death, time to first mobilization, and costs of drugs used for pain management, mainly because this evidence came from small studies with few participants. We found enough good-quality evidence to support the use of PNBs in patients with hip fracture. Larger studies are required to clarify the effects of PNBs on myocardial infarction and death. This is an updated review. Evidence is up-to-date to 16 November 2019.
The review authors rated ten of the 18 RCTs as having a low risk of bias in the way the trials were conducted and reported. They were unable to statistically pool the results because the injection sites, drugs used and outcomes measured were too varied. Only five of the 18 trials reported significant results in favour of one of the treatment arms. The reviewer authors considered the likely treatment benefits to be worth the potential harms in only two studies. 
In nine out of the 18 studies, side effects such as headache, dizziness, transient local pain, tingling and numbness and nausea were reported in small numbers of patients. The use of morphine was more frequently associated with itching, nausea and vomiting. Rare but more serious complications of injection therapy have been mentioned in the literature, such as cauda equina syndrome, septic facet joint arthritis, discitis, paraplegia, paraspinal abscesses. Although the absolute frequency of these complications may be rare, these risks should be taken into consideration. 

Based on these results, the review authors concluded that there is no strong evidence for or against the use of any type of injection therapy for individuals with subacute or chronic low-back pain.
Risperidone and olanzapine are among a class of antipsychotic drugs commonly referred to as atypical antipsychotics or new generation drugs. We systematically reviewed the effects of risperidone in comparison to olanzapine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses. We were able to include 16 studies. Both drugs appear to have favourable effects in terms of improvement of symptoms. Both these drugs are also associated with adverse effects. Risperidone is commonly associated with movement disorders and sexual dysfunction and olanzapine with considerable weight gain.
We wanted to find out if calcium supplements or calcium-fortified foods help people with overweight or obesity to lose weight. We also wanted to find out if calcium supplements were associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that investigated the effects of calcium supplements in people with overweight, and obesity. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 18 studies involving 1873 participants. All the studies gave participants calcium tablets of varying doses. We did not find any studies evaluating calcium-fortified foods or drinks. The studies included adults from 18 to 80 years old. Ten of the 18 studies included only women, and across all the studies, most of the participants were female. Eight studies were conducted in the USA, six in Iran, one each in Brazil, China, and Puerto Rico, and one study was carried out in centres in Argentina, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.
- Our findings suggest that calcium supplements may have little to no effect on reducing overall body weight, compared to not taking supplements. 
- Calcium supplements probably lead to a small reduction in body mass index (or BMI, a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women) and waist circumference. 
- Calcium supplements may result in a small reduction in body fat mass (also known as 'stored fat'. The body uses it for energy; it insulates your body, surrounds your organs, and is just under your skin).
Only five studies investigated if calcium supplements had any unwanted effects. Results from these studies suggest there were few unwanted effects, with no clear difference between those given calcium supplements and those not given supplements. None of the included studies assessed three of the review's outcomes: participants' health-related quality of life, death by any cause, or illnesses and complications. Overall, we have little confidence in the evidence because of the small size of many studies, variations in results amongst the studies, and a lack of clarity in reporting certain aspects, such as how participants were allocated to groups in some of the studies. This evidence is current to 10 May 2023.
This review included six trials and investigated the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, as treatment for mania compared to placebo or other medicines. High withdrawal rates from the trials limit the confidence that can be placed on the results. Risperidone, both as monotherapy and combined with lithium, or an anticonvulsant, was more effective at reducing manic symptoms than placebo but caused more weight gain, sedation and elevation of prolactin levels. The efficacy of risperidone was comparable to that of haloperidol both as monotherapy and as adjunctive treatments to lithium, or an anticonvulsant. Risperidone caused less movement disorders than haloperidol but there was some evidence for greater weight gain.
This review confirms that folic acid supplementation prevents the first and second time occurrence of NTDs and shows there is not enough evidence to determine if folic acid prevents other birth defects. Information about the safety of other current and alternative supplementation schemes and any possible effects on other outcomes for mothers and babies is also lacking. This review of five trials, involving 7391 pregnancies (2033 with a history of a pregnancy affected by a NTD and 5358 with no history of NTDs), shows the protective effect of daily folic acid supplementation in doses ranging from 0.36 mg (360 µg) to 4 mg (4000 µg) a day, with and without other vitamins and minerals, before conception and up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, for preventing the recurrence of these defects. There were insufficient data to evaluate the effects on other outcomes such as cleft lip and palate, miscarriages or any other birth defects. More research is needed on different types of supplementation programmes and the use of different types of supplements (such as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate -5-MTHF), particularly in countries where folic acid fortification of staple foods like wheat or maize flour is not mandatory and where the prevalence of NTDs is still high. The overall quality of the evidence for neonatal outcomes was high for NTDs, whereas, it was of low quality for other neonatal outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence for maternal outcomes was rated as moderate.
We conducted a literature search up to September 2015 and nine studies were eligible for inclusion according to our selection criteria. The nine studies reported data on 735 participants and investigated probiotics for preventing UTI: seven studies involved women or girls with recurrent UTIs, one looked at children with abnormal urinary tracts, and one investigated UTI in healthy women. Generally, studies were poor quality with high risk of bias. Aside from the different populations, there were also many different species of probiotics used, different dosage forms such as vaginal and oral, and probiotics were given for varying lengths of time. All of these factors may have affected our results.
Most studies did not collect information on adverse effects so we were unable to estimate any harms associated with probiotic therapies. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo and no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and patients treated with antibiotics. The currently available evidence shows no reduction in UTI using probiotics.
A meta-analysis of data from 37 randomised trials including over 9000 patients was conducted. For early-stage patients, CRT resulted in longer survival and longer HD-free survival than either RT or CT alone. Second malignancy (SM) risk was lower with CRT than with RT (no difference in between CRT and CT was demonstrated). For advanced stages, no difference in survival between CRT and CT was established. With CRT, HD-free survival was longer but SM risk was higher.
We identified eight randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) reporting on 1239 participants. Five of these trials randomised participants to anticoagulation for up to three months compared with no anticoagulation. Three trials compared anticoagulation treatment for different time periods.
Our review demonstrated that in participants with distal DVT compared with no anticoagulation or placebo (pretend treatment), anticoagulation reduced the risk of recurrence of VTE. There were similar results for the recurrence of DVT, while there was no clear effect on risk of PE. This benefit was seen at the expense of an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding, but not major bleeding.
In a direct comparison of treatment duration, anticoagulation for three months or more was superior to a shorter course lasting up to six weeks, showing a reduced risk of recurrence of VTE and DVT with no clear difference in major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. For the comparison anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation or placebo, the reliability of the evidence was high for recurrence of VTE, DVT, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and low for PE and major bleeding. For the comparison anticoagulation for three months or more versus six weeks, the reliability of the evidence was high for recurrence of VTE and DVT; and low for PE, major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding, The reliability of the evidence was downgraded because of variation (or imprecision) of the results due to small numbers of events. Our review found a benefit for people with distal DVT treated with anticoagulation therapy with little or no clear difference in major bleeding events, although there was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding when compared with no treatment or placebo. The small number of participants in this meta-analysis and strength of evidence suggests more research regarding the treatment of distal DVT is needed. Randomised controlled trials comparing different treatments and different treatment periods with placebo or compression therapy are required.
Too much or too little sodium intake may affect newborn outcomes in hospital, growth and developmental outcomes. We aimed to determine the effects on sodium levels, newborn outcomes in the nursery (including death, gut and lung problems), growth and developmental outcomes of higher versus lower sodium intake in preterm infants. We searched for studies that investigated higher versus lower intake of sodium in both intravenous (with a drip into a vein) or enteral (via a tube through the mouth or nose into the gut) feeding given to premature babies. We conducted separate comparisons of studies that assessed early (less than 7 days after birth), late (7 or more days after birth), and early and late sodium supplementation. We found 4 studies with 103 babies that compared early (less than 7 days after birth), 4 studies with 138 babies that compared late (7 or more days after birth), and one study with 20 babies that reported early and late higher versus lower sodium intakes. Early (before 7 days after birth) higher sodium intake may result in more infants with high sodium levels but similar numbers of infants with low sodium levels in preterm infants. However, we are uncertain if there are any effects on infant death or other effects on infant health whilst in hospital. Few studies reported growth and longer-term infant development after discharge from hospital.
Late (7 or more days after birth) higher sodium intake may reduce the incidence of low sodium levels. We are uncertain if late higher intake affects the incidence of high sodium levels. Late higher sodium intake may reduce postnatal growth failure. We are uncertain if late higher sodium intake affects infant death or has other effects on health whilst in hospital, or longer-term infant development after discharge from hospital.
We don't know if early and late higher versus lower sodium intake affects blood sodium, growth, infant death, newborn health in hospital, and long-term outcomes. The studies in this review are all small, and many outcomes were incompletely or not reported. As a result, we are very uncertain about the effects of higher versus lower sodium intakes for premature babies on infant health whilst in hospital, including infant death, growth and longer-term infant development after discharge from hospital. More studies are needed, particularly to determine the best sodium intake in the first day after birth, the effect of higher versus lower sodium intake during the first week on hospital outcomes, growth and long-term outcomes, and the effect of higher versus intermediate sodium intake after the first week on growth, hospital outcomes and longer-term infant development after discharge from hospital. The evidence is up-to-date as of August 2022.
We found 94 randomised controlled trials comparing different luteal phase support regimens in a total of 26,198 women. Our primary outcome was live birth or ongoing pregnancy. Other outcomes were clinical pregnancy, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), miscarriage and multiple pregnancy. The evidence is current to August 2015. hCG or progesterone given during the luteal phase may be associated with higher rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy than placebo or no treatment, but the evidence is not conclusive. The addition of GnRHa to progesterone appears to improve outcomes. hCG may increase the risk of OHSS compared to placebo. Moreover hCG, with or without progesterone, is associated with higher rates of OHSS than progesterone alone. Neither the addition of oestrogen nor the route of progesterone administration appears to be associated with an improvement in outcomes. Evidence for most comparisons was of low or very low quality. The main limitations in the evidence were poor reporting of study methods and imprecision due to small sample sizes.
The review of trials found that nedocromil sodium (Tilade) inhaled 15 to 60 minutes before exercise may reduce the severity and length of this kind of asthma for both adults and children, particularly those who have severe episodes.
To answer the question, we collected all published reports of randomized trials where the drug was compared with placebo. In addition, we went back to the original data of individual patients and made one big database with all data from all patients from all trials. We included seven studies with a total of 1266 patients. The improvement of pain-free walking distance was 37% larger in the naftidrofuryl group than the improvement observed in the placebo group. In the naftidrofuryl group 55% of the patients improved by more than 50%, compared with 30% of patients on placebo. Naftidrofuryl 200 mg (taken three times a day by mouth) improved walking distance in the six months after the start of therapy.
We rated the certainty of the evidence from trials using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-certainty evidence means that we are uncertain about the results. High-certainty evidence means that we are very confident in the results.
For non-myeloablative selective HSCT and myeloablative selective HSCT we have moderate certainty in the evidence assessing overall mortality, event-free survival, functional ability, skin thickening, lung function, and serious side effects. The certainty of evidence was downgraded to moderate because of the small number of participants enrolled in the studies and the nature of the studies being unblinded for participant-reported outcomes. For non-selective non-myeloablative HSCT, the certainty of evidence was low for all outcomes. This is because of differences between the cyclophosphamide and HSCT groups before treatment along with the small number of participants enrolled in the study.
This review looked for all studies where patients were randomized to one or more treatments to measure the effects of such therapies. The questions of the review were to see whether drug treatments affected death or cardiovascular morbidity or whether there were differences between drug treatments. The available evidence was insufficient to answer these questions.
In this overview of Cochrane Reviews we examined all the evidence on how well morphine-like drugs worked, mostly when taken by mouth or through a skin patch, how many people had side effects, and how severe or troublesome those side effects were — for example, whether they caused participants to stop taking their medicines.
In May 2017, we found nine reviews with 152 included studies and 13,524 participants. The studies were often small, and compared many different preparations. They used different study designs and different ways of showing their pain results. Outcomes of importance to people with cancer pain were often not reported. For two drugs (morphine by mouth and fentanyl patches) more than 19 in 20 people had pain that went from moderate or severe before taking morphine-like drugs, to pain that was no worse than mild within 14 days if they can tolerate the side effects. Most people taking a morphine-like drug had at least one side effect. Only about 1 person in 10 to 2 people in 10 stopped taking it because of side effects. The most common side effects were constipation, and nausea and vomiting. At one level these are encouraging results, and generally agree with surveys of how well the WHO advice works in cancer pain. On another level, the quality of studies in the reviews was generally poor. We would like better study design, and especially better study reporting, which should include the outcome of pain reduced to a level where people with cancer can cope with it (no pain or mild pain).
We found that the Cochrane Reviews were of high quality.
We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. We rated the evidence in the reviews as very low quality.
We searched for trials up to 24 March 2016 that compared removing CSF via lumbar or ventricular taps in all babies at risk of developing a build-up of fluid on the brain against a conservative approach where this was only done if there was evidence that the build-up of fluid was causing an excess of pressure in the brain. We included four trials that included a total of 280 preterm infants treated in neonatal intensive care units in the UK. The trials were published between 1980 and 1990. We found no evidence that removal of CSF by lumbar or ventricular taps reduces the need for a permanent shunt to be inserted. There was also no evidence that it reduced the risk of major disability, multiple disability, or death. There was insufficient evidence to determine if this approach can lead to an increased risk of developing an infection in the CSF. We assessed the outcomes of major disability, multiple disability, and disability or death as high quality evidence.
We recorded the quality of the evidence for the outcomes of shunt insertion, and death or shunt insertion as low quality evidence, as there was an issue with the random allocation method in one included trial that reported on this outcome.
For the outcomes of death and infection of CSF presurgery, the quality of the evidence was moderate due to the previously mentioned problem with allocation. In addition these studies did not have enough patients to sufficiently answer the question. In the case of the outcome infection of CSF presurgery, the results were inconsistent between the included trials.
We included three studies in our systematic review. Altogether the studies evaluated 2971 participants, with 1467 participants allocated to the intervention groups and 1504 to the control groups. The studies had a length of intervention of 9, 12 and 24 months.
This plain language summary was current as of December 2013. The use of the TTM SOC in combination with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions in the included studies provided inconclusive evidence about the impact of such interventions on sustainable weight loss (mean difference in favour of the TTM SOC was between 2.1 kg and 0.2 kg at 24 months). However, other positive effects were noted, such as changes in physical activity and dietary habits that included increased exercise duration and frequency, reduced fat intake and increased fruit and vegetable consumption. The studies did not report other important outcomes such as health-related quality of life, illness (morbidity) and economic costs. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low or very low. The main limitations included incomplete reporting of outcomes, methodological shortcomings, extensive use of self-reported measures and insufficient assessment of sustainability due to the lack of long-term assessments.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, comparing azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in participants with clinical evidence of an acute LRTI, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. We analysed the results from 15 trials with 2496 participants. The effects of azithromycin on cure, improvement or failure were not better than those of amoxycillin or amoxyclav. However, azithromycin seems to have a lower incidence of adverse events than amoxycillin or amoxyclav but it is not significant. Overall the quality of the evidence for the main outcome is low as only three of 15 included trials showed adequate allocation concealment. Hence, currently, there is insufficient evidence to show conclusively that azithromycin is superior to amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute LRTI.
This review examines trials of these drugs for the treatment of elderly people with schizophrenia. We found three small, short trials. These did not have much information that was usable and we really could not draw any firm conclusions, except that such studies are possible and more are needed as a matter of urgency.
The studies took place in nine different countries worldwide, with adults aged 18 to 80 years, who had a diagnosis of conversion or dissociative disorder for any length of time. Some studies were conducted in either psychiatric or neurological settings. Some included people already in hospital, some included people attending outpatient clinics.
The interventions were all psychosocial, meaning that they focused on psychological or social interventions such as therapy, hypnosis or simply teaching people about their illness. The number of sessions varied.
The included studies all compared the intervention to a control group to see if the interventions made any difference. The control groups received a different psychosocial intervention, medication or the care that people would normally get if they had the same condition but were not part of a research study.
The primary outcome we looked for was a reduction in physical signs. We investigated the effect of different types of psychosocial interventions, ranging from hypnosis to behavioural therapy. None of the studies were conducted to a high enough standard to be able to say anything conclusive about the evidence of the results.
There was a reduction in physical signs at the end of treatment for three interventions.
Hypnosis reduced the severity of impairment compared to people on a wait list for treatment; behavioural therapy, given on top of routine care to inpatients, reduced the number of weekly seizures (fits) and symptom severity compared with people receiving routine care alone; and psychotherapy preceded by motivational interviewing (a talking therapy that attempts to move an person away from a state of indecision or uncertainty to positivity) compared with psychotherapy alone reduced seizure frequency. Most of the included studies had methodological flaws and the quality of evidence used to assess the effectiveness of the different treatments was judged as low or very low. Due to this low-quality evidence, we cannot say how reliable the results are. The results of the meta-analysis and reporting of single studies suggest that there is lack of evidence regarding the effects of any psychosocial intervention of conversion and dissociative disorders in adults. Therefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about potential benefits or harms from the included studies.
However, the review shows that research in this area is possible.
Some studies showed positive effects on researchers' attitudes to plagiarism. Practical training, such as using computer programs that can detect plagiarism, or writing exercises, sometimes decreased plagiarism by students but not all studies showed positive effects. We did not find any studies on fabrication or falsification. Two studies showed that the way in which journals ask authors for details about who did each part of a study can affect their responses.
Many of the studies included in this review had problems such as small sample sizes or had used methods that might produce biased results. The training methods tested in the studies (which included online courses, lectures and discussion groups) were often not clearly described. Most studies tested effects over short time periods. Many studies involved university students rather than active researchers.
In summary, the available evidence is of very low quality, so the effect of any intervention for preventing misconduct and promoting integrity in research and publication is uncertain. However, practical training about how to avoid plagiarism may be effective in reducing plagiarism by students, although we do not know whether it has long-term effects.
This review of 22 randomised clinical trials, with a combined total of 3529 patients, set out to determine if any drug was more effective than another in preventing occlusion or restenosis of the artery after the blood vessels have been surgically widened. For the majority of comparisons, only one study was available. Evidence suggests that some drugs which reduce platelet aggregation, such as higher-dose aspirin, can reduce the rate of reocclusion six months after surgery, but evidence on associated side effects and for longer-term restenosis rates is scarce. There is also some evidence of variation in effect according to different drugs, with reocclusion/restenosis rates lower in people taking cilostazol compared with ticlopidine 12 months after surgery and, in patients with more severe disease, those taking low molecular weight heparin in addition to aspirin compared with aspirin alone. Batroxobin plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone may be an effective treatment in diabetic patients. However, available trials are generally small and of variable quality and side effects of drugs are not consistently addressed. Further good quality, large-scale randomised controlled trials, grouped by severity of disease, are required.
We searched for evidence on 5 February 2018. We identified 21 randomised controlled trials from which 11,246 mother-baby pairs contributed results for this review. Examples of the additional social support include information, home visits, telephone calls and stress management. The overall quality of evidence for most outcomes was moderate. It was not possible to blind women to which group they were in.
We found that women who received additional social support during pregnancy may be slightly less likely to have a baby with low birthweight (16 studies, 11,770 babies), or give birth too early (14 studies, 12,282 babies). The number of babies that died around the time of birth was similar for both groups of women (15 studies, 12,091 babies). Women who received the additional social support were, however, probably less likely to be admitted to hospital during their pregnancy (4 studies, 787 women), or to have a caesarean birth (15 studies, 9550 women). Women with additional social support may be less likely to be depressed (1 study, 1008 women). Findings around satisfaction with care were mixed, with one study reporting the support group being more satisfied, whilst another study suggested women in the usual care group were more satisfied. The findings did not appear to be different if the social support was provided by trained lay people or health professionals. Although programmes that offer additional social support during pregnancy are unlikely to prevent the pregnancy from resulting in a low birthweight or early birth, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, they may be helpful in reducing the likelihood of antenatal hospital admissions and the need for caesarean births.
Additional social support is not powerful enough to improve the outcomes of the pregnancy during which it is provided, as measured by the outcomes considered in this review. The factors contributing to deprivation require social change in order to bring about improvements in health for mothers and their newborn babies.
It has been proven in clinical studies that this 'preoperative' radiotherapy improves the outcome in rectal cancer patients. Recently, several studies have investigated the combination of radiotherapy with chemotherapy (CRT) before surgery. In theory, adding chemotherapy enhances the antitumour activity of radiotherapy. This meta-analysis has summarized the results of five studies that compared preoperative RT alone with preoperative CRT in rectal cancer patients. All of these studies were randomized, which means that the decision to administer either RT or CRT was determined by chance (ballot draw). The results of the meta-analysis may be summarized as follows. Compared to RT alone, preoperative CRT leads to increased side effects during treatment. Also, postoperative complications are somewhat increased, although the risk of dying from postoperative complications is similar. Preoperative CRT is more effective in causing tumour shrinkage (downstaging), and in preventing local recurrence of the disease. However, addition of chemotherapy did not result in more sphincter preserving surgeries, and did not affect the overall survival in rectal cancer patients.
Study characteristics: We included five studies that compared surgical versus non-surgical treatment in a total of 643 people with lumbar spinal stenosis. Average age of participants in all studies was over 59 years. Follow-up periods ranged from six weeks to 10 years.
Key results: We cannot conclude on the basis of this review whether surgical or non-surgical treatment is better for individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis. Nevertheless, we can report on the high rate of effects reported in three of five surgical groups, ranging from 10% to 24%. No side effects were reported for any of the conservative treatment options.
Three studies compared spine surgery versus various types of non-surgical treatment. It is difficult for review authors to draw conclusions from these studies because non-surgical treatments were inadequately described. One study that compared surgery versus bracing and exercise found no differences in pain. Another study compared surgery versus spinal injections and found better physical function with injections, and better pain relief with surgery at six weeks. Still another trial compared surgery with an implanted device versus non-surgical care. This study reported favourable outcomes of surgery for symptoms and physical function.
Quality of the evidence: Evidence obtained by comparing surgery versus non-surgical treatment is of low quality. Well-designed studies are needed to examine this problem. In particular, researchers need to do a better job of describing the details of non-surgical treatments.
This review aimed to assess the effects of Xuebijing injection in people with paraquat poisoning. We identified two trials including 84 people. Although there were fewer deaths in people treated with Xuebijing injection, meta-analysis showed that it did not have a statistically significant benefit on reducing all-cause mortality in people with paraquat poisoning. Both included studies involved small numbers of participants and were considered to be of poor methodological quality. Xuebijing injection may be effective for people with paraquat poisoning, but the effects need to be proven by more high quality evidence.
The umbilical cord connects the baby and mother during pregnancy. The cord is cut after birth. The cord stump then dries and falls off, generally within five to 15 days. Infection of the umbilical cord stump (omphalitis), caused by skin bacteria, is a significant cause of illness and death in newborn babies in developing countries. This review evaluated all studies that assessed antiseptics applied topically to the umbilical cord to determine if they reduce the risk of cord infection and death. Thirty-four randomised controlled studies were included involving 69,338 babies. There were 22 different interventions studied. The most commonly studied antiseptics in the included studies were 70% alcohol, triple dye and chlorhexidine. Three studies were conducted in community settings in developing countries; the remainder were conducted in hospital settings, mostly in developed countries. Studies conducted in community settings were large and contributed about 78% of all the participants included in this review. Hospital-based studies were small and had limitations.
Studies conducted in community settings evaluated the effectiveness of topical application of chlorhexidine and combined results showed that chlorhexidine reduced risk of death by 23% and the risk of cord infection ranging from 27% to 56%, depending on the severity of infection. Topical application of chlorhexidine may increase cord separation time by about 1.7 days, however, this does not increase subsequent risk of cord infection or death.
None of the studies conducted in hospital settings reported data for risk of death or tetanus. No antiseptic was found to be advantageous for the prevention of cord infection compared with dry cord care in hospital settings. Topical triple dye application reduced bacterial colonization with Staphylococcus aureus compared to both dry cord care and alcohol application. There was no advantage of application of alcohol and triple dye for reduction of colonization with streptococcus. Topical alcohol application was advantageous in the reduction of colonization with Enterococcus coli compared with dry cord care and triple dye application. Cord separation time was increased with topical application of alcohol and triple dye compared with dry cord care in hospital settings. There were insufficient studies to determine the efficacy of other antiseptics.
The aim of this review was to compare two types of CBTp, brief CBTp and standard CBTp for people with schizophrenia. A search was run for relevant randomised studies in 2013. Only seven potentially-relevant studies were found. However, although all of them randomised people with schizophrenia, none of these studies compared brief CBTp with standard CBTp. In the main they compared brief CBTp with standard care or other therapies. There is, therefore, no information or literature available to compare brief with standard CBTp for schizophrenia and psychosis.
There is a need for large scale research and trials that compare brief CBTp with standard CBTp. This research needs to evaluate costs, have clear definitions of standard and brief CBTp and focus on the time period or number of sessions, i.e. the ‘effective dose’ of CBTp.

All five studies had weaknesses that could seriously affect the reliability of their results. We considered the evidence to be of very low quality, meaning that we are unsure of the results. The lack of reliable evidence means that we are uncertain whether one-incision arthroscopically assisted ACL techniques are any better (or worse) than two-incision techniques. Further research would help to answer this question but may not be a current priority.
It has been suggested that altering the diets of people with hypercalciuria could help to prevent complications of the condition. We therefore aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of dietary interventions that had been investigated in clinical studies. We included five studies in our review, one of which compared a low calcium diet with a diet that included normal levels of calcium, low protein, low salt over five years. This study found that diets unrestricted for calcium intake significantly decreased numbers of new kidney stones.
Other dietary interventions, such as unprocessed wheat bran, did not show any evidence of beneficial effects.
We did not find any studies in children, and none investigating specific dietary recommendations for those who had hypercalciuria without symptoms.
There are only a few good quality studies comparing the acute treatment of early episode schizophrenia with an antipsychotic medication compared to placebo or psychosocial treatment. It appears that initial medication treatment reduces the study attrition rates while also increasing the risk for medication-induced side effects. Data are too limited to assess the effects of initial antipsychotic medication treatment on outcomes for individuals with an early episode of schizophrenia.
We searched medical databases up to 19 May 2017. We included 19 studies with 1548 adults of both sexes. The participants had had operations on the abdomen (tummy), heart, blood vessels of the lungs, back, lower limbs or various surgeries. Two studies mentioned financial support from the pharmaceutical industry or from medical equipment manufacturers. We do not think that this had an effect on the results as high or low volumes may be administered with any machine. We did not find a difference in 0- to 30-day mortality (death within one month). We found that using a volume lower than 10 millilitres per kilogram of body weight reduced the risk of pneumonia (lung infection) and increased the chances that people would be able to get back to their normal respiratory status immediately after surgery. Low volumes should be used preferentially during surgery. For every 1000 people operated on, 84 would have pneumonia after the operation if high volumes were used during surgery. This number was reduced to 43 if low volumes were used instead. Likewise, the number of people needing additional non-invasive ventilatory support (through a mask applied to the face) would be reduced from 115 to 36 if volumes lower than 10 millilitres per kilogram of body weight were used during surgery and the need invasive ventilatory support (through a tube inserted in the person's windpipe) would be reduced from 39 to 13. Hospital length of stay may be slightly reduced (equivalent to almost one day). We identified no possible harmful effects of using low volumes. We judged the reliability of the evidence as moderate for pneumonia and reduced need for ventilatory support (non-invasive or invasive). Results on these three outcomes may be affected with additional data.
We searched for evidence to September 2019. We found one small, randomised controlled study that took place in a hospital in Papua New Guinea. The study involved 30 women who were undergoing the manual removal of a retained placenta. It compared an injection of the local anaesthetic, lidocaine, around the cervix (paracervical block) and intravenous medication pethidine and diazepam, for pain relief and relaxation.
This study did not report on pain intensity or adverse events.
The study did report that none of the women experienced a postpartum blood loss of more than 500 mL.
We are uncertain about the providers' satisfaction with the procedure (defined as their perception of good pain relief during the procedure), and the women's satisfaction with the procedure (defined as their perception of good pain relief during the procedure). We found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of anaesthesia or analgesia during manual removal of a retained placenta.
There is a need for further well designed, randomised controlled trials that report on the important outcomes outlined in this review.
Through June 2015, we searched for trials of education about family planning after having a baby. We also wrote to researchers to find other trials. The trials had to study how much the program affected family planning use. The program must have occurred within a month after the birth. We entered the data into RevMan and used the odds ratio to examine effect. We also looked at the quality of the research methods.
We found 12 trials with 4145 women. Eight studies were from the USA and the others were from Australia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Syria. Four trials provided one counseling session before hospital discharge. Of eight studies with more than one contact, five focused on teens. Three of the five had home visiting, one used clinic services, and one had personal and phone contacts. Of three studies with women and teens, two had home visits and one used phone contact.
Six trials had results of moderate quality. In a study with adolescents, the group with home-based mentoring had fewer second births within two years compared to the control group. Of trials with lower quality evidence, two showed some effect. In Nepal, more of the women with some counseling right after delivery may use birth control at six months than those with a session later or none. In Australia, more teens in a special home-visiting program used birth control correctly at six months than those with standard home visits.
We found moderate to low quality results overall. Most of those with some effect were low quality. Better program design and carrying out could make them stronger. Even still, some programs might cost too much for some settings.
The 2021 update includes 29 trials with 15,337 cases of sore throat. All of the included studies were randomised controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) that sought to determine if antibiotics helped reduce symptoms of sore throat, fever, or headache or the occurrence of more serious complications. The included studies were conducted in both children and adults seeking medical care for their symptoms. Many of the early studies were funded by the United States Armed Forces and recruited young, adult male military personnel. Later studies were mostly supported by governmental research grants, with a small number funded by private pharmaceutical companies. We found that antibiotics reduced the number of people still experiencing headache on the third day of illness. Antibiotics probably reduced the number of people with sore throat after three days and one week, as well as rheumatic fever within two months in communities where this complication is common. Our confidence in the evidence for antibiotic use varied from low to high for other types of complications associated with sore throat. Overall, the certainty of the evidence from the included studies was low to high. However, there were very few recent trials included in the review, hence it is unclear if changes in bacterial resistance in the community may have affected the effectiveness of antibiotics.
This review included data from 23 randomised controlled trials involving 8615 pregnant women at 37 weeks of pregnancy or more. Only three trials were at overall low risk of bias, and the evidence in the review was very low to moderate quality. For planned early birth, 10 trials used intravenous oxytocin for induction of labour, 12 trials used prostaglandins, and one trial each assessed Caulophyllum and acupuncture.
The findings showed that planned early birth for PROM at term reduced the risk of infection for pregnant women (including infection of the membranes surrounding the baby and the amniotic fluid (known as chorioamnionitis)) compared with expectant management (eight trials, 6864 women; this was rated low-quality evidence ), Planned early birth also reduced the risk of definite or possible infections for the babies (16 trials, 7314 babies, low-quality evidenc e). However, no differences were seen in the rates of caesarean births (23 trials, 8576 women, low-quality evidence ), serious illness or death for the women (three trials, 425 women, very low-quality evidence ), definite infection for the babies (six trials, 1303 babies, very low-quality evidence ), or death for the babies (eight trials, 6392 babies, moderate-quality evidence). Babies born after planned early birth were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (eight trials, 6179 babies), and both women (two trials, 748 women) and their babies (four trials, 5691 babies) had a shorter stay in hospital after planned early birth. Women had a more positive experience of planned early birth compared with expectant management (two trials, 5134 women). Planned early birth (compared with expectant management) after PROM at term may help to reduce infection for women without increasing the need for a caesarean section, and neonatal infection may also be reduced. However, evidence about longer-term effects on children is needed.
We wanted to find out how accurate cognitive assessment tools that can be completed by people themselves are at detecting dementia. We searched for studies that investigated the accuracy of self-administered cognitive assessment tools for dementia in adults (over the age of 18 years) in any healthcare setting. We found 11 studies with a total of 2303 participants that tested six different tools. Five studies looked at one test called 'Test Your Memory'; this was tested in five different languages. Two studies looked at the 'Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination'; one study tested a written version of the test and the other tested an electronic version. One study looked at each of the following cognitive assessment tools individually: the 'Clock Completion Test', 'Korean Dementia Screening Questionnaire-Cognition', 'BrainCheck Memory', and 'MyMemCheck'. These tools all have different scoring systems and some studies looked at multiple cut-off scores - to indicate whether or not the person had dementia - within each tool.
Studies took place across Europe, the USA, and South Korea. The healthcare settings included community centres, nursing homes, and hospital clinics, and some studies included multiple settings. The average age of the people taking the tests varied amongst studies from 50 to 60 years to 80 to 90 years.
We found that these cognitive assessment tools could correctly identify people with dementia between 55% and 100% of the time, and could correctly rule out dementia between 45% and 100% of the time. These ranges are due to differences in study populations, settings, type of assessment tool, and diagnostic cut-off scores (i.e. score at which dementia was diagnosed). We summarised results from three studies that used 'Test Your Memory' and found that using a cut-off score of 42/50, the assessment tool could correctly identify people with dementia around 94% of the time and correctly rule out dementia around 66% of the time. In the studies we found, the tools' diagnosis of whether a person had dementia was confirmed by a traditional, face-to-face clinical assessment for dementia. There were some problems with the methods used in some studies, including the way participants were selected for the studies, and the timings and details of the clinical assessments were not always clear. Some studies had small numbers of participants.
The test accuracy results are a summary based on evidence from the studies we examined. The results produced from individual studies varied considerably, so we cannot be sure these cognitive assessment tools will always produce the same results in clinical practice. The evidence is up to date to November 2022.
The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness and safety of helminth therapy for inducing remission in people with IBD. This review identified two randomised controlled trials including a total of 90 participants. One study compared twice weekly treatment with helminths (an 0.8 mL solution containing 2500 live eggs of the helminth Trichuris suis ) for 12 weeks to a matching placebo (an 0.8 ml identical looking solution with no Trichuris suis eggs) in 54 patients with active ulcerative colitis. Few remissions occurred during the trial and helminth treatment had no detectable effect on these remissions. Ten per cent (3/30) of patients in the helminth group achieved remission compared to four per cent (1/24) of placebo patients. A higher proportion of patients in the helminth group (43% or 13/30) improved clinically compared to the placebo group (17% or 4/24). However, this difference could be a chance effect. We could not determine whether the proportion of patients who had a side effect was higher in either group. No observed side effects were thought to be related to treatment were reported in this study. The other study compared one treatment with various doses of helminths (a solution of 500, 2500 or 7500 Trichuris suis eggs) to a matching placebo in 36 patients with Crohn's disease. This study was designed to assess side effects and did not measure clinical remission or improvement. There amount of information available on side-effects at two weeks was limited and the results were uncertain due to the small number of participants in the study. The only side effect that was judged to be possibly related to the study treatment was dysgeusia (a distortion of the sense of taste). This was reported in one patient in the helminth group and in one patient in the placebo group. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow any firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of helminths used to treat patients with IBD. The only information available relating to clinical improvement in patients with active ulcerative colitis comes from one small study. We do not know how safe helminths are when used in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Further randomised controlled trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of helminth therapy in IBD.
We searched the medical literature for clinical trials up to 19 March 2019. We found 59 randomised trials that compared BTURP with MTURP. These studies included a total of 8924 patients. The longest period of follow-up for the outcomes of interest was 12 months after treatment. Compared to MTURP, BTURP probably results in similar reduction in urinary symptoms and bother.
It probably slightly reduces both the risk of TUR syndrome and the need for blood transfusion.
Erectile function is probably similar after both procedures, as is the risk of urinary incontinence and the need for a repeat procedure. The quality of evidence for the outcomes of ability to pass urine, patient bother, TUR syndrome, need for blood transfusion, and erectile function was considered to be moderate. The quality of evidence for the outcomes of urinary leakage after the procedure and need for a repeat procedure was low.
We wanted to find out how effective interventions were in either preventing or ceasing (i.e. stopping) child and/or adolescent e-cigarette use. We also wanted to know what the effect of these interventions was on child and/or adolescent use of tobacco, and if the interventions had any consequences related to the health of children and/or adolescents, or the organisations where the interventions were being delivered. We searched for all available evidence from randomised controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) to answer the review questions. We searched for studies on 1 May 2023 and found no published studies. However, we did find 22 studies that were underway and will probably be included in future updates of the review. Given that we found no studies for inclusion, we do not know how effective interventions are in preventing or ceasing child and/or adolescent e-cigarette use. This evidence is current to 1 May 2023.
This is a living systematic review. We search for new evidence every month and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.
We searched various scientific databases from their inception to December 2019 and found 38 trials where people with coronary heart disease were randomly allocated to antibiotics versus placebo or no intervention. The 38 trials included 26,638 adults with a mean age of 61.6 years. 23 out of the 38 trials reported data on 26,078 participants that could be analysed. The vast majority of the data was contributed by trials assessing the effects of macrolide antibiotics (28 trials; 22,059 participants) and quinolone antibiotics (two trials; 4162 participants), while insufficient data were contributed by trials assessing the effects of tetracycline antibiotics (eight trials; 417 participants). Three trials were at low risk of bias and the remaining trials were at high risk of bias. Patients receiving antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics or quinolone antibiotics) compared with patients receiving placebo or no intervention seemed at a slightly higher risk of death from all causes, death from a cardiac cause, and having a stroke at maximum follow-up. Moreover, a slightly higher risk was also observed when assessing death from all causes, death from a cardiac cause, and sudden death from a cardiac cause at 24±6 months follow-up. None of the trials sufficiently reported the number of participants with serious adverse events. No data were provided on quality of life.
Future trials on the safety of macrolide antibiotics or quinolone antibiotics for the secondary prevention in adult patients with coronary heart disease do not seem ethical.
We wanted to find out if direct oral anticoagulants are useful and safe for treating people with a pulmonary embolism, compared with conventional anticoagulants. We looked at whether 3 months' treatment or longer prevented further blood clots (recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), when a clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg), recurrent pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary embolisms. The main safety outcomes included death and unwanted, harmful adverse events, such as major bleeding. We searched for studies in which people with a pulmonary embolism confirmed by standard imaging techniques were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. These types of studies give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects. People in the experimental groups received an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor, and their results were compared to the results of people given conventional anticoagulation. All participants were given long-term treatment of pulmonary embolism (a minimum duration of 3 months). After searching for relevant studies, we included 10 studies with a combined total of 13,073 participants. Studies compared oral DTIs and factor Xa inhibitors with conventional anticoagulation. We combined the data from the studies and found that there was no clear difference in the incidence of:
- recurrent pulmonary embolism;
- recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT: when a blood clot forms, usually in a deep vein of the leg or pelvis);
- recurrent venous thromboembolism (when DVT and pulmonary embolism occur together);
- death; 
- major bleeding
This review showed that there was no clear difference between the direct oral anticoagulants and conventional treatment in preventing recurrent PE, recurrent VTE, DVT, mortality, and major bleeding. No study measured health-related quality of life. We are moderately confident in this evidence. This was because the number of events involved in the studies was small and there were differences in how individual studies were carried out. This review updates a previous Cochrane Review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022. Current evidence shows there is probably little or no difference between direct oral anticoagulants and conventional anticoagulation for preventing recurrent pulmonary embolism, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), all-cause mortality, and major bleeding in people who are being treated for a pulmonary embolism.
The review author searched the medical literature to find out if aminosteroids help people with traumatic brain injury when given within seven days of the injury. The author looked for randomised controlled trials in which one group of patients received a treatment (aminosteroids) while a similar group received non-active treatment (placebo) in addition to standard care. To reduce possible bias, each patient is randomly assigned to a group. The author found two such studies, which used the aminosteroid tirilazad mesylate, but the results of one of the studies were not available at the time of review. The completed study involved 1131 patients. The results of this study showed no benefit from the aminosteroid. The aminosteroid group did not have more side effects than the placebo group but aminosteroids are fairly new drugs that may have unknown less common side effects.
More research is needed on the use of aminosteroids to treat traumatic brain injury but currently there is no evidence to recommend their use.
 .We found 12 studies suitable for inclusion with a total of 2488 participants. Twelve per cent of participants (298) had tumours in the mouth and 59% (1468) had tumours in the throat. The remaining 29% of participants had tumours of the voice box or lower part of throat and less than 1% had tumours at other sites. We grouped trials by treatment into three main comparisons: standard therapy with or without epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody (EGFR mAb) therapy (which is a targeted therapy), standard therapy with or without tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (which is a targeted therapy) and standard therapy with or without immunotherapy (which is an immune-boosting therapy). We found that adding EGFR mAb, a targeted therapy, to standard therapy may increase overall survival, cancer-free survival, keeping the cancer limited to that area of the body and may decrease recurrence of the cancer. However, it may result in an increase in skin problems for some.
There is not enough evidence to know whether TKIs added to standard therapies results in a change in overall survival, cancer-free survival, keeping the cancer limited to that area of the body or recurrence of the cancer.
One study suggested that a type of immunotherapy, rIL-2, combined with surgery, may increase overall survival. Overall, the evidence available ranges from moderate quality (for EGFR mAb) to very low quality (for TKIs and rIL-2), which limits our confidence in the reliability of our findings.
Our systematic review identified 15 randomised studies with 1550 patients comparing CRRT with IRRT. We did not find any difference between CRRT and IRRT with respect to mortality, renal recovery, and risk of haemodynamic instability or hypotension episodes.
We included five randomized controlled trials involving 1140 women with urine test results showing asymptomatic bacteriuria. Each of the five studies looked at different antibiotics; thus, we have not pooled the results. Four of the comparisons (fosfomycin versus cefuroxime; pivmecillinam versus ampicillin; cephalexin versus Miraxid® (pivmecillinam 200 mg and pivampicillin 250 mg); and cycloserine versus sulphadimidine) showed no definite advantage of one antibiotic over another for treating infection, side effects, or safety. Ampicillin compared with pivmecillinam resulted in less vomiting and was thus better tolerated by the women in one study. There was however no difference in curing present infection and preventing recurring infection in women who took ampicillin compared with those who took pivmecillinam. In another study comparing a one-day versus a seven-day course of nitrofurantoin, the longer course was better in treating bacteria in urine during pregnancy. Women receiving the shorter course had more persistent infection but no clear difference in symptomatic infection at two weeks, nausea or preterm birth.
The main outcome of interest was the effect of MHFA training on the mental health and well-being of individuals at a time point between six months and a year. We included three comparisons: MHFA versus no intervention; MHFA versus an alternative intervention designed to improve mental health literacy; and MHFA versus an active control, for example training in physical first aid. We only found very low-certainty evidence regarding this outcome, and it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions. The evidence we found only related to our comparison of MHFA with no intervention. We did not find any evidence relating to mental health service usage or adverse effects at the same time point. We are not confident in the evidence, firstly because there were problems in the way in which the research had been carried out which might bias their results. Secondly, there were variations in the results from different studies that we could not explain. Thirdly, because many studies did not include large number of participants, we were not able to obtain precise results that would tell us whether MHFA training was better than the interventions to which it was compared. The lack of evidence around adverse effects is a limitation, as we cannot assume that any type of intervention does not have the potential to cause harm. Further research is needed to better understand the possible effects of MHFA.
The review of trials attempted to cover all these. The authors identified 22 small trials involving 2676 people, with 19 of the trials taking place in resource-poor countries. Permethrin appeared to be the most effective topical treatment for scabies, and ivermectin appeared to be an effective oral treatment. However, ivermectin is unlicensed for this indication in many countries. Adverse events such as rash, vomiting, and abdominal pain were reported, but the trials were too small to properly assess serious but rare potential adverse effects. No trials of herbal or traditional medicines were identified for inclusion.
A total of 10,187 randomised participants from the 62 trials has been included. Maximum duration of intervention was 18 months. The reviewers suggest that supplementation appears to produce a small but consistent weight gain. There was no evidence in this updated review of a beneficial effect on mortality overall, but there may be a beneficial effect on mortality in people who are undernourished. Supplementation may also reduce the number of complications. The reported acceptance of supplements was variable between trials. Some adverse effects such as nausea or diarrhoea were reported. However, there were problems of study design and quality. More studies are required to confirm the beneficial effect on the number of complications, to establish whether there is a beneficial effect on mortality for undernourished elderly people and to provide evidence about whether protein and energy supplements can improve morbidity and functional status in frail older people.
We searched the medical literature for studies that compared the effects of corticosteroids against:
- a placebo (dummy) treatment; or
- no treatment.
We compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. We found 27 studies that involved 11,272 women and 11,925 infants. The studies were set in 21 different countries, which included high-, middle- and low-income countries.
Infant health
Robust evidence shows that corticosteroids:
- reduce perinatal deaths (numbers of stillbirths and babies dying in the first 28 days of life);
- reduce neonatal deaths (numbers of babies dying in the first 28 days of life);
- reduce serious breathing problems in the first hours of life;
- have little to no effect on babies’ birth weight.
Corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of:
- bleeding inside the brain;
- developmental delay in later childhood.
We are only moderately confident about these two findings, either because:
- the infants in the studies may not have been representative of all babies born prematurely; or
- studies may have been conducted in ways that introduced errors into their results.
Maternal health
The evidence indicates that corticosteroids probably do not affect the risk of:
- mothers dying after giving birth;
- developing chorioamnionitis (inflammation or infection of the tissues that surround the baby in pregnancy);
- developing endometritis (inflammation of the lining of the uterus).
We are only moderately confident about these three findings because they are based on few events. Until we have more evidence from more women, we cannot be certain that there is no difference in risk.
We found little evidence about:
- women who were pregnant with multiple babies; women with high blood pressure; or women whose membranes surrounding the baby broke early;
- the effects of corticosteroids in babies born prematurely versus very prematurely;
- different doses of corticosteroids.
This means that we cannot be certain that the findings in this review apply to all women and babies at risk of premature birth. Nor can we determine which dose of corticosteroids is best. Corticosteroids given to women at risk of premature birth improve the chances that, once they are born, their babies will be able to breathe and survive.
The evidence available suggests that corticosteroids are probably not associated with risks for the baby or mother. Further evidence is needed about:
- whether corticosteroids work differently for women who expect multiple babies or who have high blood pressure;
- whether the benefits and risks of corticosteroids are the same when babies are born very prematurely, or less prematurely;
- which dose of corticosteroids works best. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to September 2020.
A visual summary of some of the results from this review can be found here.
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) that compared heated and cold CO2. We analysed data from the trials for changes in core temperature. We also compared post-operative pain scores and pain medication requirements, length of hospital stay, length of surgery and fogging of the surgical video camera lens. Evidence is current to September 2016. We identified and included 22 trials. There was an increase of 0.31 °C in the heated, humidified CO2 group compared to the cold CO2 group but the data were heterogeneous (highly variable). However, if the analysis was limited to the eight low-risk-of-bias studies that reported core temperatures, no significant difference was found. Also, there was no temperature difference for heated and non-humidified gas compared to cold gas.
There was no difference in postoperative pain with heated or cold insufflation. However, pain medication use was higher in only the heated, non-humidified group on postoperative days one and two.
Heated gas apparently did not change length of hospitalisation, lens fogging or length of operation. Recovery room stay was shorter with heated gas but the data was heterogeneous (highly variable). When we only included studies at low risk of bias, the data became homogeneous (less variable) and the recovery room time was not significantly different between the heated and cold gas groups. While heated, humidified gas leads to slightly smaller decreases in core body temperatures, this does not account for improvement in any patient outcomes. Therefore, there is no clear evidence for the use of heated gas insufflation, with or without humidification, in laparoscopic abdominal surgery.
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials in October 2019 and identified 10 trials (involving 3034 breastfeeding women). Most trials reported how many women were diagnosed with mastitis but there was almost no information about adverse effects, breast pain, duration of breastfeeding, nipple damage, breast abscess or recurrence of mastitis. Some trials were industry funded.
Three trials (1038 women) compared probiotics to placebo. Results for the biggest of these trials (639 women) are currently unavailable because of a contractual agreement between the probiotics supplier and the trialists. Probiotics may reduce the risk of mastitis compared with placebo (low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if probiotics reduce the risk of breast pain or nipple damage because the certainty of evidence is very low.
The risk of mastitis may be similar between antibiotics and usual care or placebo (low-certainty evidence). The risk of mastitis may be similar between antibiotics and fusidic acid ointment, antibiotics and mupirocin ointment, fusidic acid ointment and breastfeeding advice, mupirocin ointment and breastfeeding advice, fusidic acid and mupirocin, a single session of specialist breastfeeding education and routine care, anti-secretory factor-inducing cereal and standard cereal, but we are not certain about these results because they come from trials with small numbers of participants and the quality of evidence is low.
Acupoint massage probably reduces the risk of mastitis and breast pain compared with routine care (moderate-certainty evidence).
Breast massage and low frequency pulse treatment may reduce the risk of mastitis compared with routine care (low-certainty evidence). Acupoint massage probably helps to prevent mastitis and breast pain, probiotics may be better than placebo and breast massage and low frequency pulse treatment may be better than routine care. However, in general, we cannot be sure what the most effective treatments are for preventing mastitis because the certainty of evidence is low due to risk of bias, low numbers of women participating in the trials, and large differences between the treatments which make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons. We are also unsure about the true effectiveness of probiotics because we know of at least one probiotics trial whose results are not publicly available.
This review includes evidence up to 4 December 2017. We included five randomised controlled trials with a total of 805 children with recurring acute middle ear infections. All studies were performed before the introduction of vaccination against pneumococcus, a bacterium that commonly causes ear infections. Surgical removal of the adenoids was not performed in both groups in any of the trials. We primarily looked at the difference in the proportion of children who had no further acute middle ear infections at three to six months follow-up (intermediate-term), and who had a persisting perforation (hole) in the ear drum. We also looked at some other outcomes, including the proportion of children who had no further episodes of acute middle ear infection.
Grommets versus active monitoring
We found low-quality evidence that fewer children who were treated with grommets had further episodes of ear infection at six and 12 months follow-up than those managed with active monitoring; three and eight children needed to be treated with grommets to benefit one, respectively. The number of ear infections at six and 12 months follow-up was also lower in the grommets group; the difference was, however, at best modest with around one fewer episode at six months and a less noticeable effect by 12 months (low to very low-quality evidence ). Children treated with grommets did not have better quality of life at four or 12 months follow-up (low-quality evidence).
Grommets versus antibiotic prophylaxis
It is uncertain whether or not grommets are more effective than antibiotic prophylaxis; we found very low-quality evidence that fewer children who were treated with grommets had further ear infections at six months than those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (preventative antibiotics); five children needed to be treated with grommets to benefit one. The number of ear infections at six months, however, did not significantly differ between children treated with grommets and those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (very-low quality evidence).
Grommets versus placebo drugs
We found very low-quality evidence that fewer children who were treated with grommets had further ear infections at six months than those receiving placebo drugs; three children needed to be treated with grommets to benefit one. The number of ear infections at six months was also lower in the grommets group; the difference was however at best modest with around one fewer episode (very low-quality evidence).
Negative effects of grommets were not systematically reported in the studies. Two studies reported on the number of children with a persistent perforation of the ear drum; this occurred in 0% (0/54) and 4% (3/76) of children receiving grommets, respectively (low-quality evidence). We judged the quality of the evidence on the benefits and harms of placement of grommets in both ears for children with recurring acute middle ear infections to be low to very low due to study limitations (risk of bias) and the small to very small sample sizes of included studies (leading to imprecise effect estimates). This means that the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution since the true effects of grommets in this group of children may be different than the numbers presented.
We identified nine trials that compared fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy with four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In these nine studies, 855 participants were included. Four hundred and twenty seven participants underwent fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy while the remaining 428 participants underwent four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The choice of the treatment that the participants received was determined by a method similar to toss of a coin so that the two treatments were given to participants with similar characteristics. Most of these studies included low anaesthetic risk patients undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully in more than 90% of participants in most of the trials. The remaining participants were mostly converted to four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy but some participants had to undergo open cholecystectomy (through a large incision in the abdomen). There was no mortality in either group in the seven trials that reported mortality (634 participants in the two groups). There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who developed serious complications, quality of life between 10 and 30 days after operation, proportion of participants in whom the laparoscopic operation had to be converted to open cholecystectomy, or in the length of hospital stay between the groups. Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy took about 15 minutes longer to complete than four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The time taken to return to normal activity was one day shorter and time taken to return to work two days shorter in the fewer-than-four-ports group compared with four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There was no significant difference in the cosmetic appearance between the two groups at 6 to 12 months after surgery. There appears to be no advantage of fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of decreasing surgical complications, hospital stay, or in improving quality of life and cosmetic appearance. In contrast, the safety of fewer-than-four port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is yet to be established. Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy cannot be recommended routinely outside well-designed clinical trials. Most of the trials were of high risk of bias, that is, there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions because of the way that the trial was conducted. The overall quality of evidence was very low. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials (which have low probability to arrive at wrong conclusions because of chance and because of participant or researcher prejudice) are necessary to determine whether fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe and whether there is any advantage of fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy over four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the review question. We found 22 clinical trials that assessed the safety and benefit of LLLT when compared to a placebo (pretend treatment) or another non-surgical treatment for CTS. Non-surgical treatments included ultrasound (delivery of sound waves to relieve pain), fascial manipulation (massage of deep connective tissue), application of a pulsed magnetic field, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS; delivery of electrical current through skin to nerves), steroid injection, tendon gliding exercises (to improve the movement of the nerve), and applying a wrist splint combined with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (pain killers that reduce inflammation). The trials involved 1153 participants. Most of these studies had weaknesses that could have compromised their results and caused them to overestimate or underestimate benefits or harms. We assessed the quality of the evidence as low quality or very low quality, due to poorly conducted studies, issues with study designs including lack of blinding (participants or assessor may have known which treatment was given and thereby anticipated the results), dissimilar results across studies, and not enough participants and therefore data. We are uncertain whether LLLT improves symptoms of CTS more than placebo in the short term as the quality of the evidence is very low. Similarly, we are uncertain whether LLLT is less effective than ultrasound treatment in the short term as the quality of evidence Is very low. We do not know whether LLLT is better or worse than any other non-surgical treatment as evidence is lacking. There is also not enough evidence to draw any conclusions about any long-term benefits or harms of LLLT. There is not enough evidence to draw any conclusions about the adverse events a participant may experience from using LLLT. We need more well-designed, well-conducted research to find out how effective and safe LLLT is in the management of CTS.
We identified 13 studies comparing patients treated with and without the use of a PAC that studied a total of 5686 patients. These were studies of patients undergoing routine major surgery (eight) and studies of patients who were critically ill and admitted to ICUs (five). We analysed the studies for any trial related risks and performed appropriate statistical analysis to minimize any risk of bias or errors. The quality of evidence is high from this review and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect except for cost analysis.
Our review found that there were no differences in the number of deaths during hospital stay, days spent in general ICUs, and days spent in hospital between patients who did and did not have a PAC inserted. Two US studies were analysed for hospital cost associated with or without a PAC and showed no difference in the cost. Neither group of patients studied showed any evidence of benefit or harm from using a PAC. The catheter is a monitoring tool that helps in diagnosis and is not a treatment modality. Insertion of PACs to help make treatment decisions in ICU patients should be individualized and should be done by experts in the field after adequate training in the interpretation of data. Studies need to be conducted to identify subgroups of ICU patients who can benefit, when the device is used in combination with standardized treatment plans, in reversing shock states and improving organ function.
This review looked at using of rhGH to improve lung function, growth and quality of life for children and young adults with CF. It includes eight trials with 291 individuals with CF being selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The individuals in the trials were five to 23 years old, but most had not yet reached puberty. Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. Treatment with rhGH was compared to no treatment in seven trials and to a placebo (a liquid that did not contain any growth hormone) in one trial. The trial that used a placebo compared it to two different doses of rhGH treatment. Results showed a modest improvement in height, weight and lean body mass between six and 12 months. However, there was no consistent evidence that rhGH treatment improves lung function, muscle strength, or quality of life. The trials were small and we did not find any evidence on changes in glucose metabolism or the long-term risk of diabetes due to the treatment. Given these results, we are not able to identify any clear benefit of therapy and believe that more research from well-designed, adequately powered clinical trials is needed. We did not have enough information to decide if overall the trials were biased in a way that might affect the results. All the measured outcomes were clearly reported in the trials, but the trials were small and did not have enough participants to show a difference that may not have been due to chance. We also had concerns that outcomes that were based on personal judgment, such as quality of life scores, might be affected because those taking part in seven of the trials were able to tell which group they were in.
We identified 17 studies involving 988 overweight or obese adults with CKD looking at whether weight loss interventions improved their health. Studies included adults with CKD stages 1 to 4 or kidney transplant recipients. None of the studies included participants who were undergoing dialysis or supportive care. Weight loss interventions included weight loss diets, physical activity programs, drugs to suppress appetite, and weight loss surgery. The main outcomes we were interested in were death, cardiovascular events, weight loss, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, protein in the urine (proteinuria), and blood pressure (BP).
After combining the available studies, its uncertain whether weight loss interventions helped people live longer or prevented cardiovascular events such as heart complications or stroke as none of the included studies measured these outcomes. We found when compared to no weight loss interventions, weight loss interventions may lead to more weight loss. There were little or no differences seen in BMI, waist circumference, proteinuria, or BP. We found that weight loss surgery achieved more weight loss than non-surgical interventions. However, many of the studies included in this review were limited by small participant numbers, high risk of bias and inconsistent reporting of outcome measures leading to the overall quality of the evidence to be very low. This means that we cannot be sure that future studies would find similar results. The evidence is not very certain but suggests that compared with usual care or control those who participated in weight loss interventions may experience some health benefits including improvements in body weight. Whether these benefits help reduce cardiovascular outcomes and the risk of death remains uncertain and require further study.
We searched for trials in May 2016 and identified 49 trials Inlcuding around 19,000 participants. All the trials involved one or more face-to-face counselling sessions lasting at least 10 minutes, but most were much longer. Many also included further telephone contact for additional support. Thirty-three of the trials compared individual counselling to a control group that only had minimal support, which could be usual care, brief advice about stopping smoking, or written materials. Of these, 27 did not offer any medication such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), which also helps people stop. Six of the 33 provided NRT or other medication to everyone in the trial. Twelve studies compared more intensive to less intensive counselling, and five compared different types of counselling. Combining the results of the studies showed that having individual counselling could increase the chance of quitting by between 40% and 80%, compared to minimal support. This means that if seven out of 100 smokers managed to quit for at least six months using the sort of brief support given to the control groups, then between 10 and 12 in 100 would be expected to be successful after having counselling. We judged the quality of this evidence to be high. If everyone also had NRT or other medication, and 11 in 100 could quit in the control group, between 11 and 16 in 100 would be expected to be successful with the addition of counselling. We assessed this evidence as being of moderate quality, because the size of benefit was less certain. Having more intensive counselling support, for example more sessions, probably helps more, but the additional benefit is likely to be small, and again was of moderate quality because the size of benefit was uncertain. The few studies that compared different types of counselling did not show any differences between them.
This Cochrane Review is current to September 2021. There are 16 studies (1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years) including three groups - healthy children with painless flat feet; children with arthritis and painful flat feet; others (developmental coordination disorder; painful flat feet). The studies were conducted across the USA, Australia, India, Iran, Turkey, UK, and Republic of Korea. We found information about footwear, exercises, and different types of foot orthoses.  (CFOs) to shoes in painless flat feet:
Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months:
12% fewer children with CFOs were without pain (ranging from 26% fewer to 5.5% more)
67 out of 100 children were without pain with CFOs compared to 79 children out of 100 with shoes.
Withdrawal due to side effects (3 trials, 211 children):
3% more children with CFOs withdrew from treatment due to side effects (ranging from 4% fewer to 13% more) .
72 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with CFOs compared with 69 children out of 100 with shoes. Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months:
5% fewer children with PFOs were without pain (ranging from 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more)
74 out of 100 children were without pain with PFOs compared to 79 out of 100 children with shoes.
Withdrawal due to side effects (4 trials, 338 children):
0.7% fewer children with PFOs withdrew from treatment due to side effects (ranging from 15.2% fewer to 16.6% more).
71 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with PFOs compared with 72 out of 100 children with shoes. Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months:
7% fewer children with CFOs were without pain (ranging from 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more)
68 out of 100 children were without pain with CFOs compared to 74 out of 100 children with PFOs.
Withdrawal due to side effects (1 trial, 118 children):
0% fewer children withdrew from treatment with CFOs due to side effects (ranging from 9.2% fewer to 11% more).
91 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with CFOs compared with 91 out of 100 children with PFOs.
Function, quality of life, treatment success and side effects were not reported in these trials In healthy children with painless flat feet, low to very low-quality evidence shows that compared to shoes, CFOs and PFOs result in no difference in the proportion without pain or withdrawal due to side effects from treatment. The quality of the evidence is very low to low, weakening conclusions. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because the trials were poorly conducted and there were not enough data.
A number of studies have been carried out to investigate the effects of exercise both during and after treatment. The current review was carried out to evaluate the effect of physical exercise on fatigue related to cancer. Fifty-six studies, involving a total of 4068 participants, were included in this review. Results suggest that physical exercise such as aerobic walking and aerobic cycling can help to reduce fatigue both during and after treatment for cancer. The benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed specifically for people with breast cancer and prostate cancer.
Review authors identified 28 randomized controlled trials involving 3497 critically ill patients with circulatory failure, among whom 1773 died. Patients were followed up to one year.
The following drugs, given alone or in combination, were studied in 12 different comparisons: dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, vasopressin, and terlipressin. In summary, researchers found no significant differences in risk of dying in any comparisons of different drugs given alone or in combination when latest reported death was considered.
Disturbances in the rhythm of the heart were observed more frequently in people treated with dopamine than in those treated with norepinephrine. The quality of the evidence was high for the comparison of norepinephrine and dopamine, and was very low to moderate for the other comparisons.
Findings were consistent among the few large studies and studies of different quality.
A review of the literature was undertaken to determine how effective rectal 5-ASA (e.g. enemas, suppositories or foam) is for treating distal UC. Thirty-eight studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Pooled results from these studies show that rectal 5-ASA is superior to placebo (fake suppositories, enemas or foam) for improving symptoms, improving the appearance of the bowel lining at colonoscopy, and improving the appearance of biopsies of the bowel examined microscopically. Rectal 5-ASA is also superior to rectal steroids for improving symptoms. Side effects were generally mild in nature and included abdominal pain or distention, nausea and anal discomfort or irritation. From these results, it was concluded that rectal 5-ASA should be a first-line treatment for patients with mild to moderately active distal UC.
The review of 16 randomised controlled trials found no evidence that depot versus daily GnRHa injections produce different rates of live birth/ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). However, substantial differences could not be ruled out. For example, for a woman with a 25% chance of achieving a live birth or ongoing pregnancy using GnRHa depot, the corresponding chance using daily injection would be between 16% and 30%. For a woman with a 25% risk of severe OHSS using GnRHa depot, the corresponding risk using daily injection would be between 4% and 89%. For a woman with a 25% chance of achieving a live birth or ongoing pregnancy using daily GnRHa injections, the corresponding chance using a depot injection would be between 19% and 30% . For a woman with a 25 % chance of severe OHSS using daily GnRHa injections, the corresponding chance using GnRHa depot would be between 9 % and 45 % . Depot GnRHa may increase the cost of an IVF cycle, because it lengthens the period to ovulation and requires the use of higher doses of other hormone drugs. The quality of the studies was unclear due to poor reporting, and only four studies reported live births.
We included nine randomised controlled trials (20,101 employees) and nine cohort studies (1280 employees) that examined the effects of training and the use of assistive devices on preventing low-back pain and reducing back-related disability. We found no studies that examined the effects of training or the use of assistive devices as part of a treatment plan for back pain.
We found moderate quality evidence that reports of back pain, back-related disability or absence from work were similar between groups who received training on proper lifting techniques and assistive devices compared to a control group that received either no training, minor advice only, professional education, exercise training or back belts. Reports of back pain were also similar between those who received intensive training and those who received shorter instruction. These findings were consistent when measured in the short-term or long-term and when examined in randomised trials or cohort studies.
These results are similar to other reviews that examined a range of possible prevention measures. Some of the other reviews found that workers who received training were satisfied and demonstrated increased knowledge on the subject, but this did not appear to consistently translate into behaviour change.
In conclusion, training workers in proper material handling techniques or providing them with assistive devices are not effective interventions by themselves in preventing back pain. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
However, there is no direct evidence that has proven that these outcomes are valid because there have been no long-term trials that have shown that an improvement in these tests translates into reduced mortality or morbidity. Patients who fail to have sustained viral responses after an initial course of therapy do become potential candidates for retreatment; some of them may be intolerant to ribavirin, and possibly even the newer protease inhibitors, so retreatment would have to be with interferon alone. It has also been speculated that long-term treatment (namely treatment for several years) might be beneficial; such long-term therapy would be further complicated if multiple drugs were used because of the additional drug toxicities and costs, so interferon alone could be considered. This review addressed the ability of interferon monotherapy to favorably alter the clinical course of chronic hepatitis C when it is used to retreat patients who failed at least one previous course of therapy. Seven trials were identified, including two large ones (a total of 1676 patients), known as "HALT-C" and "EPIC3", that specifically were designed to use low-dose pegylated interferon for three to five years in patients with evidence on liver biopsy of severe fibrosis and who had failed to have a sustained viral response to a course of standard combination (pegylated interferon plus ribavirin) therapy in the past. Both trials were at low risk of bias. A third trial designed to address the use of pegylated interferon monotherapy for 48 weeks in improving survival in patients with cirrhosis (Childs A or B) was terminated early because of the results of the HALT-C and EPIC3 trials, so three trials have provided mortality and hepatic morbidity data. When all three trials were considered, there was no significant effect of the treatment on either all-cause mortality (78/843 (9.3%) versus 62/867 (7.2%); risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.79; 3 trials) or hepatic mortality (41/532 (7.7%) versus 40/552 (7.2%); RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.63; 2 trials); however, all-cause mortality was higher in the recipients of the pegylated interferon (78/828 (9.4%) versus 5 7/848 (6.7%); RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.96) when only the two low risk of bias trials were considered. The excess deaths appeared to be from non-liver causes. Variceal bleeding occurred less often in the treated patients (4/843 (0.5%) versus 18/867 (2.1%); RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67), but there were no differences seen with regard to the subsequent development of other manifestations of end-stage liver disease (that is, encephalopathy, ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation). One trial reported quality of life data; the treated patients had increases in their pain scores. No cost data were available. The recipients of the pegylated interferon generally had more adverse events; statistically significant differences were seen for the occurrence of hematologic complications, infections, flu-like symptoms, and rashes. Those receiving interferon were more likely to have sustained viral responses (20/557 (3.6%) versus 1/579 (0.2%); RR 15.38, 95% CI 2.93 to 80.71) and were also more likely to have improvements in markers of inflammation. No difference was demonstrated regarding the effect of the treatment on markers of fibrosis. The use of longer-term (several years) interferon monotherapy in patients with severe underlying hepatic fibrosis who have failed previous courses of treatment is not supported by the evidence; no trials providing data regarding clinical outcomes were identified in other potential treatment scenarios. Two of the commonly employed surrogate markers, sustained viral response and markers of inflammation, failed to be validated since they improved even though the clinical outcomes did not (or may even have become worse). This failure to validate the sustained viral response in this group of patients with a low sustained viral response rate suggests that the presumed validity of the use of sustained viral responses in other groups of patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infections who receive treatment must be formally validated.
In September 2017 we searched for clinical trials where combinations of medicines were used for fibromyalgia pain in adults. We found 16 studies evaluating combinations of drugs versus one drug for fibromyalgia pain. These studies looked at combinations of all sorts of different drugs, but did not provide enough data to draw any conclusions. Many of the studies did not directly compare a combination of drugs with each single drug. They sometimes compared a combination of medicines with only one of the medicines in the combination, or with only placebo. This limited our ability to make any conclusions.
Most studies did not report any of the outcomes important to people with fibromyalgia. Some studies showed that a combination of drugs is better at reducing pain than one drug alone, but other studies showed that one drug alone is better than a combination of drugs. Other studies did not find any difference between combinations of drugs and single drugs.
Side effects were not severe, and generally were not different between combination therapy and monotherapy. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Overall, the quality of evidence for important outcomes was very low. None of the combinations of drugs provided enough information for our preferred outcomes. We think that new studies will be very likely to change any conclusions drawn from these studies.
We included 32 trials (2281 participants), published up to November 2019.
Twelve trials compared shock wave therapy to placebo. Eleven trials compared high- and low-dose shock wave therapy, although dosages varied across trials. Single trials compared shock wave therapy to other treatments including ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid needling, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), exercise, or no treatment; or different regimens of shock wave therapy.
Overall, 61% of participants were women, the average age was 52 years, and the average duration of the condition was 33 months. Two trials were funded by manufacturers of shock wave machines. Participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater (one trial):
• four more people out of 100 reported pain relief of 50% or more (ranging from 19 fewer to 26 more).
42 out of 100 people reported pain relief of 50% or greater with shock wave therapy compared with 38 out of 100 with placebo.
Pain (higher scores mean more pain) (nine trials):
• Improved pain by 8% (ranging from 2% better to 14% better) or 0.78 points better (ranging from 0.17 better to 1.4 better) on a 0- to 10-point scale.
People who had shock wave therapy rated their pain as 2.2 points and people who had placebo rated their pain as 3 points.
Function (ability to use the shoulder; higher scores meanbetter function) (nine trials):
• Improved by 8% (ranging from 1.6% to 14%) or 8 points better (ranging from 1.6 better to 14 better) on a 0- to 100-point scale.
People who had shock wave therapy rated their function as 74 points and people who had placebo rated their function as 66 points.
Participant-reported success (six trials):
• 15% (ranging from 3% fewer to 49% more) more people reported their treatment a success.
41 out of 100 people reported treatment success with shock wave therapy and 26 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo.
Withdrawals due to side effects (seven trials):
• 3% fewer (ranging from 6% fewer to 3% more) people withdrew from treatment due to side effects.
8 out of 100 people withdrew from treatment with shock wave therapy and 10 out of 100 people withdrew from the placebo group.
Side effects (five trials):
• 19% more people reported side effects (ranging from 7% more to 40% more):
26 out of 100 people had a side effect with shock wave therapy and seven out of 100 people had a side effect with placebo. In people with rotator cuff disease, moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded due to bias) shows that shock wave therapy probably does not improve pain and function compared with placebo, and low-certainty evidence (downgraded due to bias and lack of accuracy) shows there may be no improvement in those with a pain reduction of 50% or more and participant-reported success. We are uncertain if withdrawals or side effects differed between groups due to small number of events. It did not appear to matter if participants had calcific deposits or not. We are uncertain if higher doses of shock wave therapy have benefits with more side effects compared with lower doses, as there was only low- or very low-certainty evidence available, and we cannot recommend a particular treatment dose.
Side effects included treatment-related pain, bruising and bleeding although these were generally minor and short-lived. Rare and serious side effects, including loss of blood supply and bone death, while possible, were not reported.
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the effects of long-term treatment with different blood thinners on blood clot recurrence in people with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (a blood clot in the limbs) or pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs). We included trials with any type of cancer, and irrespective of the type of cancer treatment. The trials looked at survival, recurrent blood clot, bleeding and blood platelet levels (which are involved in blood clotting). The evidence was current to May 2021. We found 18trials enrollingparticipants with cancer and blood clots. The studies found that low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs; a type of blood thinner that is injected into a vein) were superior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; a type of blood thinner taken by mouth (oral)) in reducing the recurrence of blood clots. The available data did not provide a clear answer about the effects of these drugs on death and the side effect of bleeding. The studies also found that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; another type of blood thinner taken by mouth) might decrease the recurrence of blood clots compared to LMWH while increasing the risk of bleeding. There was no clear answer when comparing DOACs (a newer type of oral blood thinner) and VKAs (an older type of oral blood thinner) for death, blood clot recurrence and bleeding. When comparing LMWHs to VKAs, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be moderate for recurrent blood clots, death at one year and major bleeding, and low for minor bleeding.
When comparing DOACs to VKAs, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low for death, recurrent blood clots and bleeding complications.
Editorial note: this is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.
After searching for all relevant studies up to October 2013, we found nine studies that reviewed the effect of electromagnetic field treatment compared to a sham or fake treatment in 636 adults with osteoarthritis for a duration of 4 to 26 weeks.  - Electromagnetic fields probably relieve pain in osteoarthritis.
- People who received electromagnetic field treatment experienced pain relief of 15 points more compared with people who received fake treatment (15% improvement).
- People who received electromagnetic field treatment rated their pain to be 26 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100.
- People who received fake treatment rated their pain to be 11 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100. - Electromagnetic fields may improve physical function but this may have happened by chance. - Electromagnetic fields probably make no difference to overall health and well-being. - Electromagnetic fields probably make no difference to whether people have side effects or stop taking the treatment because of side effects, but this may have happened by chance.
We do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects could include skin rash and aggravated pain. There was no information available on whether electromagnetic fields show any improvement to a joint with osteoarthritis on an X-ray. - Electromagnetic fields probably improve pain and make no difference to overall health and well-being and side effects. This may change with further research.
- Electromagnetic fields may improve physical function. This is very likely to change with further research.
We searched for evidence up to September 2017 and found five randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing MBSR to a variety of other interventions. We reported the effects of MBSR programmes compared with active controls (interventions in which participants received a similar amount of attention to those in the MBSR group, such as social support or progressive muscle relaxation) or inactive controls (interventions in which participants received less attention than those in the MBSR group, such as self help education). We were able to analyse study data from five randomised controlled trials involving a total of 201 carers. Findings from three studies (135 carers) showed that carers receiving MBSR may have a lower level of depressive symptoms at the end of treatment than those receiving an active control treatment. However, we found no clear evidence of any effect on depression when MBSR was compared with an inactive control treatment. Mindfulness-based stress reduction may also lead to a reduction in carers' anxiety symptoms at the end of treatment. Mindfulness-based stress reduction may slightly increase carers' feelings of burden. However, the results on anxiety and burden were very uncertain. We were unable to draw conclusions about carers' coping strategies and the risk of dropping out of treatment due to the very low quality of the evidence.
None of the studies measured quality of life of carers or people with dementia, or the rate of admission of people with dementia to care homes or hospitals.
Only one included study reported on adverse events, noting one minor adverse event (neck strain in one participant practising yoga at home) We considered the quality of the evidence to be low or very low, mainly because the studies were small and the way they were designed or conducted put them at risk of giving biased results. Consequently, we have limited confidence in the results. To summarise, the review provides preliminary evidence on the effect of MBSR in treating some stress-related problems of family carers of people with dementia. More good-quality studies are needed before we can confirm whether or not MBSR is beneficial for family carers of people with dementia.
We performed a systematic search of the medical literature in July 2020 and found no studies that could be included in this review. We found no clinically useful evidence from randomised clinical trials. The clinical benefit of BtA treatment for HFS has not been properly addressed in randomised clinical trials.
We did not systematically search for data from other sources of evidence, which, by definition, are more prone to bias and carry a higher level of uncertainty. Observational studies suggest that BtA is effective and safe in this setting. Future randomised studies should evaluate the impact on outcomes that are relevant for people with HFS, and help to guide clinical practice in the selection of the BtA formulation, dose, and technique of administration
We wanted to compare sealants with other types of techniques or materials used to stop bleeding in vascular surgery. We included 24 clinical trials that randomized 2376 participants and combined their results together using a standardized process to determine how effective sealants were in stopping bleeding in vascular surgery. The trials included anastomoses in vascular surgery and were primarily carried out in the United States and Europe, with a few taking place in the United Kingdom, Japan, and other countries. Using sealants may result in faster time to stopping bleeding in the anastomoses, and sealants were potentially less likely to fail at stopping bleeding in comparison to other techniques or materials. However, using sealants did not clearly result in less bleeding, less operating time, less bleeding following surgery during recovery for 30 days, or lower likelihood of having to go back to the operating room for bleeding complications during recovery for 30 days. None of the studies reported any deaths because of sealant use, and none of the studies investigated whether using sealants provided a better quality of life for patients. Most studies did not specify how they randomized participants, or how they kept the randomization process hidden. This is important because randomizing participants properly, and keeping the process hidden, can make us more confident that the study is determining only the difference in the techniques and not something else. No studies prevented the surgeons or staff from knowing which technique or material was being used to stop bleeding. This is important because awareness of which technique or material was being used can influence the surgeons' or staff's judgment of how effective they are. Thirteen of the studies had high rates of participants not completing their follow-up time period, or not completing the study for other reasons. All the studies had risk factors for introducing other sources of bias into the study.
As a result, the certainty of evidence was low or very low for all the outcomes. We searched for studies up to March 2023.
We included eight studies which covered a variety of monitoring strategies in a wide range of clinical trials, including national and large international trials. They included primary (general), secondary (specialized), and tertiary (highly specialized) health care. The size of the studies ranged from 32 to 4371 participants at one to 196 sites. We identified five comparisons. The first comparison of risk-based monitoring versus extensive on-site monitoring found no evidence that the risk-based approach is inferior to extensive on-site monitoring in terms of the proportion of participants with a critical or major monitoring finding not identified by the corresponding method, while resource use was three- to five-fold higher with extensive on-site monitoring. For the second comparison of central statistical monitoring with triggered on-site visits versus regular (untriggered) on-site visits, we found some evidence that central statistical monitoring can identify sites in need of support by an on-site monitoring intervention. In the third comparison, the evaluation of adding an on-site visit to local and central monitoring revealed a high percentage of participants with major or critical monitoring findings in the on-site visit group, but low numbers of absolute monitoring findings in both groups. This means that without on-site visits, some monitoring findings will be missed, but none of the missed findings had any serious impact on patient safety or the validity of the trial's results. In the fourth comparison, two studies assessed new source data verification processes, which are used to check that data recorded within the trial Case Report Form (CRF) match the primary source data (e.g. medical records), and reported little difference to full source data verification processes for the targeted as well as for the remote approach. In the fifth comparison, one study showed no difference in participant recruitment and participant follow-up between a monitoring approach with systematic initiation visits versus an approach with initiation visits upon request by study sites. We are moderately certain that risk-based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on-site monitoring with respect to critical and major monitoring findings in clinical trials. For the remaining body of evidence, there is low or very low certainty in results due to imprecision, small number of studies, or high risk of bias. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more high-quality monitoring studies that measure effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions.
We found a small study suggesting that vision might improve, but severe complications can arise during the process of retinal displacement. Thus, macular translocation might not be considered for most patients with wet AMD given the treatment options already available.
This review was undertaken to examine if single volume (removal of blood equivalent to the blood volume of the baby) is as effective as double volume (removal of twice blood volume of the baby) in reducing the brain damage and bilirubin levels in newborn infants with severe jaundice. Only one randomised trial fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the analysis. This study compared single and double volume exchange transfusion in jaundice due to ABO hemolytic jaundice. The study found no significant difference in bilirubin levels following exchange. This study did not look at any long term neurodevelopmental outcome (brain damage). Based on the available data, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of single volume exchange transfusion as opposed to double volume exchange transfusion in jaundiced newborns.
This review included 95 randomised controlled trials involving 138,164 participants. Seventy-one trials (40,374 participants) were in care facilities, and 24 (97,790 participants) in hospitals. On average, participants were 84 years old in care facilities and 78 years old in hospitals. In care facilities, 75% were women and in hospitals, 52% were women. The majority of trials were at high risk of bias, mostly relating to lack of blinding. With few exceptions, the quality of evidence for individual interventions in either setting was generally rated as low or very low. Risk of fracture and adverse events were generally poorly reported and, where reported, the evidence was very low quality, which means that we are uncertain of the estimates. There was evidence, often from single studies, for a wide range of interventions used for preventing falls in both settings. However, in the following we summarise only the falls outcomes for four key interventions in care facilities and three key interventions in hospitals. We are uncertain of the effect of exercise on the rate of falls (very low-quality evidence) and it may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (low-quality evidence).General medication review may make little or no difference to the rate of falls (low-quality evidence) or the risk of falling (low-quality evidence).Prescription of vitamin D probably reduces the rate of falls (moderate-quality evidence) but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling (moderate-quality evidence). The population included in these studies appeared to have low vitamin D levels.We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls (very low-quality evidence). They may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether physiotherapy aimed specifically at reducing falls in addition to usual rehabilitation in the ward has an effect on the rate of falls or reduces the risk of falling (very low-quality evidence).We are uncertain of the effect of bed alarms on the rate of falls or risk of falling (very low-quality evidence).Multifactorial interventions may reduce the rate of falls, although this is more likely in a rehabilitation or geriatric ward setting (low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of these interventions on risk of falling.
In this case we could find no studies that tested oral nefopam against placebo. It is possible that the studies were performed, but not reported, because they were used only to register nefopam with licensing authorities throughout the world. However, this leaves an important gap in our knowledge, and it means that we cannot be confident, at present, about using oral nefopam for acute painful conditions.
We searched the medical literature to investigate the benefits and harms of thyroid hormone therapy for adults with AKI of any cause who were in hospital and found two studies that involved 97 people. There were many differences between study populations, particularly participants' kidney history (some had their own kidneys; others had transplants); and the drugs that were investigated. These differences meant that we were unable to statistically evaluate (meta-analyse) study data.
We found that risk of death from any cause was much higher among people with AKI who received thyroid hormone therapy compared with those who received placebo in one study; no deaths were reported in the second study. Thyroid hormone therapy was found to be no better or worse than placebo in changing patients' needs for kidney dialysis or transplant. People with AKI who received thyroid hormone therapy needed dialysis for longer than those who received placebo in one study, but no differences in AKI and dialysis durations were noted in the other. Lengths of stay in intensive care units and hospital were similar in both those who received thyroid hormone therapy and placebo in one study; but not reported in the other study. Neither study reported if any participants progressed to end-stage kidney disease. We had planned to analyse changes in kidney function and numbers of dialysis sessions, but data reporting was insufficient to make assessments.
The included studies were few in number, small in size, and low in methodological quality. The available evidence suggested that use of thyroid hormone therapy was associated with worse outcomes in patients with established AKI, and therefore, use of these therapies should be avoided for these people.
We wanted to find out whether taking statins before undergoing cardiac surgery could help reduce the risk of:
– death occurring shortly after surgery; or
– developing other heart or kidney problems.
We also wanted to find out if there were any changes in the quality of care associated with cardiac surgeries for people who had been taking statins, such as reducing the length of hospital stay or intensive care unit stay, or if there were any harmful effects from statin treatment. We searched for studies published up to September 2023 that compared treatment with statins to treatment with a placebo (a pretend medicine that looks or tastes identical to the medicine being tested) or usual care in people undergoing cardiac surgeries. Contrary to previous versions of this review, we only included trials that we were sure were approved by an ethical review board. We found eight studies involving 5592 people with an average age of 63 years and 79% were men. Of these, 2798 people were treated with statins and 2794 people were not treated with statins before cardiac surgery. The smallest study included 57 people and the largest involved 2406 people. All studies were conducted in hospitals affiliated with universities in Asia, Europe and North America. Each study used different statin types (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin or rosuvastatin) and doses (between 20 mg and 80 mg). In people undergoing cardiac surgery, compared to no statin treatment, statin treatment:
– probably results in little to no difference in heart attacks (5 studies, 4645 people), length of intensive care unit stay (3 studies, 4528 people) and overall hospital stay (5 studies, 4788 people);
– may make little to no difference to death within 30 days of surgery (6 studies, 5260 people), irregular heart rhythm (8 studies, 5592 people) and stroke (4 studies, 5143 people).
We are very uncertain about the effects of statins on major harmful cardiac events (1 study, 2406 people) and kidney failure (4 studies, 4728 people). We are moderately confident in our findings that there were probably little to no differences in the risk of heart attack, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. However, we have little to very little confidence about our other findings, namely the most important finding we were looking for, which was a reduction in death. This is because most of the studies had many differences between them, there were fewer comparative cases than expected, and the studies did not always provide information about the statin intervention or treatment outcomes we were interested in. In addition, all studies used a different approach to statin treatment, which made them difficult to compare. Overall, this lowered our confidence in the evidence.
Further studies are required to investigate whether statin treatment can help reduce the likelihood of death and other heart-related (cardiovascular) issues in this context. This is an update of a Cochrane review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.
The search for trials took place in January 2014. This review of 75 randomised controlled trials (13,793 women) found that oral misoprostol appears to be at least as effective as current methods of induction.
Nine trials (1,282 women) showed that oral misoprostol was equivalent to intravenous infusion of oxytocin. There were no obvious differences in the number of women who had a vaginal birth within 24 hours, or the number of women who experienced uterine hyperstimulation with changes to the baby's heart rate, although there were fewer caesarean sections in the group of women who were given oral misoprostol.
For the 37 thirty seven trials (6,417 women) that compared oral and vaginal misoprostol, there was little difference in the number of women who had a vaginal birth within 24 hours, uterine hyperstimulation with changes to the baby's heart rate, or caesarean section.
In 10 trials (3,240 women) comparing oral misoprostol with a vaginal prostaglandin (dinoprost), there was little difference in the frequency of vaginal birth within 24 hours, uterine hyperstimulation with changes to the baby's heart rate, or caesarean section.
The nine trials that compared oral misoprostol with placebo (1,109 women) and found that oral misoprostol is more effective than placebo for inducing labour. Women in the oral misoprostol group were more likely to have vaginal birth within 24 hours, and less likely to have a caesarean section. There was little difference between groups in terms of the number of women who experienced uterine hyperstimulation with changes to the baby's heart rate.
Five trials compared oral misoprostol with intracervical (inserted into the entrance of the womb) prostaglandin E2 (681 women). Oral misoprostol was associated with fewer instances of failure to achieve vaginal birth within 24 hours but more frequent uterine hyperstimulation with changes to the baby's heart rate. The available data for this comparison was limited and the differences in caesarean birth were small.
Overall, the incidence of serious illness or death of the mother or her baby was rare and no meaningful results were available for any of the comparisons in this review.
Using oral misoprostol to induce labour is effective at achieving vaginal birth. It is more effective than placebo, as effective as vaginal misoprostol and vaginal dinoprostone, and results in fewer caesarean sections than using oxytocin alone.
In some countries where misoprostol is not licenced for the purpose of inducing labour, many clinicians may prefer to use some other licensed product such as dinoprostone. Where oral misoprostol is used, evidence suggests that an appropriate dose may be 20 to 25 mcg in solution. Given that safety is the primary concern, the evidence supports the use of oral regimens over vaginal regimens. This is particularly important in settings where the mother is at a higher risk of infection and where there may be insufficient staff to closely monitor the mother and her baby.
We included 15 studies with 1838 participants; 14 included only adults aged 18 years or over. Six studies used a single-dose nasal decongestant and measured the effects on the day it was administered. Nine studies used multiple doses and the effects were measured between one and 10 days after first administration. Eleven studies used tablets or syrup and four studies used nasal sprays. Eight studies were conducted at universities, three at universities in collaboration with hospitals and two in hospitals. The setting was unclear in two studies. Nine studies were funded by drug manufacturers or agencies with commercial interests in the study results. Funding sources were unclear in six studies. We were unable to draw conclusions about single-dose nasal decongestants. We found a small benefit in the relief of nasal congestion from multiple doses, but it was unclear if this was beneficial for patients. No studies reported overall patient well-being. There was no difference in the numbers of adverse events between people who used a nasal decongestant and those who did not. We could not determine if there was a difference in effects between decongestant tablets and nasal sprays. The results relate to adults; there was no evidence on the effectiveness or safety of nasal decongestants for children. We assessed the quality of the evidence for subjective cold symptoms as low for the multi-dose studies - there were few data and reporting was unclear. We also assessed the quality of the evidence for adverse events as low because of unclear reporting and because the estimates were not precise (there were wide confidence intervals - a measure of statistical uncertainty).
In this review we evaluated the efficacy and safety of prophylactic phototherapy in preventing jaundice in preterm or LBW infants. A total of nine clinical trials representing 3449 infants were included. The findings suggest that phototherapy initiated soon after birth (within 36 hours) for preterm or low birth weight infants may prevent the serum bilirubin from reaching a level that would require exchange transfusion and may reduce the risk of impairment of brain and central nervous system development. However, further well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the effects of prophylactic phototherapy on brain and central nervous system development and other long-term outcomes.
This review included 24 studies, conducted with a total of 5802 participants in primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, Spain, Taiwan, and Turkey. The duration of interventions ranged from a single 45-minute session to eight 20-minute sessions on consecutive days. Although a wide range of programmes were used, there were many common elements, including the teaching of safety rules, body ownership, private parts of the body, distinguishing types of touches and types of secrets, and who to tell. Programme delivery formats included film, video or DVD, theatrical plays, and multimedia presentations. Other resources used included songs, puppets, comics, and colouring books. Teaching methods used in delivery included rehearsal, practice, role-play, discussion, and feedback. This review found evidence that school-based sexual abuse prevention programmes were effective in increasing participants' skills in protective behaviours and knowledge of sexual abuse prevention concepts (measured via questionnaires or vignettes). Knowledge gains (measured via questionnaires) were not significantly eroded one to six months after the intervention for either intervention or control groups. In terms of harm, there was no evidence that programmes increased or decreased children's anxiety or fear. No studies measured parental anxiety or fear. Children exposed to a child sexual abuse prevention programme had greater odds of disclosing their abuse than children who had not been exposed, however we were more uncertain about this effect when the analysis was adjusted to account for the grouping of participants in classes or schools. Studies have not yet adequately measured the long-term benefits of programmes in terms of reducing the incidence or prevalence (or both) of child sexual abuse in programme participants. The quality of the evidence for all outcomes included in the meta-analyses (combining of data) was moderate. Study quality was compromised in about half of the included studies, due to suboptimal data collection methods for study outcomes and inappropriate data analysis.
This review of randomised controlled trials showed comparable death and failure rates for oral and intravenous antibiotics for low risk patients, those with solid tumours or chronic leukaemia or lymphoma, and independent of age, source of infection and severity of the neutropenia.
We searched for evidence on (search date 19 September 2016) and identified eight trials (884 women) comparing the types of pushing: spontaneous pushing versus directed pushing with or without epidural analgesia and 13 trials (2879 women) comparing timing of pushing: delayed pushing versus immediate pushing with epidural analgesia. The quality of the evidence in this updated review ranges from moderate to very low quality. For types of pushing (spontaneous pushing versus directed pushing) there was no clear difference in the duration of the second stage (very low-quality evidence ), perineal laceration (low-quality evidence ), episiotomy, time spent pushing (very low-quality evidence ), or number of women with a spontaneous vaginal birth (moderate-quality evidence ) between the women who spontaneously pushed and the women who were directed. Outcomes relating to the baby (such as five-minute Apgar score less than seven (very low-quality evidence ), admission to neonatal intensive care (very low-quality evidence)) were not clearly different. None of the studies reported on the outcome of babies with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. For the timing of pushing: delayed pushing versus immediate pushing (all women with epidural) - delayed pushing was associated with an increase in the duration of the second stage by about 56 minutes (very l ow-quality evidence ). There were no clear differences between the two groups in the number of women with perineal laceration (moderate-quality evidence ) and episiotomy. Delayed pushing reduced the duration of pushing by about 19 minutes (very low-quality of evidence ), and slightly increased the number of women with a spontaneous vaginal birth (moderate-quality evidence ). There were no clear differences between the delayed and immediate pushing groups in terms of important outcomes for the baby: Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (very low-quality evidence ), admission to neonatal intensive care (low-quality evidence). None of the studies reported on the outcome of babies with brain damage due to lack of oxygen to the brain. Futhermore, delayed pushing was associated with an increased incidence of low umbilical cord pH and increased the cost of intrapartum care by CDN$ 68.22. We are unable to say whether spontaneous pushing or directed pushing coaching methods are best. Until further high-quality studies are available, women should be encouraged to push and bear down according to their comfort and preference.
Delaying pushing for women with epidural reduces the time spent pushing when giving birth, and increases the likelihood of a spontaneous vaginal birth. However, it increases the duration of the second stage. The possible effects on important neonatal outcomes and maternal perineal injury (serious tears) is still unclear. Therefore, the evidence is still insufficient and inconclusive to support any indication of specific timing of pushing as well as for the type of pushing once there is no conclusive evidence to indicate an adequate style of pushing to be used in the clinical practice.
Further properly well-designed randomised controlled trials are required to produce more evidence-based information. These trials should address clinically important maternal and neonatal outcomes and will provide more complete data to be incorporated into a future update of this review.
In this review we included seven small trials, involving a total of 153 participants, that examined psychotherapeutic treatments for depression in older people. Five trials compared a form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) against control conditions, and the findings showed that CBT was more effective than control. Two individual trials compared CBT against psychodynamic therapy, with no significant difference in effectiveness indicated between the two approaches. Our review shows that there is relatively little research in this field and care must be taken in generalising what evidence there is to clinical populations.
In February 2014, we did a computer search for studies comparing the no-scalpel approach to the vas with the scalpel method. We included randomized controlled trials in any language. For the initial review, we also looked at reference lists of articles and book chapters.
We found two trials that looked at the no-scalpel approach to the vas. The trials had somewhat different results. The larger trial showed the no-scalpel method led to less bleeding, infection, and pain during and after the procedure. The no-scalpel approach required less time for the operation and had a faster return to sexual activity. The smaller study did not show these differences. However, the study may have been too small and many men dropped out. The two methods did not differ in the numbers of men who became sterile.
We found 53 trials consisting of 1139 participants. Forty-eight studies used a cross-over design, which meant that each person in the trial received two or more treatments－one or more active treatments, the beta-agonist and a placebo in random order. The rest were parallel-group trials, meaning that people received either the active treatment or a placebo. Most of the studies addressed the effect of a giving a single beta2-agonist treatment before exercise and recorded the effect on lung function following exercise. Only eight focused on longer treatment－longer treatments would be needed to assess whether these treatments were harmful over the longer term. Studies in which people received a single administration of a beta-agonist showed that FEV1 (a measure of lung function) fell significantly less for people taking SABA or LABA compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) -17.67%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -19.51% to -15.84%). Other lung function measures confirmed that beta2-agonists were more beneficial compared with placebo. No significant difference in the number of side effects was noted in people taking SABA or LABA compared with people taking placebo. However, it is unlikely that people would be prescribed an inhaler for a single treatment, so we must consider longer-term studies to get a true measure of the side effects that inhalers can cause.
We found that included longer-term studies showed that beta2-agonists were helpful in terms of lung function for the first dose of treatment. However, studies that provided longer-term treatment with SABA or LABA showed that over time, people built up a tolerance to the effects of treatments, and the beneficial effects lasted for shorter periods of time. Overall, we believe that the evidence was of low to moderate quality. This review shows that beta2-agonists－both SABA and LABA－when administered in a single dose, are effective and safe in preventing the symptoms of EIA. Longer-term administration of inhaled beta2-agonists induces tolerance and lacks sufficient safety data. It is important to note that taking LABA without background inhaled steroids is considered unsafe and is not currently recommended in most of the clinical guidelines for asthma. We recommend that more studies are needed to determine whether it is safe to administer inhaled beta2-agonists alone to people who experience asthma symptoms when exercising.
This review is current as of August 2013.
For women diagnosed with breast cancer and found to have 1 to 3 lymph nodes affected by cancer, we asked:
• Does radiotherapy after breast removal reduce the occurrence of region-based recurrence compared to no radiotherapy?
• Is there any survival advantage in women undergoing PMRT compared to those not having radiotherapy?
• What are the short- and long-term unwanted effects of PMRT?
• Is there any difference in the quality of life for women undergoing radiotherapy compared to those with no radiotherapy? We searched for studies that compared radiotherapy after mastectomy against no radiotherapy in women diagnosed with breast cancer with 1 to 3 involved axillary lymph nodes. Once we identified the relevant studies, we compared and summarised the results. We have also assessed and rated our confidence in the presented evidence based on the study methods and the number of women who participated in the studies. We found 3 studies with 725 women; 355 women received radiotherapy, and 370 did not. The largest study was conducted in Denmark and involved 552 women. The remaining two studies were conducted in Sweden and involved 104 premenopausal and 173 postmenopausal women. Only the Danish study administered radiotherapy using methods that are comparable to modern-day practice. All the studies followed the women for 15 years or more. The studies were funded by independent charitable organisations with no funding from private or pharmaceutical companies. The use of radiotherapy compared to no radiotherapy in women diagnosed with breast cancer who have 1 to 3 involved axillary lymph nodes:
• may lead to a reduction in the regional recurrence; and
• probably improves survival by 24% in women.
We did not identify any study that reliably assessed the effect of radiotherapy after mastectomy on disease-free survival, short- or long-term unwanted effects and quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Our confidence in the evidence is low to moderate for 3 main reasons.
First, the studies we included took place before many modern advancements in breast cancer treatment. Second, we could only interpret results from one study that used updated radiotherapy techniques. Finally, the studies we used did not provide all of the information we wanted regarding the long-term effectiveness of treatment in participants. The evidence presented here is up to date to September 2021.
We included five trials with a total of 122 participants. In these trials the length of treatment ranged from two to eight weeks. Four of the trials compared inhaling before to inhaling after the airways had been cleared and found no overall difference in clinical outcomes. However, in children with well-preserved lung function, inhaling of dornase alfa before airway clearance techniques was better for small airways function. However, this did not affect quality of life or other outcomes. In the remaining trial, morning versus evening inhalation had no impact on lung function or symptoms. Therefore, for many people with cystic fibrosis, the timing of dornase alfa inhalation (before or after airway clearance or the time of day) can be based on practical reasons or individual preference. Apart from one trial published only in abstract form, the quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low. This was due to issues relating to group allocation, blinding, incomplete reporting of outcome data and the the limited age range of participants.
We wanted to find out if the McKenzie method is effective for people with (sub)acute NSLBP. We searched for studies that looked at the McKenzie method compared to minimal intervention (e.g. a small booklet with information on spinal pain) (main comparison) or other treatments for (sub)acute NSLBP. We were interested in knowing if the McKenzie method could reduce pain and disability in the short term (closest to two weeks) and in the intermediate term (closest to three months). We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found five studies on a total of 536 people. Two studies compared the McKenzie method to minimal intervention, three compared it to manual therapy, (i.e. hands-on therapy provided by a clinician) and one compared it to other interventions (back massage and advice). All five studies were conducted in high-income countries (three in the USA, one in Australia, and one in Scotland). Three of them were funded by non-commercial sources and two did not provide information on funding sources.
Our main comparison of the McKenzie method versus minimal intervention found that the McKenzie method may result in a slight reduction in pain and disability (0- to 100-point scale, lower scores mean less pain and less disability):
- Pain: improved by 7.30 points (12.04 better to 2.56 better) in the short term (2 trials, 328 participants); and improved by 5.00 points (14.29 better to 4.29 worse) in the intermediate term (1 trial, 180 participants).
- Disability: improved by 2.74 points (7.52 better to 2.04 worse) in the short term (2 trials, 328 participants); and improved by 0.87 points (7.31 better to 5.57 worse) in the intermediate term (1 trial, 180 participants).
Our second comparison of the McKenzie method versus manual therapy found that the McKenzie method may not reduce pain or disability (0- to 100-point scale, lower scores mean less pain and less disability):
- Pain: improved by 8.67 points (27.37 better to 10.02 worse) in the short term (3 trials, 298 participants); and worsened by 7.00 points (0.70 worse to 13.30 worse) in the intermediate term (1 trial, 235 participants).
- Disability: improved by 4.98 points (15.00 better to 5.04 worse) in the short term (3 trials, 298 participants); and worsened by 4.30 points (0.72 better to 9.32 worse) in the intermediate term (1 trial, 235 participants).
Our third comparison of the McKenzie method versus other interventions (back massage and advice) found that the McKenzie method may not reduce disability (0- to 100-point scale, lower scores mean less disability):
- Disability: worsened by 4.00 points (15.44 better to 23.44 worse) in the short term (1 trial, 30 participants); and worsened by 10.0 points (8.95 better to 28.95 worse) in the intermediate term (1 trial, 25 participants).
None of the trials included in the review measured unwanted effects. We are not confident in the evidence because there weren't enough studies, the studies were small, and we have concerns about how some of the studies were conducted. This review included trials published up to 15 August 2022.
This review of trials looked at which type of these medications, oral-form or injection-form, were the best in producing the most successful outcome. The review found no significant benefit of using one type of medication (oral or injectable) over the other, although there were insufficient data from trials. More research is needed to examine this question.
To date, there is no effective treatment for MS, however, a number of studies suggest that exercise interventions aimed to improve daily functioning of patients with MS are effective. Nine randomized controlled trials of exercise therapy for MS patients were included in this review six of which used no therapy as the comparator. There was strong evidence in favor of exercise therapy, compared to no therapy, regarding muscle function and mobility while no evidence was found of improved fatigue, in one study only. No one specifically targeted exercise program was more successful than others. No deleterious effects were described in the included studies.
We included six trials with a combined total of 61,015 patients in this review. Four trials were primary prevention (41,695 patients; HOT, JPAD, JPPP, and TPT) and two were secondary prevention (19,320 patients; CAPRIE and Huynh). Four trials were placebo-controlled (HOT, JPAD, JPPP, and TPT) and two trials included active comparators (CAPRIE and Huynh). CAPRIE 1996 included patients from 16 countries in Europe and USA with recent ischaemic stroke, recent myocardial infarction (MI) or symptomatic peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Mean patients' age was 62.5 years. 72% of the patients were males, and 95% of the patients were Caucasians. HOT 1998 included patients from 26 countries, aged 50 to 80 years (mean 61.5 years) with hypertension. In TPT 1998, men aged between 45 and 69 years (mean 57.5 years) at high risk of ischaemic heart disease were recruited from 108 practices in the UK. Huynh 2001 included patients from Canada with mean age of 67 and with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation MI, with prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and who were poor candidates for a revascularisation procedure. JPAD 2012 included patients from Japan with type 2 diabetes, mean age 65 years and 55% male. JPPP 2019 included Japanese patients with atherosclerotic risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidaemia). Median age was 70 years and 42% of patients were men. Antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), also known as aspirin, for primary prevention in patients with elevated BP did not modify mortality and increased the risk of major bleedings.
Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin probably reduces the risk of non-fatal and all cardiovascular events when compared to clopidogrel. Clopidogrel increases the risk of major bleeding events when compared to aspirin in patients with elevated BP for secondary prevention.
There is no evidence that oral anticoagulation with warfarin modifies mortality in patients with elevated BP for secondary prevention.
Ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and newer antiplatelet agents, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor have not been sufficiently evaluated in patients with elevated BP. Newer antithrombotic oral drugs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) are yet to be tested in patients with high BP. Most evidence in this review is associated with low-certainty evidence. The high risk of bias seemed to be associated with incomplete outcome data and selective reporting in two studies (Huynh and JPPP).
We identified 49 randomised controlled trials (over 140,000 school children) of interventions aiming to prevent children who had never smoked from becoming smokers. At longer than one year, there was a significant effect of the interventions in preventing young people from starting smoking. Programmes that used a social competence approach and those that combined a social competence with a social influence approach were found to be more effective than other programmes. However, at one year or less there was no overall effect, except for programmes which taught young people to be socially competent and to resist social influences.
A smaller group of trials reported on the smoking status of all people in the class, whether or not they smoked at the start of the study. In these trials with follow-up of one year or less there was an overall small but significant effect favouring the controls. This continued after a year; for trials with follow-up longer than one year, those in the intervention groups smoked more than those in the control groups.
When trials at low risk of bias from randomisation, or from losing participants, were examined separately, the conclusions remained the same. Programmes led by adults may be more effective than those led by young people. There is no evidence that delivering extra sessions makes the intervention more effective.
Flupenthixol was first made available in the UK in 1965 and it has been used to treat schizophrenia for nearly five decades. It is available both as a tablet and a long-acting injection. Having been investigated in numerous studies, flupenthixol was found to be effective and well tolerated by people with schizophrenia. The main side effects are shaking, restlessness or the inability to sit still, a dry mouth and some weight gain. Although this drug has been available for decades, few systematic reviews exist on flupenthixol. The effects of this drug in helping people cope with the symptoms of schizophrenia are not currently measured, quantified and known. The review could include only one small study, which was limited and 13 years old. The number as well as the quality of the study was low; for the main outcomes of interest the authors could not rate the quality of evidence at all, as the study did not report on the outcomes of interest for the 'Summary of findings' table. Flupenthixol was compared with chlorpromazine. There was no clear difference in efficacy, nor was there clear information on: increasing their use of services; people’s satisfaction with treatment; quality of life; or costs and cost effectiveness. Flupenthixol is widely available and inexpensive. It is perhaps understandable that it remains one of many drugs used for treating people with serious mental illnesses. This is because the use of flupenthixol is based more on clinical experience, and the decisions of psychiatrists are based on large scale research studies and evidence-based information. The effectiveness and benefits of flupenthixol over chlorpromazine remain largely unknown and incomplete. Large randomised trials could be helpful in increasing knowledge about this drug.

This review has collected information from randomised controlled trials comparing continuous to intermittent nebulised delivery methods in acute asthma attacks. Overall, differences were found between the two methods, with continuous nebulisers producing a modest reduction in admissions compared to intermittent beta-agonist therapy. This finding was especially pronounced in severe acute asthma. Continuous nebuliser therapy may be more effective than intermittent nebulisers for delivering beta-agonist drugs to relieve airway spasm in selected asthma populations.
We took several factors into account when deciding how certain we could be of our results. In this review, two main factors reduced our level of certainty. First, for all the outcomes we looked at, there was only a small number of studies and participants. Second, we thought there was a significant risk that all of the results could have been biased by the way the studies were designed or conducted. For a few outcomes, our confidence was also reduced by inconsistent results between studies. Overall, our certainty about the results ranged from very low to moderate. AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms. Otherwise, no conclusions can yet be drawn on whether AAT is beneficial or safe for people with dementia. The small size of the included studies, and the diversity of outcomes and outcome measures, were major issues. We recommend further well-conducted studies with the inclusion of important outcomes such as emotional and social well-being, quality of life, side effects, and effects on the animals.
We included 12 trials with a total of 3968 participants, of which data from 3750 were available for evaluation of prescribing strategies for people with a variety of respiratory tract infections. Eleven of these studies compared strategies of delaying antibiotics with immediate antibiotics. Five studies compared delayed antibiotics with no antibiotics. Of the 12 studies, six included only children (1569 participants), two included only adults (589 participants), and four included children and adults (1596 participants). The new study included in this update enrolled 448 participants, and 436 were analysed following application of exclusion criteria. Two studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, two studies did not describe the funding sources and the remaining eight studies were funded by state institutions or specialist colleges. Antibiotic use was greatest in the immediate antibiotic group (93%), followed by delayed antibiotics (29%) and no antibiotics (13%).
Patient satisfaction was similar for people who trialled delayed antibiotics (88% satisfied) compared to immediate antibiotics (90% satisfied), but was greater than no antibiotics (86% versus 81% satisfied).
There were no differences between immediate , delayed and no antibiotics for many symptoms including fever, pain, feeling unwell, cough and runny nose. The only differences were small and favoured immediate antibiotics for relieving pain, fever and runny nose for sore throat; and pain and feeling unwell for middle ear infections. Compared to no antibiotics, delayed antibiotics led to a small reduction in how long pain, fever and cough persisted in people with colds. There was little difference in antibiotic adverse effects, and no significant difference in complications.
In the first month after the initial consultation, two studies indicated that participants were no more likely to come back and see the doctor in either the delayed or immediate prescribing groups. Excluding the first month, one study found that participants were no more likely to return to see the doctor in the 12 months after the delayed or immediate prescription for another respiratory infection, and another study found that participants were more likely to come back and see the doctor in the next 12 months if they had had an immediate prescription compared to a delayed prescription.
Two studies including children with acute otitis media reported on the use of other medicines in the delayed and immediate antibiotic groups. There was no difference in the use of ibuprofen, paracetamol and otic drops in one study. In the other study, fewer spoons of paracetamol were used in the immediate antibiotic group compared with the delayed antibiotic group on the second and third day after the child's initial presentation. No included studies evaluated herbal or other forms of complementary medicine.
No included studies evaluated antibiotic resistance. Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns that people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.
When doctors feel it is safe not to immediately prescribe antibiotics, advising no antibiotics but to return if symptoms do not resolve, rather than delayed antibiotics, will result in lower antibiotic use but may result in lower patient satisfaction. Using a delayed antibiotic strategy will still result in a significant reduction in antibiotic use compared to the use of immediate antibiotics.
Some studies have suggested that resecting the primary cancer can prolong survival and prevent complication arising from the cancer, such as obstruction or bleeding. This review addresses the question of whether surgically removing the primary cancer is beneficial to patients with advanced and unresectable colorectal cancer. No randomised controlled trials were identified.
The researchers searched the medical literature up to 23 August 2018. Four published studies, including a total of 188 people, examined antidepressant therapy in people with IBD. The age of participants ranged from 27 to 37.8 years. In three studies participants had IBD in remission and in one study participants had either active IBD or IBD in remission. Participants in one study had co-existing anxiety or depression. One study used duloxetine (60 mg daily), one study used fluoxetine (20 mg daily), one study used tianeptine (36 mg daily), and one study used various antidepressants. Three studies had a placebo (e.g. sugar pill) control group and one study had a no treatment control group.
The analysis showed that the symptoms of anxiety and depression were improved in those who took antidepressants compared to placebo. Participants who received antidepressants experienced more side effects than those who received placebo. Side effects reported by those taking antidepressants included: nausea, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual problems, insomnia, fatigue, low mood/anxiety, dry mouth, poor sleep, restless legs and hot flushes. Some aspects of quality of life were improved as was IBD activity in the antidepressant group. The overall quality of the studies included in this review was poor because the studies included small numbers of participants, and involved IBD populations which differed from each other on key characteristics. In addition, different types of antidepressants were assessed so the evidence for any one antidepressant was uncertain. Therefore, future studies are needed to confirm these observations. The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain and no firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of antidepressants in IBD can be drawn. More studies are needed to allow for firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of the use of antidepressants in people with IBD.
We found 3 studies involving 2396 women. (We included studies up to March 2015.) The quality of the studies and therefore the strength of the evidence was mainly low. In the short term, births with a planned caesarean were safer for babies than vaginal births. Fewer babies died or were seriously hurt when they were born by caesarean. However, children who were born by caesarean had more health problems at age two, though the numbers were too small to be certain. Caesareans caused some short-term problems for mothers such as more abdominal pain. They also had some benefits, such as less urinary incontinence and less perineal pain in one study. The studies did not look at effects on future pregnancies, when having had a previous caesarean may cause complications. The studies only looked at single births (not twins or triplets) and did not study premature babies. If your baby is in the breech position, it may be safer to have a planned caesarean section. However, caesareans may not be so good for the mother and may make future births less safe. We also do not yet know the effects of caesarean birth on babies’ health when they are older.
We performed a thorough literature search for studies reporting the use of IL-6 levels for detection of sepsis up to January 2019. We found 23 studies enrolling 4192 severely ill adults. Our assessment of the evidence reveals the complexity of the research topic, represented in the high variability of information reported by the studies. We found the characteristics of assessed patients to vary considerably between studies in terms of age, gender, setting, initial diagnosis, indicative value for sepsis, and source of infection, among other factors. This variability in the collected data prevented a formal numerical synthesis of the findings. Using the available data to perform an approximated estimation of the consequences, we found that 700 out of 1000 patients under suspicion of sepsis might be correctly classified, but 130 out of 1000 patients would be wrongly considered as having sepsis, while 170 out of 1000 patients might be incorrectly considered as not having sepsis. These errors would result in a serious increase in the risk of further morbidity and death due to delays of adequate treatment. This information should be interpreted with caution due to limitations in the collected data. We judged the included studies to have important limitations in their validity, hence they are at high risk of providing distorted results (i.e. to be at high risk of bias).
In the current review, we looked at women with endometriosis, who were treated with GnRHas, and compared this treatment with other forms of hormonal treatment.
We wanted to find out if GnRHas were better than any other hormonal treatment to improve pain and to see their effect on bone mineral density.
Additionally, we wanted to find out if GnRHas were associated with an improved quality of life and also unveil any unwanted effects. The review involved searching for studies that investigated the effect of GnRHas compared with placebo (dummy treatment) and other hormonal treatment in women with endometriosis. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 72 trials that involved 7355 women with endometriosis.
- A difference in overall pain, reported as pain reduction was seen in favour of GnRHas compared to placebo. We also saw that women treated with GnRHas had less pelvic pain reduction and an increase in endometriotic lesions after six months of treatment, compared to danazol.
- After six months of treatment, there was a greater decrease of pain for women treated with GnRHas compared to gestrinone.
- No difference was seen in pain scores between women treated with GnRHas compared to other hormonal treatment options.
- Most adverse effects were seen in women treated with GnRHas compared to placebo (hot flushes), with danazol (weight gain) and gestrinone (hot flushes).
- A greater decrease in bone mineral density was found in GnRHas compared to gestrinone and GnRHas in conjunction with calcium-regulating agents.
- For the other comparisons examined in the current review, we are uncertain of the effect between the examined groups. It should be noted, however, that the evidence was often of (very) low quality in the analyses undertaken for the other comparisons. The included studies were of low quality mainly due to poor reporting of study methods and the inaccuracy with which the results were reported. The evidence is up-to-date to May 2022.
The findings of this review indicate that professional advice and guidance with continued support can encourage people to be more physically active in the short to mid-term. More research is needed to establish which methods of exercise promotion work best in the long-term to encourage specific groups of people to be more physically active.
Our search to April 2019 found six studies, including 1,073 older adults in total. People in the studies had an average age of 58 to 82 years. In three of the studies, the dose of the antihypertensive was slowly lowered before stopping. We found that stopping antihypertensive medications is possible in older adults. Most of the older people in the discontinuation groups did not need to restart their medication.
We found low certainty of evidence that stopping antihypertensive medication increased blood pressure by a small amount.
We found low or very low certainty of evidence that stopping blood pressure medications did not increase the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, hospitalisation or death.
We found very low certainty of evidence that stopping blood pressure medications did not increase the risk of adverse events and may resolve side effects, but this was not reported well, and so we were unable to draw conclusions.
None of the studies reported whether stopping blood pressure medications affected falls. inty of the evidence
We rated the certainty of the evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. High certainty evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Very low certainty evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. We judged the certainty of evidence as very low and low. It may be safe to stop antihypertensive medications in older people who are taking the medication for high blood pressure or primary prevention of heart disease.
Older adults should not stop any of their medications without talking to a healthcare professional.
Future studies should include older adults who are taking multiple other medications and/or living with frailty.
The evidence is up to date to March 2019.
We include 30 studies, describing 18,682 participants after treatment for childhood cancer. We found a lot of variation between studies in cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, age of participants, the questionnaires used to assess fatigue, and the size of the study. Eighteen studies reported a prevalence of severe fatigue, which ranged from 0% to 61.7%. Four studies reported a prevalence of severe fatigue in the patient's brothers and sisters or in population-based controls. Prevalence rates in these control groups ranged from 3.1% to 10.3%. In these four studies, survivors were more often fatigued than controls. This difference was only significant in two studies.
When we looked at the prevalence of severe fatigue in survivors of lymphoma and leukaemia (types of blood cancers), we found that they ranged from 1.8% to 35.9%. Two studies reported on severe fatigue in brain cancer survivors, with rates of 21.13% and 14.6%. One study in bone cancer survivors reported no cases of severe fatigue. For survivors aged 18 and younger, prevalence rates ranged from 6.7% to 12.5%. By contrast, in studies including participants aged 16 years and over (but mostly over 18), prevalence rates ranged from 4.4% to 61.7%.
Twenty-two studies assessed one or more possible risk factors for fatigue. Our review shows that depression might increase fatigue. The age at cancer diagnosis and the education level of the survivor did not seem to influence fatigue.
Only one study provided information about the course of fatigue over time, and found that over the course of 2.7 years 32 of the 102 participants (31.4%) reported persistent severe fatigue. All included studies had problems with the quality of the evidence, and we found many differences between studies for several characteristics. The evidence to address our review question is therefore weak. The occurrence of severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer remains uncertain. This is also the case for the course of severe fatigue after completion of cancer treatment and the risk factors that might be responsible for developing fatigue.
Our review included 11 clinical trials that randomized 1838 participants (current until December 2015). The trials included thigh and leg arteries above and below the knee. The trials were carried out in Europe and the USA, and all used DEBs that contained paclitaxel. Four companies manufactured the DEB devices: Bard, Bavaria Medizin, Biotronik, and Medtronic. Most participants were followed for 12 or more months (called follow-up). At six and 12 months of follow-up, DEBs were associated with improved primary vessel patency, which is an indicator of whether a vessel is still patent without any further interventions (blood flowing well), late lumen loss, which is the difference in millimeters between the angioplastied segment and how narrow it is on follow-up, target lesion revascularization, which is an indicator of whether a person received more than one treatment to the same artery during the period covered by the study, and binary restenosis, which occurs when a treated artery becomes narrowed again after being previously treated.
Unfortunately, early anatomic (structural) advantages of DEBs were not accompanied by improvements in quality of life, functional walking ability, or in the occurrence of amputation or death. When we specifically examined arteries below the knee and people who had very advanced PAD, we found no clinical or angiographic advantage for DEBs at 12 months of follow-up compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty. In summary, DEBs have several anatomic advantages over uncoated balloons for the treatment of lower limb PAD for up to 12 months after undergoing the procedure. However, more data are needed to assess the long-term results of this treatment option adequately. All the trials had differences in the way in which they inserted the balloons, and in the type and duration of additional antiplatelet (anticlotting) therapy, leading to downgrading of the quality of the evidence. The quality of the evidence presented was moderate for target lesion revascularization and change in Rutherford category (a way of classifying PAD), and high for amputation, primary vessel patency, binary restenosis, death, and change in ankle-brachial index (which is used to predict the severity of PAD).
Evidence is current to November 2014. We included studies in children (aged older than 28 days and younger than 18 years) and adult patients (aged 18 years or older) of either gender undergoing surgery on digits (fingers and toes) under nerve blocks using adrenaline with lidocaine. We found four eligible studies with 167 participants.
One small study reported the duration of anaesthesia and found that adrenaline prolonged the duration of anaesthesia, but the quality of the evidence was low.
No study reported on adverse events such as ischaemia distal to the injection site or cost analysis with use of adrenaline with lidocaine.
Duration of postoperative pain relief was reported by one study, but available data were insufficient for analysis of the findings.
Two studies reported reduced bleeding during surgery with use of adrenaline with lidocaine. In the light of our results, we would expect that 17.2 out of 100 patients who received adrenaline with lidocaine (between 8.7 and 29.8 patients) would have bleeding during surgery compared with 49 patients who would have received plain lidocaine; however, the quality of the evidence was low, and further research is very likely to impact our confidence in this estimate. The quality of evidence is low for both duration of anaesthesia and bleeding during surgery with use of adrenaline with lidocaine. Further research is needed to prove the benefits of adding adrenaline to lidocaine.
We searched for evidence in the literature until June 2018 and identified a total of 16 studies. Studies were included if a routine calcitonin test (with or without the stimulation test) was performed in all included people with thyroid nodular disease. In total 72,638 people with thyroid nodular disease were enrolled in the analysed studies, of which 187 had medullary thyroid carcinoma. Our findings indicate that both basal and stimulated calcitonin testing are able to detect nearly all people with medullary thyroid carcinoma. However, because medullary thyroid carcinoma is very rare in persons with a thyroid nodule, there is large chance that calcitonin levels are false positives (i.e. the test indicates the disease, whereas in fact there is none).
In practice this means that for every 10,000 persons with thyroid nodular disease, 23 persons will have medullary thyroid carcinoma. Of these, none will be missed using a basal calcitonin threshold of 10 pg/mL, while 280 people will have a false-positive test result. This might lead to unnecessary surgery of the thyroid with the need for life-long thyroid hormone supplementation and risk of complications. With the use of a stimulation test the chance of a false-positive test result may be reduced, however due to lack of sufficient studies this could not be calculated. The certainty of the evidence is importantly limited, because almost all studies did not report adequately on the outcome of people who had a negative calcitonin test. A number of patients who had medullary thyroid carcinoma were possibly not identified. The diagnostic accuracy can already be markedly affected when a small number of patients is missed because medullary thyroid carcinoma is very rare. Based on the available literature, there is insufficient evidence for a routine calcitonin test in all people with a thyroid nodule. Further studies are needed, with also adequate reporting of the people who have a negative calcitonin test, to determine the role of the calcitonin test in people with thyroid nodules for detection of medullary thyroid carcinoma.
The evidence is current to December 2014. We included 18 studies. Eleven are complete, and seven are ongoing. In the completed studies, 1392 people with coronary heart disease were recruited. The average age of participants ranged from 54.9 to 66.27 years. The majority of people recruited were men. Studies were carried out worldwide, and in a variety of healthcare settings. Seven studies tested broad programmes targeting multiple lifestyle factors related to heart disease. Four studies tested programmes focused only on increasing levels of physical activity. The length of the programmes in the included studies ranged from six weeks to one year. These programmes were compared to no intervention in six studies, some support in three studies, and full traditional rehabilitation in two studies. There is no evidence to date to suggest that Internet-delivered programmes help reduce rates of death or future cardiac surgery, but this was based on a small number of studies. There is also no strong evidence to date suggesting a benefit of these programmes for lipid levels or blood pressure. There is some evidence to suggest improvements in HRQOL and behaviour change, but there is insufficient evidence to date to draw firm conclusions. Studies have not yet measured the impact of Internet-delivered programmes on medication compliance. There was very limited information on healthcare utilisation and cost of interventions. The reporting of the seven ongoing studies will add to the evidence base. The evidence was generally of low quality. The included studies were at some risk of bias, with six studies judged at high risk of bias for some risk of bias domains. The results of this review therefore need to be interpreted cautiously.
There is currently limited evidence on the effects of Internet-based interventions for the treatment of coronary heart disease. We identified seven ongoing trials, which we will incorporate into this review when the results are available.
This is an update of previous reviews. We searched for studies published up to April 2018, and found three new studies that we could include, giving a total of 14 studies with 3370 participants. Studies had to be randomised controlled trials that recruited smokers trying to quit, and measured whether participants had quit smoking at least six months after the beginning of the study. The study had to include at least one group who were part of a stop-smoking programme to increase partner support, and at least one group who received a comparable stop-smoking programme without partner support. Most of the studies were conducted in the USA. At recruitment the average amount participants smoked was between 13 to 29 cigarettes a day across studies. The smoking status of partners providing support varied, but most were non-smokers. Intervention techniques ranged from low to high intensity; in some cases help was by a self-help booklet and in other cases by face-to-face counselling. In some studies researchers did not make direct contact with 'partners' and the smokers themselves were encouraged to find a 'buddy', but in other studies both the smoker and their 'buddy' received face-to-face support. We combined 12 studies (2818 participants) to measure successful quitting at six to nine months follow-up, and seven studies (2573 participants) to measure quitting at 12-month follow-up. Partner support did not increase the chances of stopping smoking at either time point. We also split the studies in each analysis based on the type of partner giving support (relatives/friends/co-workers versus spouses/cohabiting partners versus fellow cessation-programme participants). There was no difference in quit rates between study groups, regardless of the type of partner providing the support. Only one study reported that partner support improved more in the group given the partner-support intervention than in the group where no partner-support intervention was provided. Another study reported that partner support improved more in a more intensive partner-support intervention than a less intensive partner-support intervention. We rated the overall quality of the evidence as low. This is because there were problems with the design of some of the studies. A number of important studies only used participant self-report to measure if people had quit smoking, and there is a chance that these reports may have been inaccurate. Also, very few studies found that the intervention actually increased the level of partner support that participants received. This review therefore cannot tell us whether receiving more support from a partner can help a person to give up smoking.
We included 16 double-blind, randomised controlled trials, with 3972 adults (search up to 9 November 2020). Participants taking cilostazol for three to six months could walk approximately 26 metres further before calf pain and 40 metres further in total compared to participants taking placebo. However, participants taking cilostazol had nearly three times the odds of experiencing headache related to study medication. There is currently not enough information about the effectiveness of cilostazol for serious events such as amputation, revascularisation and cardiovascular events. Despite its importance, only four studies reported quality of life, using different tools and ways of reporting. Very limited data indicated no difference between cilostazol and pentoxifylline for improving walking distance, and there was not enough information comparing cilostazol with pentoxifylline, for any other outcomes. We judged the evidence to be 'very low' to 'low-certainty' for all outcomes except headaches, which were 'moderate-certainty'. All studies were downgraded because we strongly suspected publication bias from drug company involvement. Cilostazol can increase the distance walked both in total and before the onset of pain, compared to placebo. Cilostazol was associated with increased headaches and there was a lack of evidence for other important outcomes such as amputation, revascularisation and cardiovascular events.
For this updated review, we identified five new studies (606 participants), bringing the total number of studies to 12, involving 2171 participants with COPD. The average age of participants was 66 years, 67% were male and participants had received a diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. Eleven studies compared an injectable vaccine versus a control, and one study compared two different types of injectable vaccine. People who were vaccinated were less likely to experience an episode of community-acquired pneumonia; 19 people with COPD (95% confidence interval (CI) 13 to 52) would have to be vaccinated to prevent one episode of pneumonia. Vaccination made no difference in the risk of pneumococcal pneumonia due to S pneumoniae or in the chance of dying or of being admitted to hospital. People who were vaccinated were less likely to experience a COPD exacerbation; eight people with COPD (95% CI 5 to 58) would have to be vaccinated to prevent one person from having an acute exacerbation. We found no difference in effectiveness between the two types of injectable vaccine. Evidence in this review is generally independent and reliable, and we are moderately certain about the results. In line with current guidance, this review suggests that all people with COPD should be given pneumococcal vaccination to provide some protection against community-acquired pneumonia, and to reduce the chance of an acute exacerbation.
This review of three randomised controlled trials involving 3400 women in the USA found that there was no reduction in the number of preterm births in women attending specialised antenatal clinics. The results were difficult to interpret, as the trials were conducted in slightly different ways and offered slightly different care. The trials were all conducted in the 1980s, before the introduction of many of the screening tests currently offered in specialised antenatal clinics such as ultrasound assessment of cervical length. There was no information available on the effect of specialised antenatal care on maternal wellbeing or long-term outcome.
We searched scientific databases and found four randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) including 579 adults, which met our inclusion criteria. This review includes evidence identified up to April 2015. All-cause mortality (death from any cause) was no different in people who received the ILR. Loop recorders do not seem to change quality of life, although people with ILR had a significantly higher rate of diagnosis compared to participants in the standard assessment group. Moreover, data seem to show a trend towards a reduction in syncope recurrences after diagnosis in people implanted with ILR. Finally, costs were higher in the group of participants in which the ILR was implanted but the cost per diagnosis and the cost to diagnose an arrhythmia were much lower for participants randomised to ILR implant. There was low quality evidence that ILR does not change mortality if compared to a standard diagnostic assessment of people with syncope. There was moderate quality evidence that ILR increases the rate of diagnosis if compared to a standard diagnostic assessment. Future research is needed in order to clarify if ILRs can improve quality of life and reduce syncope recurrences and costs.
All the included studies were funded: two of them by scientific societies, the remaining were partially supported by the ILR's manufacturers.
This systematic review showed that this drug does not increase the number of remissions but increases the number of patients that withdrew from the included studies due to side effects. The methodological quality of the included studies was high. Further studies of this agent for the treatment of active Crohn's disease are unlikely to be undertaken.
We searched the databases to 8 December 2014. We found seven randomized controlled trials (from 1992 to 2014) with 571 participants that met our inclusion criteria. Two of the seven trials involved 36 participants undergoing non-cardiac vascular surgery (infrarenal aortic surgery), and five involved 535 participants undergoing cardiac surgery, including valvular surgery, coronary artery bypass surgery, and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The interventions started from 11 days to 25 minutes before surgery in six trials and during surgery in one. All of the seven studies were conducted in Europe and the United States. One of the seven studies was funded by a drug company. Three trials involving 419 participants reported on deaths, but the results were imprecise with no evidence of a difference between the intervention and placebo groups (perioperative mortality). Two trials with 345 participants reported a similar number of participants in the two groups with changes in their electrocardiogram that indicated a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction). The output of the heart (cardiac index) appeared to be increased in one trial only.
The two trials that reported the risk of low blood pressure as a potential complication of the intervention found no apparent difference; and the risk of stroke was similar with and without the intervention in three trials.
The results from three studies showed that ACEIs or ARBs may reduce length of hospital stay, but these findings should be interpreted cautiously because of the possible influence of the clinical backgrounds of the participants studied. Two trials that assessed adverse events found no evidence of a difference between ACEIs or ARBs and placebo (no treatment). The quality of evidence for the outcomes was low or very low. The overall number of participants was small. Most participants were undergoing cardiac surgery, which meant the findings cannot be generalized to other types of surgery. We reran the search on February 3, 2017. We will deal with the three studies of interest when we update the review.
Studies have claimed the beneficial role of biliary decompression, which can be performed via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) with stent insertion pre-surgically. The review found that pre-surgical biliary stenting via ERCP did not improve the morbidity and mortality in patients with pancreatico-biliary malignancy. Further evidence about its efficiency is needed.
We investigated the consequences of giving transfusions of:
- blood stored for a shorter duration versus blood stored for a longer duration, and
- blood stored for a shorter duration versus blood stored for a standard length of time ('standard practice storage duration'; this period varies between hospitals)
to anyone needing a blood transfusion.
We searched the medical literature to 20 November 2017. We identified 22 studies, which included a range of 42,835 participants (newborn babies less than 4 weeks old (neonates), children, and adults). Eleven studies (2249 participants) compared transfusion of blood stored for a shorter duration versus transfusion of blood stored for a longer duration, and the other 11 studies (40,588 participants) compared transfusion of blood stored for a shorter duration versus transfusion of standard practice storage duration blood. We assessed the quality of evidence for our results, which ranged from very low to moderate quality. These judgements are based on the number of trials and participants contributing data to each result, how similar the results were between trials, and the reliability of the trial methods used. Future research is highly likely to change the findings of results judged to be of very low quality, but is less likely to change the findings of other results, such as risk of death, for which we rated the evidence as moderate. Transfusion of blood stored for a shorter duration versus blood stored for a longer duration
Eight studies focused on adults, two on children with severe anaemia (low blood count) and two on low birth weight neonates. In adults undergoing major surgery, transfusion of blood stored for a shorter duration versus blood stored for a longer duration probably leads to little or no difference in risk of death up to 30 days but the quality of evidence is moderate. In children we were uncertain whether transfusion of blood stored for a shorter duration increases or decreases risk of death, because the quality of the evidence is very low. Eight studies focused on adults, most of whom were in hospital. Three studies enrolled critically ill neonates. Transfusion of blood of shorter storage duration versus blood of standard practice storage duration probably leads to little or no difference in risk of death in adults in the 30 days after transfusion. Whether transfusion of blood of shorter storage duration increases or decreases risk of death in critically ill neonates up to 30 days after transfusion is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low.
Two studies in critically ill adults provided information on adverse reactions to transfusion, but had conflicting results. While one study found more transfusions associated with fever in the participants who received blood stored for a shorter duration than those who received standard practice storage duration blood, another study found no differences between the two groups. We observed no clear difference in the risk of death at different time points between transfusion of blood stored for a shorter duration versus blood stored for a longer duration or versus blood stored for the standard practice storage duration.
We wanted to find out which treatment led to the most improvement in symptoms, the least recurrence of the disease and fewer side effects/complications. We searched for studies that compared one treatment option for cystic echinococcosis (oral medication, surgery, percutaneous techniques) with a different treatment option for people with liver cystic echinococcosis at different active stages. We included three studies. One study of 38 adults and children aged 5 to 72 years in Turkey compared different percutaneous treatments plus albendazole (standard catheterization plus PAIR), and two studies with 142 adults and children aged 6 to 60 years from India and Pakistan compared laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole to open surgery plus albendazole. We found no data on symptom improvement or on whether more cysts became inactive at 12 months after treatment.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of standard catheterization plus albendazole on cyst recurrence, deaths and secondary echinococcosis compared to PAIR plus albendazole. Standard catheterization plus albendazole may increase major complications and may make little to no difference on minor complications, but the evidence is very uncertain. Standard catheterization plus albendazole may increase duration of hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain.
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole on cyst recurrence, death and major complications compared to open surgery plus albendazole. Laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole may lead to slightly fewer minor complications and may reduce the duration of hospital stay compared to open surgery plus albendazole. We are not confident in the evidence because we included only three studies with a small number of participants. The studies did not report all the treatments that we were interested in, and they did not report results on the outcome measures that we were interested in, such as symptom improvement. All results applied to specific cyst stages. The evidence is up to date to 4 May 2023.
The authors of this review evaluated the efficacy and safety of preoperative physical therapy with an exercise component in cardiac surgery patients. From the pertinent literature, eight studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 856 participants. The results showed that preoperative physical therapy reduced the number of patients who experienced atelectasis or pneumonia but not the number of patients who experienced pneumothorax, prolonged ventilation or postoperative death. Patients who had preoperative physical therapy had an earlier (on average by more than three days) discharge from the hospital. Information on adverse events was limited but those studies that did report on adverse events reported none. None of the studies reported on the costs of preoperative physical therapy.
The authors concluded that preoperative physical therapy, especially inspiratory muscle training, prevents some postoperative complications including atelectasis, pneumonia, and length of hospital stay.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregularity of the heartbeat that leads to blood clots forming in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). These clots can break free and travel through the bloodstream to the brain and cause a stroke. Drugs that slow clotting, such as oral anticoagulants (warfarin and other coumarin derivates) and antiplatelet agents (aspirin and others), reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. In this review of eight randomized trials, including 9598 patients, oral anticoagulants are shown to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular AF and with no prior stroke or transient ischemic attack by one-third when compared with antiplatelet agents alone. Antiplatelet agents reduce stroke by about 20% in AF patients compared with no therapy, offering a less efficacious therapeutic option for those deemed not eligible for anticoagulation therapy. The threshold of absolute benefit that warrants anticoagulation remains controversial and depends on patient's preferences and availability of optimal anticoagulation monitoring.
We included 31 studies conducted in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Participants were skilled birth attendants including doctors, midwives, nurses, auxiliary nurses and their managers.
Our synthesis pointed to several factors that affected skilled birth attendants’ provision of quality care. The following factors are based on evidence assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Skilled birth attendants reported that they sometimes had insufficient training during their education or after they had begun work. Where facilities lacked staff, skilled birth attendants’ workloads could increase, it could become difficult to provide supervision, and mothers could receive poorer care. In addition, skilled birth attendants did not always believe that their salaries and benefits reflected their tasks and responsibilities and the personal risks they undertook. Together with poor living and working conditions, these issues could lead to stress and affect skilled birth attendants' family life. Some skilled birth attendants felt that managers lacked capacity and skills, and they felt unsupported when their workplace concerns were not addressed.
Possible causes of staff shortages included problems with hiring and assigning health workers to health facilities; lack of funding; poor management and bureaucratic systems; and low salaries. Skilled birth attendants and their managers suggested factors that could help recruit, keep, and motivate health workers, and improve the quality of their work; these included good-quality housing, allowances for extra work, paid vacations, continued education, proper assessments of their work, and rewards.
Skilled birth attendants’ ability to provide quality care was also limited by a lack of equipment, drugs, and supplies; blood and the infrastructure to manage blood transfusions; electricity and water supplies; and adequate space and amenities on maternity wards. These factors were seen to reduce skilled birth attendants’ morale, increase their workload and infection risk, and make them less efficient in their work. A lack of transport sometimes made it difficult for skilled birth attendants to refer women to higher levels of care. In addition, women’s negative perceptions of the health system could make them reluctant to accept referral.
We identified some other factors that also may have affected the quality of care, which were based on findings assessed as of low or very low confidence. Poor teamwork and lack of trust and collaboration between health workers appeared to negatively influence care. In contrast, good collaboration and teamwork appeared to increase skilled birth attendants’ motivation, their decision-making abilities, and the quality of care. Skilled birth attendants’ workloads and staff shortages influenced their interactions with mothers. In addition, poor communication undermined trust between skilled birth attendants and mothers. We searched for studies published before November 2016.
The review was updated in 2015 and includes 12 studies with 5723 people who received risperidone depot or a range of other treatments (placebo, general oral antipsychotics, oral risperidone, oral quetiapine, oral aripiprazole, oral olanzapine, atypical/newer depot antipsychotics, older depot antipsychotics). It is difficult to know from the results of this review if depot risperidone is any more effective in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia than placebo or other treatments. For people who are happy to take oral medication, depot risperidone is about equal to oral risperidone. People on oral risperidone may continue to benefit if treated with depot risperidone, without the need to take tablets. However, in high doses, depot risperidone can have serious side effects, particularly movement disorders, uncontrollable shaking, spasms and tremors. Depot risperidone may bring this new antipsychotic to people who stop taking their tablets, so helping reduce relapse and with little increased risk of side effects. The quality of evidence presented is, in the main, low and at best moderate. There is the need for large, long-term and well reported trials on depot risperidone for people with schizophrenia. Depot injections are often used on people who refuse treatment. Such people are difficult to include in studies.

This review searched for high-quality research studies to try to determine how effective sending test results via email to patients or caregivers is, and what the outcomes are for patients/caregivers, healthcare professionals and health services. We found no studies that looked at the effects of using email for sending test results to patients, and so cannot present any results. We recommend that high-quality research is carried out to examine the use of email for this purpose.
This review has merged studies from two previous reviews. One of the reviews was of competitions and incentives for quitting smoking. The studies that investigated incentives are now in a separate review. Here we include the studies which investigated competitions, alongside the studies originally included in our review of Quit & Win contests. We also searched for more recent relevant studies that were published up to June 2018. We include 20 studies of more than 11,000 participants that investigated competitions to encourage people to quit smoking. In five of these studies, groups of smokers recruited from workplaces competed directly against each other. In the other 15 studies, successful quitters were entered into prize draws. None of the studies in which groups of smokers competed against each other directly found that more people quit than in similar groups of smokers who were not entered into a competition. Combining the results of randomized controlled trials of lottery-type competitions, which provide the best evidence, did not show evidence that competitions increase rates of quitting smoking. Three Quit & Win contests did find that people who were in the contest had higher quit rates than people in a comparison community, who did not take part. However, these studies were of low quality and appeared to have very little effect on the overall smoking rates in the community, as fewer than one in 500 smokers appeared to quit because of the Quit & Win contest.
Fourteen of the 20 studies included were randomized controlled trials, but many of these did not describe their methods well enough for us to decide whether they were of high quality. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence included in this review to be very low, so we can draw no strong conclusions from the findings. It is important that any future research in this area is designed to be of high quality and is reported in detail, so that we can increase the confidence we have in our findings.
This review assessed if knowing the cervical length can prevent preterm birth. We included seven randomised controlled studies, which involved 923 pregnant women at 14 to 32 weeks' gestation. One study included expectant mothers with twins, without any symptoms of preterm birth or labour, and looked at the number of babies born prematurely before 36 weeks. Four studies included expectant mothers of single babies with threatened preterm labour, and one study involving women with premature rupture of the membranes looked at the safety of transvaginal ultrasound. One trial included expectant mothers with singleton pregnancies who did not have any symptoms of preterm birth or labour to look at the efficacy of transvaginal ultrasound cervical length screening. All studies used transvaginal ultrasound to assess cervical length.
For women with twin pregnancies and not showing symptoms of preterm birth, we are unclear of the impact of knowing the cervical length on whether babies are born before 34 weeks' gestation, or their gestational age at birth (1 study, 125 women), because we assessed the quality of the evidence to be very low. For women with a single baby and threatened preterm labour, knowledge of their cervical length may have led to a longer pregnancy by about four days (4 studies, 410 women), but the evidence on the number of babies born before 37 weeks was unclear (2 studies, 242 women). For women whose waters had broken, it is unclear whether healthcare provider knowledge makes any difference to whether the women gave birth preterm, or on the number of infections, again because we judged the quality of evidence as very low. For women with singleton pregnancies not showing symptoms of preterm birth, it is unclear whether an ultrasound to measure cervical length made any difference to whether their babies were born before 37 weeks' gestation (1 study, 296 women; very low-quality evidence). We found a limited number of studies including small numbers of women. The studies varied in their design and had a broad spread of results. Women were not blinded to whether they had an ultrasound or not. Currently, there is not enough high quality research to show if knowledge of cervical length in women with twin or singleton pregnancies has any effect. Future studies could include ways of managing women as a result of the cervical length results, and it would be useful to look at specific populations separately, such as single babies versus twins and women with and without symptoms of preterm labour. They could also report on all important maternal and perinatal outcomes, and include cost-effectiveness analyses.
The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 7 April 2016. It included only one study in which 32 children were randomised to receive an oral appliance or no treatment. Twenty-three participants finished the study. Treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in children appears to be possible with oral appliances or functional orthopaedic appliances. However, this is only based on data from one small study. This was a study with a small number of participants and the quality of the evidence for the different outcomes was rated as very low. At present there is insufficient evidence to conclude that oral or functional orthopaedic appliances are effective in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in children.
In many countries in the industrialised world there has been a huge growth in the prescription of medication for people with mental health problems, taken orally as a tablet or by injection. Atypical and second generation antipsychotic drugs have become ever more popular, because they are thought to help people with mental health problems who do not respond quite so well to initial treatment. These newer drugs hold the promise of both reducing symptoms, such as hearing voices or seeing things, and reducing problematic side effects, such as sleepiness, weight gain, and shaking.
However, there is little research and comparison of the ways in which drugs differ from one another. This review examines the effectiveness of aripiprazole with other new antipsychotics.

Originally the review included 12 research trials. After an update search carried out in November 2012, 162 trials were added. Most of these trials were from China and although new data were added to the review, overall conclusions did not change. The review now has five comparisons with aripiprazole being compared with clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone.
For people with schizophrenia it may be important to know that aripiprazole may not be as good or effective as olanzapine but that it has less side effects. Aripiprazole is similar in effectiveness to risperidone and somewhat better than ziprasidone. Aripiprazole had less side- effects than olanzapine and risperidone (such as weight gain, sleepiness, heart problems, shaking and increased cholesterol levels). Aripiprazole was not as good as ziprasidone for dealing with restlessness or people’s inability to sit still. Comparison with other antipsychotic drugs as a group showed that people preferred taking aripiprazole. However, people with schizophrenia as well as mental health professionals and policy makers should know that the evidence is limited and mostly of low or very low quality. More trials and research is required, including on outcomes such as: quality of life; the views of service users and carers; and patient preference.

We searched for evidence on 6 July 2017 and identified a total of 13 trials that enrolled a total of 2556 women with a history of recurrent miscarriages. These trials found that giving progestogen medication to women with recurrent miscarriages early in their pregnancy may help lower the rates of miscarriage in that pregnancy from 27.5% to 20.1%. We believe that these findings are based on evidence of only moderate quality, so we cannot be certain about the results. We did not find that giving the progestogen medication by mouth, as a shot (injection), or in the vagina, was any better than any of the other ways. We also found that the trials showed that giving progestogen to women with prior recurrent miscarriages made the chances of having a live baby in the current pregnancy slightly higher. We are uncertain about the effect on the rate of preterm birth because the evidence is very low-quality. We did not find evidence of improvement in other outcomes such as newborn death, stillbirth, low birthweight, or newborn birth defects for women given progestogens. We found evidence from randomized controlled trials that giving progestogen medication may prevent miscarriage for women with recurrent previous miscarriages.
For the original review, we found six studies with 1342 participants. For this update we searched up to December 2014, but found no additional studies. Ibuprofen 400 mg plus high doses of codeine (25.6 mg to 60 mg) provided effective pain relief for over 6 in 10 (64%) of participants, compared with just under 2 in 10 (18%) of participants with placebo (high quality evidence).
Adverse events occurred at similar rates with the ibuprofen/codeine combination and placebo in these single dose studies (moderate quality evidence). No serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events occurred with the combination. It is important not to exceed the recommended dose for this combination painkiller.
In March 2017, we found 24 studies involving 5220 people. The main comparison was between usual oral doses of ketoprofen 50 mg and placebo, and dexketoprofen 25 mg and placebo. The studies tested single doses after wisdom tooth extraction, and after other types of surgery, mainly hip replacement and gynaecological operations. Studies included adults over a range of ages, and 7 out of 10 participants were women. The main outcome was participants having at least half of the maximum possible pain relief over the first six hours after taking the tablets. For ketoprofen, there were 594 participants in eight studies in the comparison with placebo (a dummy tablet). About 6 in 10 achieved at least half of the maximum possible pain relief with ketoprofen 50 mg compared with 2 in 10 with placebo. The number of participants who needed more painkillers within six hours was 5 in 10 with ketoprofen compared with 8 in 10 with placebo.
For dexketoprofen, there were 1177 participants in eight studies in the comparison with placebo. About 5 in 10 achieved at least half of the maximum possible pain relief with dexketoprofen 25 mg compared with 3 in 10 with placebo. The number of participants who needed more painkillers within six hours was 5 in 10 with dexketoprofen compared with 7 in 10 with placebo.
About 1 or 2 in 10 people had any side effects with ketoprofen, dexketoprofen, or placebo. Serious side effects were uncommon. Few people dropped out of the studies for any reason. The quality of the evidence was judged to be high for most outcomes. This research provides a very good indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially different is low.
We included 244 trials, with 28,619 participants. The included trials assessed the effects of different kinds of nutrition support (i.e. dietary advice, enriching regular food with extra protein and calories, protein shakes, feeding through a catheter directly into a vein or through a tube directly into the stomach or gut). The nutrition support was provided to people in the trial who were ill with many different types of diseases and undergoing different procedures. What they all had in common was that they were at risk by at least one measure, including the trialists' clinical opinion. We found no evidence of a difference between nutrition support and control for risk of death. We found that 8.3% people died at short-term follow-up in the control groups compared with 7.8% in those who had been given nutritional support (low quality of evidence). At the longest point of follow-up 13.2% people in the control groups died compared with 12.2% in those who had been given nutritional support (low quality of evidence). We found no evidence of a difference between nutrition support and control for risk of a serious complications in the short term. People in the control groups had a serious complication rate of 9.9% at short-term follow-up compared with 9.2% with nutrition (low quality of evidence). At long-term follow-up 15.2% of people in the control groups had a serious complication compared with 13.8% in the nutrition groups (low quality of evidence). These results are based on just over 21,000 participants. Nutrition may increase weight by about 1.32 kg compared with people in the control groups. The increase in weight of 1.32 kg on average is of uncertain benefit. We could not reliably assess the effects on quality of life due to the variation in the reporting of this information. When we looked at the different types of nutrition support, a secondary analysis suggested that tube-feeding might be beneficial, reducing serious complications at maximum follow-up, but the strength of this finding is low. The evidence for our conclusions is of low quality for death and serious complications, and very low quality for weight. All trials had a high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were all conducted in a way that may overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms of nutrition support). The results were consistent for death and serious complications, but there was a high level of variation in the effects on weight across the studies.
We found nine completed trials that compared giving to newborn babies, whose mothers had received opioids during labour, either naloxone or a placebo ('dummy drug'). These trials were conducted more than 30 years ago and they were generally very small including only about 300 infants in total. Most of the trials did not use reliable methods consistently. Evidence is up-to-date as of February 2018. The trials reported the effects of naloxone on the baby's breathing but did not assess the effect on the need for babies to be cared for in a neonatal unit (separated from their mother), whether they needed help with breathing, or on breastfeeding success. None of the trials assessed long-term development. We did not find any trials including babies born to mothers who had used opioids (whether prescribed or non-prescribed) during pregnancy. The available evidence was not sufficient to determine whether giving naloxone to babies whose mothers received opioids during birth was helpful or harmful.
We wanted to know whether NSAIDs, given alone or combined with other medications, can help people with CME following cataract surgery to see more clearly. We searched for studies that randomly assigned adults with CME after cataract surgery to be treated with NSAIDs, alone or with other medications. Studies compared NSAIDs with placebo (a dummy medicine with no active ingredients) or other active treatment (steroid or another NSAID). We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 9 studies that involved a total of 390 people with a mean age of 72 years; 72% were women. Three studies enrolled exclusively people with acute CME (fluid accumulation in the macula of less than 4 months' duration) after cataract surgery, 4 studies enrolled people with chronic CME (fluid presence in the macula which persisted for 4 months or longer) after cataract surgery, and the remaining 2 studies included people with varying durations of post-surgical fluid accumulation in the macula. NSAIDs might improve vision or reduce retinal swelling compared to placebo or a topical steroid (3 studies). 2 studies that treated people with chronic CME with NSAIDs for two months or less showed no effects on vision improvement. In contrast, the other two studies suggested that NSAIDs might improve vision after 90 to 120 days of treatment. We did not find any evidence about the effects of NSAIDs on other outcomes, such as persistent improvement of vision after treatment stopped or reduced fluid accumulation in the macula. topical NSAID might have little or no effects on vision compared to a different NSAID.
Most of the included studies either did not report data on unwanted effects or did not report differences in unwanted effects between groups receiving different treatments. Our confidence in the evidence was limited because studies did not include many participants, and they used different medications in different amounts for different durations. The studies did not examine all the outcomes of interest. The findings were also limited by the fact that the trials were published from 1977 to 2006, and many advances in cataract surgery techniques have occurred throughout and since that time. The evidence is up to date as of March 2022.
Four trials met the inclusion criteria. They included a total of 104 people; however, three trials did not provide results that we could include in the review. (One trial studied different kinds of foot orthoses, which are in-shoe devices that redistribute force and change gait), and two investigated the effects of adding botulinum toxin injections to various treatments such as stretching, exercises, splints, and footwear.) This review therefore only included the results of one trial, in which 47 children (aged between 5 and 14.5 years) received treatment with either plaster casts alone or plaster casts and injections of botulinum toxin A (BTX) into calf muscles. The study reported how much the children toe walked (based on their parents' observation), any change in ankle range of movement, and relapse (whether the children were still toe walking 12 months after treatment). The included study took place in Sweden and was not funded by anyone with a commercial interest in the results of the study. The evidence was too uncertain to determine whether or not there were differences in outcomes (amount of toe walking observed by parents, range of movement at the ankle, or recurrence of toe walking at 12 months) between children who received plaster casts and injections of BTX into calf muscles, compared to those who received plaster casts alone.
There were small numbers of adverse events in both groups, including calf pain and minor skin problems during treatment. The available evidence is too uncertain to determine whether treatment with BTX injections and plaster casts are any more effective than just plaster casts in children with toe walking not associated with a medical condition. The limited evidence found in this review indicates a need for future research on treatments for this condition.
Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 8 March 2018. The review investigated what treatments encourage the tooth to repair by periodontal healing. A total of four studies were included with a total of 183 participants with 257 teeth. One study involved children and young adults, with the other three involving children only. Each study evaluated a different treatment: hyperbaric oxygen, root canal pastes (Ledermix versus Ultracal), removal of the nerve of the tooth (pulp extirpation), and soaking the knocked out tooth in thymosin alpha 1. Each of the interventions aimed to reduce infection or change the inflammatory response or both, at the time of or shortly after the tooth or teeth were replanted. The evidence currently available is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions regarding the superiority of different interventions for knocked out and replanted permanent front teeth. There is urgent need for further well-designed randomised controlled trials. We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to problems with the design of the studies.
We found six studies, all from the USA, four of which targeted African Americans and two which targeted Latino or Chinese immigrants. Of the studies, four were experimental (1693 volunteers) and two reported the results of large, targeted campaigns run in whole communities and cities. The evidence is current to August 2016. The available evidence is insufficient to conclude whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more, less or equally effective in changing health behaviours than general mass media interventions. Only one study compared participants' smoking habits and intentions to quit following the receipt of either a culturally adapted smoking advice booklet or a booklet developed for the general population. They found little or no differences in smoking behaviours between the groups.
When compared to no mass media intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit lines, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. This conclusion is based on findings from three studies. One study gave participants access to a series of 12 live shows on cable TV with information on how to maintain a healthy weight through diet and physical activity. Compared to women who did not watch the shows, participants reported slightly increased physical activity and some positive changes to their dietary patterns; however, their body weight was no different over time. Two other studies were large-scale targeted campaigns in which smokers were encouraged to call a quit line for smoking cessation advice. The number of telephone calls from the target population increased considerably during the campaign.
This review also compared targeted mass media interventions versus mass media interventions with added personal interactions. These findings, based on three studies, were inconclusive.
None of the studies reported whether the interventions could have had any adverse effects, such as possible stigmatisation or increased resistance to messages.
Further studies directly comparing targeted mass media interventions with general mass media interventions would be useful. Few studies have investigated the effects of targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups who primarily speak a non-dominant language. Our confidence in the evidence of effect on all main outcomes is low to very low. This means that the true effect may be different or substantially different from the results presented in this review. We have moderate confidence in the estimated increase in the number of calls to smoking quit lines.
From the studies included in this review, there is some evidence to show that spironolactone is an effective treatment to decrease the degree of hirsutism, but insufficient evidence for the management of acne vulgaris. It appears to be more effective than finasteride 5mg/day, metformin and low dose cyproterone acetate.
At present there is no completed randomised controlled trial that has assessed the effects of male circumcision on acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men (MSM). Results from observational studies suggest that circumcision may be protective among MSM who practice primarily insertive anal sex, but the role of male circumcision overall in the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections among MSM remains to be determined.
We found two studies involving 453 people with sudden onset pulmonary embolism who were treated at home or in hospital. One study used the same treatment for the people treated at home or in hospital, and the second study used different treatments. We did not find any clear differences in the number of deaths, bleeding, new clots, or patient satisfaction between the groups of people who were treated at home or in the hospital.
Neither study provided information on side effects of the treatment or on whether people were able to follow the correct instructions at home. We are not very certain about the evidence from the two included studies. This is because there were only small numbers of people in the studies (and small numbers of events) and because we could not be sure that reports of studies where no effect was shown were ever published. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to May 2021.
We identified 17 clinical trials recruiting 2422 stroke patients (searching completed to January 2017). Patients who were recruited tended to have a moderate degree of disability (able to walk with assistance) and be sufficiently well to consider returning home. We categorised services as those based on a multidisciplinary ESD team (with different levels of co-ordination and delivery) and those with no multidisciplinary team co-ordination (no ESD team). The length of initial stay in hospital was reduced by approximately five days for the ESD group. At an average of six months after their stroke ESD patients were more likely to be living at home (an extra five patients living at home for every 100 receiving ESD services; moderate-quality evidence). They were also more likely to be independent in daily activities (an extra six patients independent for every 100 receiving ESD services; moderate-quality evidence). We identified no apparent hazards in terms of patient mood or quality of life, carer mood or quality of life, or the risk of readmission to hospital. The greatest reductions in disability seemed to be present in trials based around a co-ordinated ESD team. When compared with usual care, costs of ESD services ranged from a reduction to a modest increase. The quality of the evidence was downgraded to 'moderate' for the main outcomes of death, discharge home or disability. This was because it was impossible to hide the treating service from participants or healthcare workers. These conclusions were not dependent on trials judged to be lower quality because of poor design or missing data. More information was missing for some of the other outcome measures, which we have downgraded to low-quality evidence. Appropriately resourced ESD services with co-ordinated multidisciplinary team input can reduce disability and the length of time in hospital at least for a selected group of people with stroke. Results are unclear for services that are not based on a co-ordinated multidisciplinary team input. We did not identify any substantial harmful effects.
We included nine trials that randomised 2954 women to hypnosis or to control groups receiving; standard care, relaxation training or supportive counselling. In eight trials the women were trained in self-hypnosis during pregnancy for later use during labour. In the other trial, the hypnotherapist was present during the woman's labour.
There were no clear differences between women in the hypnosis group and those in the control groups in terms of the number of normal deliveries, women's satisfaction with the method of pain relief or women's sense of coping with labour. However, fewer women in the hypnosis group used pain relief medication for labour. Epidural use did not differ between the groups. All the evidence for these outcomes was found to be of low quality. The studies measured a range of other outcomes and no consistent differences were found. Hypnosis may reduce the overall use of pain medication during labour, but does not seem to reduce the use of epidurals. Women using hypnosis are no more likely to have a normal vaginal birth. There is currently not enough evidence to say whether hypnosis helps women feel more satisfied about their pain relief in labour, nor whether it improves their sense of coping with labour. Further high-quality research is needed and should include assessment of women's satisfaction with pain relief and sense of coping in labour. Our conclusions about the impact hypnosis has on pain during labour and childbirth may change with future, high-quality research.
The results of the existing trials suggest that this may be effective, but the evidence is not conclusive because most of the studies of this approach have methodological problems. A recent laboratory study also suggests that the method has an active ingredient. Further research may be worthwhile.
We found 81 studies including 112,159 smokers in primary care patients. Studies looked at many ways to improve the delivery and success of stop-smoking support in primary care. Some looked at just one strategy, and some looked at two or more in combination. More than one study looked at each of the following individual strategies: additional counseling; free medications; feedback to participants on markers of their individual health risk linked to smoking; printed materials tailored to participants; health provider training; and rewards to health providers for providing support.
Most studies took place in Europe (39 studies) and the USA (26 studies). More people probably stop smoking for at least six months when they are given additional counseling (22 studies, 18,150 people), free stop-smoking medications (10 studies, 7560 people), or printed materials tailored to them (6 studies, 15,978 people), as part of stop-smoking support in primary care. We are uncertain whether providing people with feedback on markers of their individual health risk, providing healthcare providers with training, or with rewards for providing stop-smoking support, help more people to quit.
Thirty-four studies looked at more than one strategy to improve stop-smoking treatment in primary care. Combinations differed greatly across studies, with different levels of success, and it was not possible to draw conclusions on what worked best.
There was not enough information to help us clearly understand whether there were increases in the amount of stop-smoking support provided or increases in the numbers of people making a quit attempt. For some of our results the data varied widely, for some there was not enough data, and in some cases there were quality issues with included studies.
We are moderately confident that people are more likely to quit smoking if someone in addition to the primary care doctor also provides stop-smoking counseling, if free stop-smoking medications are provided, or if printed materials tailored to the participant are provided as part of stop-smoking support offered in primary care. However, results might change as further evidence becomes available.
We are less confident about the effectiveness of providing people with feedback on markers of their individual health risk, giving healthcare providers training on stop-smoking treatments, or giving healthcare providers rewards for giving stop-smoking support. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available.
The evidence is current to January 2018. We included seven studies, recruiting 493 patients. The participants were adults having septoplasty in all of the included studies and the percentage of females ranged from 20.7% to 58.3%. Two studies, recruiting 142 participants, assessed local anaesthetic injection. Four studies, recruiting 301 participants, used nasal packing postoperatively and assessed the addition of a local anaesthetic to the nasal pack. One study, recruiting 50 participants, assessed a regional nerve block. No studies were funded by the anaesthetic drug manufacturer. Local anaesthetic injection compared to no treatment/placebo
The main outcome we looked at was the effect on reducing pain at 12, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Two studies assessed local injection of anaesthesia, but neither reported on pain at these times. It is unclear whether local injection increased postoperative vomiting. Neither study reported uncontrollable postoperative bleeding.
Local anaesthetic application via nasal packing compared to no packing/packing with placebo
Four studies that used nasal packing after the operation assessed the addition of a local anaesthetic to the pack compared to packing with a placebo added. Four of these studies reported pain at 12 or 24 hours (or both) postoperatively. Local anaesthetic added to nasal packing reduced pain by 17.0 points on a 100-point scale at 12 hours postoperatively and by 7.5 points at 24 hours postoperatively. These studies did not report on pain at 48 hours postoperatively. Local anaesthetic application by nasal packing decreased the need for additional analgesia (painkillers) postoperatively. No studies reported postoperative vomiting or uncontrollable postoperative bleeding.
No studies evaluated local anaesthetic application via nasal packing compared to no packing.
Regional nerve block compared to no treatment/placebo
One study compared a regional nerve block with no treatment, but this study did not report postoperative pain or any of our other outcomes. We graded the quality of evidence for the use of local anaesthetic injection as low, which means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. We downgraded the quality of the evidence because of the small number of patients and events. We graded the quality of evidence for the use of local anaesthetic applied to nasal packing as low at 12 hours postoperatively and very low at 48 hours. We downgraded the quality of the evidence because of the poor conduct of the studies and because the results were not similar across studies. We did not grade the quality of evidence for the use of regional nerve block because none of our review outcomes were reported by the one study looking at this. The addition of local anaesthesia to nasal packs (if these are being used) following septal surgery may reduce postoperative pain within the first 12 hours postoperatively compared to nasal packing with a placebo added. However, our review revealed a lack of evidence on which to base comparisons of the various types of local anaesthesia. This review should prompt further research comparing local anaesthesia by injection, as an addition to nasal packing and as a regional nerve block following septal surgery.
This review provides evidence that group-based parenting programmes improve childhood behaviour problems and the development of positive parenting skills in the short-term, whilst also reducing parental anxiety, stress and depression. Evidence for the longer-term effects of these programmes is unavailable. These group-based parenting programmes achieve good results at a cost of approximately $2500 (£1712 or €2217) per family. These costs are modest when compared with the long-term social, educational and legal costs associated with childhood conduct problems.
This review found one study, involving 293 patients, comparing the long-term efficacy and side effects of combining inhaled corticosteroid with tiotropium and a long-acting beta2-agonist. In this study there were not enough patients for us to be able to draw any firm conclusions as to whether combining inhaled corticosteroid with tiotropium and the long-acting beta2-agonist is better or worse than using only tiotropium and the long-acting beta2-agonist. More long-term studies need to be done in order to better understand the effect of treatment with inhaled corticosteroid, tiotropium and a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Vitamin C has been proposed for treating respiratory infections since it was isolated in the 1930s. It became particularly popular in the 1970s when Nobel laureate Linus Pauling concluded from earlier placebo-controlled trials that vitamin C would prevent and alleviate the common cold. Over two dozen new trials were undertaken thereafter. Vitamin C has been widely sold and used as a preventive and therapeutic agent.
This review is restricted to placebo-controlled trials testing 0.2 g/day or more of vitamin C. Regular ingestion of vitamin C had no effect on common cold incidence in the ordinary population, based on 29 trial comparisons involving 11,306 participants. However, regular supplementation had a modest but consistent effect in reducing the duration of common cold symptoms, which is based on 31 study comparisons with 9745 common cold episodes. In five trials with 598 participants exposed to short periods of extreme physical stress (including marathon runners and skiers) vitamin C halved the common cold risk. The published trials have not reported adverse effects of vitamin C.
Trials of high doses of vitamin C administered therapeutically, starting after the onset of symptoms, showed no consistent effect on the duration or severity of common cold symptoms. However, only a few therapeutic trials have been carried out and none have examined children, although the effect of prophylactic vitamin C has been greater in children. One large trial with adults reported benefit from an 8 g therapeutic dose at the onset of symptoms, and two therapeutic trials using five-day supplementation reported benefit. More trials are necessary to settle the possible role of therapeutic vitamin C, meaning administration immediately after the onset of symptoms.
We analysed six studies that investigated the use of several different types of antibody therapies in 278 adult patients following lung transplantation. Flaws in study designs were found that indicated the studies were at risk of overestimating benefits and underestimating harms.
Our analysis compared several types of antibodies, but with one exception - that antithymocyte globulin seemed to increase some adverse events - we found no significant differences in lung survival or rejection for any of the treatments. There was some uncertainty about this effect because the study was too small to be sure that observed benefits would apply to a larger population. We found no significant differences among therapies in terms of infection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease, or cancer.
Few investigated the use of T-cell antibodies after lung transplantation, and these included small numbers of participants. These limitations meant that our findings did not necessarily indicate no differences existed among comparisons in our analysis. To overcome this problem, larger and more robust randomised studies that assess the benefits and harms of antibodies against T-cells for people following lung transplantation are needed.
This review identified four controlled trials involving 127,891 men and 9342 women who were randomly assigned to aortic aneurysm screening using ultrasound or no screening. Only one trial included women. Two of the trials were conducted in the UK, one in Denmark and one in Australia. The results provide evidence of a benefit from screening in men with a strongly significant reduction in deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysm. The odds ratio (OR) for death was 0.60 (range 0.47 to 0.78, three trials) in men aged 65 to 83 years but was not reduced for women. From one trial there was also a decreased incidence of ruptured aneurysm in men but not women.
All-cause mortality was not significantly different between screened and unscreened groups some three to five years after screening, which is to be expected given the relative infrequency of abdominal aortic aneurysm as a cause of death.
Men who had been screened underwent more surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (OR 2.03; range 1.59 to 2.59, four trials) but resource analysis appears to demonstrate overall cost effectiveness of screening. There were no data on life expectancy, complications of surgery or quality of life.
We included 22 studies, with a total of 1984 children aged 2 to 16 years with symptoms of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. In three studies, a sleep study was also performed as part of the diagnosis. Children underwent tonsillectomy or tonsillotomy, with or without removal of the adenoid, and were followed after the operation for six days to six years. Nineteen of these studies measured some of the data we were looking to collect and analyse. However, we could only combine results from a limited number of studies as each study measured different outcomes and used different measurement instruments to do this. There were also difficulties in accessing the raw data from lots of studies. Children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing who are selected for tonsil surgery and who have a tonsillotomy seem to have a faster recovery from the operation compared to children who have a tonsillectomy, in particular in terms of return to their normal activity (four days quicker). Children who have a tonsillotomy may also have a slightly lower risk of having problems after the operation that need treatment with medication or further surgery than those who have a tonsillectomy (2.6% versus 4.9%). Any potential differences in terms of blood loss during the operation (14 mL) and pain scores at 24 hours after the operation (1.09 of a point on a 10-point scale) in favour of tonsillotomy were not considered noticeable.
Very few studies measured the effects of the two operations on the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing itself, quality of life of the child, the recurrence of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing or the need for a reoperation. Those that did found no evidence of a difference between the children who underwent tonsillectomy or tonsillotomy but these findings should be interpreted with great caution since the evidence derived from these studies was mostly of very low certainty. The large majority of the studies included in this review had an unclear to high risk of bias and the evidence for most outcomes was of low to very low quality, meaning that the results are very uncertain. This means that we need more information from well-designed studies on the long-term outcomes of tonsillectomy and tonsillotomy to help parents and ENT surgeons choose which type of tonsil operation is best for children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing who require surgery.
The authors of the review identified eight randomised studies involving 2007 adult patients with a history of previous treatment failures in outpatient settings. The heroin users on the programs were requested to attend the clinic to receive and inject prescribed heroin from two to three times a day. Adverse events were consistently more frequent in the heroin groups. The trialists recommend that the treatment should be properly established so that necessary intensive care can be provided in an emergency. According with the current evidence, heroin prescription should be indicated to people who is currently or have previously failed maintenance treatment, and it should be provided in clinical settings where proper follow-up is ensured.
Fifteen trials, involving 1022 adults with potentially or evidently unstable fractures, were included. While all trials compared external fixation versus plaster cast immobilisation, there was considerable variation in their characteristics especially in terms of patient characteristics and the method of external fixation. Weak methodology, such as using inadequate methods of randomisation and outcome assessment, means that the possibility of serious bias can not be excluded.
The review found that external fixation reduced fracture redisplacement that prompted further treatment and generally improved final anatomical outcome. It appears to improve function too but this needs to be confirmed. The complications, such a pin tract infection, associated with external fixation were many but were generally minor. Serious complications occurred in both groups. The review concludes that there is some evidence to support the use of external fixation for these fractures.
We included 25 randomised controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) involving a total of 5111 participants. We identified nine comparisons, including progesterone compared with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment, different dosages of vaginal progesterone supplement, different routes of progesterone supplement, GnRH agonist compared with placebo or no treatment, vaginal progesterone compared with GnRH agonist, and hCG compared with no treatment. All studies reported pregnancy outcomes, but only one study reported adverse events. All included studies reported on intrauterine insemination, a procedure where sperm is placed directly into the uterus (womb) using a thin, flexible plastic tube inserted through the vagina and cervix. No trial evaluated the effect of luteal support when trying to get pregnant naturally. Progesterone supplementation versus placebo or no treatment
We are uncertain if vaginal progesterone increases live birth/ongoing pregnancy rate when compared to placebo or no treatment in any of the types of ovarian stimulation cycle evaluated (gonadotropin (injectable hormones), gonadotropin plus oral stimulation, and oral stimulation alone). We are uncertain if progesterone reduces miscarriage rates. Vaginal progesterone may slightly increase clinical pregnancy (when the pregnancy is confirmed through ultrasound and a heartbeat is be detected). Progesterone supplementation may increase clinical pregnancy slightly in all types of ovarian stimulation cycle (gonadotropin (injectable hormones), gonadotropin plus oral stimulation, and oral stimulation alone). However, given the low certainty of the evidence, it is unclear whether the treatment makes a difference for the other prespecified outcomes (adverse events or multiple pregnancy rate (having twins/triplets)).
300 mg versus 600 mg vaginal progesterone
It is unclear if 300 mg vaginal progesterone has an effect on live birth, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage, or adverse events when compared to 600 mg vaginal progesterone.
Different routes of progesterone administration versus vaginal route
We do not know if other routes of progesterone (intramuscular, oral, or subcutaneous) have an effect on live birth, ongoing pregnancy, and miscarriage when compared to vaginal progesterone. Intramuscular progesterone may result in a large increase in adverse events (pain at site of injection), although the certainty of the evidence was very low.
Other interventions versus placebo or no treatment
We do not know if other interventions (GnRH agonist or hCG injection) have an effect on our prespecified outcomes. The evidence for most comparisons was of very low to low certainty. The main limitations of the evidence were poor reporting of study methods and imprecision due to low numbers of women in the studies.
We wanted to find out if topical therapy (a medicine in the form of a cream, foam, gel, lotion, or ointment that is put onto the surface of the skin), light therapy (a treatment method using different colours of light to irradiate the skin lesion (damaged) area), and complementary therapy (an additional therapy other than conventional medicine, such as acupuncture, diet, and herbal medicine) have an effect by reducing lesion counts, improving acne severity as assessed by the participant and investigator, improving quality of life, and reducing serious or less serious adverse (unwanted or harmful) events. We searched for systematic reviews that looked at topical, light-based, and complementary interventions for acne and acne scars. We summarised the results of the systematic reviews and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. This overview includes six systematic reviews, involving 40,910 people with acne from 275 studies and 1316 people with acne scars from 37 studies. The age of the participants ranged from 10 to 59 years, with the average age ranging from 18 to 30 years. Four reviews included original trials involving only female participants and three reviews included original trials with only male participants.
We do not know if benzoyl peroxide, when compared with placebo or no treatment, has an effect on lesion counts, acne severity as assessed by the participant and investigator, or the rate of less serious adverse events. For the comparison between benzoyl peroxide and placebo or no treatment, we found no reviews to help us answer our question about serious adverse events or quality of life.
We do not know if benzoyl peroxide, when compared with adapalene (a topical retinoid: one of the most common drugs for treating acne), has an effect on lesion counts and less serious adverse events. Benzoyl peroxide may make little to no difference to acne severity as assessed by the participant (1123 people in four studies) or the investigator (1965 people in three studies) when compared with adapalene. For the comparison between benzoyl peroxide and adapalene, we found no reviews to help us answer our question about serious adverse events or quality of life.
It is unclear if benzoyl peroxide, when compared to clindamycin (a topical antibiotic: a medicine that kills bacteria and fungi, or stops bacteria growing), has an effect on lesion counts or the investigator's assessment of acne severity. Compared with clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide may make little to no difference to the participant's self-assessment of acne severity (240 people in one study) or the rate of less serious adverse events (2842 people in five studies). For the comparison between benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin, we found no reviews to help us answer our question about serious adverse events or quality of life.
We found no reviews to help us answer our question for the following comparisons: topical antibiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, topical retinoids compared with placebo or no treatment, and topical retinoids compared with topical antibiotics. We have little to very little confidence in our findings, and the results of further research could change the results of this overview.
The main factors that reduced our confidence in the evidence are as follows. Firstly, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Secondly, not all the studies provided data about everything that they were interested in. Thirdly, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for the outcomes we were looking at. Finally, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment. The evidence is up-to-date to December 2021.
This review identified two randomised trials of parent-initiated oral corticosteroids in the management of an intermittent wheezing illness in children. There was no evidence of more benefit than harm. Widespread use of this strategy cannot be recommended at present. Further randomised clinical trials are required.
Therefore, we reviewed the literature to find studies that compare the effects of oral-and-written to those of computer-assisted dietary history taking on the quality of collected data as well as on the quality of patients' lives. We found only one publication with 38 study participants that compared the two methods of history taking over a total of eight weeks. This study found that computer-assisted diet history taking would be as accurate as the oral-and-written method and may potentially allow doctors to spend more time with their patients to discuss as opposed to taking measurements. However, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions of which of the two methods is more effective from a single small study. We therefore suggest that more primary research is required in this area to allow an informed decision to be made by physicians, patients and policymakers.
We wanted to find out if mesh hernia repair differed from non-mesh hernia repair in terms of infections related to the surgical wound, deaths after surgery, the return of the hernia (recurrence), and complications. We also wanted to see how many meshes were later removed due to complications. We searched for studies that examined mesh compared with non-mesh hernia repairs in adult people who needed emergency surgery for their groin hernia.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as the quality of the studies and the number of participants. We found 15 studies involving 1241 people, of which 626 received a mesh repair, and 615 received a non-mesh hernia repair. Most studies were conducted in China (10 studies), and the remaining studies were conducted in the Middle East and South Asia. The studies lasted from 11 months to over 11 years.
We found that mesh hernia repair might not affect the risk of wound infections or deaths within 30 days of surgery when compared with non-mesh hernia repair.
No hernias returned within 30 days. Some hernias returned after one year following the repair, but the analysis could not find any differences in this risk between mesh and non-mesh hernia repairs.
No meshes were removed within 30 days of repair in the least severe cases of emergency groin hernia but, based on one study, one out of 15 meshes were removed in the more severe cases. There are significant limitations of the evidence, therefore we can not draw strong conclusions. Firstly, we are not certain about the evidence since the overall quality of the included studies was very low. Also, we could not find data about everything we wanted to find out, and the few studies that reported the things we were interested in were unfortunately too small to show any potential differences in the treatment effects. This evidence is up-to-date to August 2022.
The review identified 102 relevant studies, 85 of which were on the use of music in hospital. Other environmental aspects considered were: aromas (two studies), audiovisual distractions (five studies), decoration (one study), air quality (three studies), bedroom type (one study), flooring (two studies), furniture and furnishings (one study), lighting (one study), temperature (one study), and multiple design changes (two studies). No studies meeting the inclusion criteria were found to evaluate: art, access to nature for example through hospital gardens, atriums, flowers, and plants, ceilings, interventions to reduce hospital noise, patient controls, technologies, way-finding aids, or the provision of windows.
Overall, it appears that music in hospital may help improve patient-reported outcomes such as anxiety; however, there is less evidence to support the use of music for physiological outcomes (such as reducing heart rate and blood pressure) and for reducing the use of medications. For other aspects of hospital environments, there are not very many well designed studies to help with making evidence-based design decisions. The studies that have been included in this review show that physical changes made to 'improve' the hospital environment on the whole do no harm.
We found one trial comparing albumin to normal saline; no trials were found comparing albumin to other fluids used to treat hypotension. This trial showed no difference between albumin and normal saline in all outcomes except for the amount of additional saline given, which was less in the group treated with albumin. We concluded that normal saline should be the first choice for treating IDH.
We searched the medical literature on 8 March 2016 and for this updated review we included 19 randomised controlled trials involving 1398 women with GDM and their babies. The overall risk of bias of the trials was unclear or moderate because of methodological limitations and the quality of the evidence was low or very low. The studies were generally small, few compared the same or similar interventions, and the outcomes they reported on were not comprehensive.
Ten different dietary advice comparisons were included. These were: 1) a low-moderate glycaemic index (GI) diet with a moderate-high GI diet (four trials); 2) an energy-restricted diet with a diet with no energy restriction (three trials); 3) a 'Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)' diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products with a control diet (three trials); 4) a low-carbohydrate diet with a high-carbohydrate diet (two trials); 5) a high unsaturated fat diet with a low unsaturated fat diet (two trials); 6) a low-GI diet with a high-fibre moderate-GI diet (one trial); 7) diet recommendations and diet-related behavioural advice with diet recommendations only (one trial); 8) a soy protein-enriched diet with a diet with no soy protein (one trial); 9) a high-fibre diet with a standard-fibre diet (one trial); and 10) an ethnic-specific diet with a standard healthy diet (one trial).
The review found no clear differences between the different types of dietary advice on the number of women with high blood pressure during pregnancy including pre-eclampsia (nine trials in six different diet comparisons), large-for-gestational age babies (eight trials in seven different diet comparisons), perinatal deaths including stillbirth and death around the time of the birth (three trials in two different diet comparisons), type 2 diabetes development for the mother (two trials in two different diet comparisons), and a composite outcome of neonatal deaths or ill-health (one trial in one diet comparison). No clear difference was seen in the number of babies delivered by caesarean section (10 trials in eight different diet comparisons) except for a reduction with a DASH diet. None of the included trials reported on later disability during childhood for the babies.
A range of other outcomes were looked at with no consistent differences reported between the different types of dietary advice. Outcomes related to longer-term health for women and their babies, and the use and costs of health services were largely not reported. Dietary advice is the main strategy for managing GDM, however it remains unclear what type of advice is best. Conclusive evidence from randomised controlled trials is not yet available to guide practice, although a wide range of dietary advice interventions have been investigated. Few trials have compared the same or similar interventions, trials have been small and have reported limited findings. Further large, well-designed, randomised controlled trials are required to assess the effects of different types of dietary advice for women with GDM for improving health outcomes for women and their babies in the short and long term.
Women who received chemotherapy after surgery (starting within eight weeks of surgery) survived approximately 25% longer than those receiving radiotherapy after surgery. Assuming that 60% of women with stage III endometrial cancer usually survive at least five years after surgery and radiotherapy, this would increase to 75% if they receive surgery and chemotherapy instead, depending on other risk factors, such as age. The risk of death which might have been caused by treatment was low with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy but we could not be sure if one was more harmful than the other. Chemotherapy may be associated with more side-effects (low blood counts, nerve damage and hair loss) compared with radiotherapy.
In the trial that compared two different chemotherapy treatments, there was no clear evidence that using three anti-cancer drugs was better than using two. However, the final overall survival results of this trial have not yet been reported. Severe side-effects were much more common in women treated with three anti-cancer drugs than two drugs. Chemotherapy appears to be more effective than radiotherapy after surgery for women with stage III and IV endometrial cancer but may cause more side-effects. More research is needed to determine whether the addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy improves outcomes and which anti-cancer drugs are best.
To find the best answer, we looked for studies in which investigators compared any anticoagulant to another medicine, to a dummy medicine that does not contain any active ingredients (placebo), or to normal care. To make the comparison fair, all patients in these studies must have had the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive the anticoagulant, the other treatment, or normal care. We included in this updated review 28 studies involving 24,025 people with stroke. Two studies enrolled participants within 12 hours of stroke onset, four within 24 hours, and 10 within 48 hours. People treated with anticoagulants did not have less long-term disability, and they experienced more bleeding. Anticoagulant-treated patients had a lesser chance of developing blood clots in their legs and in their lungs following their stroke, but these benefits were offset by an increased number of bleeds. We used standard methods to assess the certainty of the evidence. We rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods, numbers of participants included in the studies, and consistency of findings across studies. Low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain about the results. In the same way, high-certainty evidence means we are very certain about the results of this review. This review did not provide any evidence to suggest that early use of anticoagulants is beneficial overall for people with stroke caused by blood clots. More research is needed to find out if there are ways to select people with stroke who will benefit most from anticoagulants without suffering the bleeding complications.
This review of four trials, involving 2024 participants, showed that ETAs reduced the risk of DIND but did not improve clinical outcomes and had potentially serious side effects, such as low blood pressure and chest infection. There is not enough evidence to conclude that ETAs are beneficial in SAH.
The authors of this review evaluated whether these filters were safe to use and effective in reducing the risk of death, length of stay in intensive care and hospital, impairment of kidney functioning, costs of care, and improving quality of life in patients undergoing heart valve surgery. We searched the literature and found eight studies, comprising at least 185 patients, that met our inclusion criteria for the review. However, only one study with 24 participants could provide data on any of our review outcomes. The study showed that length of stay in intensive care and length of stay in hospital were not different between patients who had surgery with the leukodepletion filter compared to a standard filter. None of the studies reported on death rates or five of the seven secondary outcomes that the review aimed to evaluate.
The authors concluded that there were not enough good quality trials in patients undergoing valve surgery to determine whether leukodepletion works. More good quality research studies with relevant outcome measures are required. A forthcoming study will help to clarify the findings in a future update of the review.
This review could not provide evidence from randomised controlled trials that routine supplementation with vitamin B6 during pregnancy is of any benefit, other than one trial suggesting protection against dental decay. It may cause harm if too much is taken, as amounts well above the recommended daily allowance are associated with numbness and difficulty in walking.
Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin which plays vital roles in numerous metabolic processes in the human body and helps with the development of the nervous system. Vitamin B6 is contained in many foods including meat, poultry, fish, vegetables, and bananas. It is thought that B6 may play a role in the prevention of pre-eclampsia, where the mother’s blood pressure is high with large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction, and in babies being born too early (preterm birth). Vitamin B6 may be helpful for reducing nausea in pregnancy. This review of four trials (involving 1646 pregnant women) assessed routine B6 supplementation during pregnancy with the aim of reducing the chances of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. Vitamin B6 as oral capsules or lozenges resulted in a decreased risk of dental decay in pregnant women in one trial. Lozenges had a greater effect, suggesting a local or topical effect of pyridoxine within the oral cavity. We did not find any clear differences in the risk of eclampsia or pre-eclampsia (three trials and two trials, respectively, low quality evidence). The studies did not have enough data to be able to make any other useful assessments.
The included trials were conducted between 1960 and 1983 and did not include important newborn outcomes that have only recently been associated with vitamin B6, such as decreases in cardiovascular malformations and orofacial clefts. The trials began at different times during pregnancy, most had high rates of loss to follow-up, and adverse effects of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) use were not assessed.
Further research assessing outcomes such as orofacial clefts, cardiovascular malformations, neurological development, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia and adverse events would be helpful.
It is not clear whether intratympanic treatment with corticosteroids is effective, or which of these treatments (intratympanic or systemic) is best for treating this condition. We searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature, compared the results and summarised the evidence. We also assessed how certain the evidence was, considering factors such as study size and the way studies were conducted. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. We found 30 studies that included 2133 people. These studies compared intratympanic treatment with corticosteroids with no treatment, with placebo (sham or dummy treatment) and with corticosteroids that were taken by mouth or injection into the body (systemic corticosteroids). We took into account whether people were having their first treatment for sudden deafness or whether they had previously had some other kind of treatment (which had not worked). We did not find any studies that compared intratympanic corticosteroids to no treatment or placebo (dummy) treatment.
Intratympanic corticosteroids might result in little or no difference in hearing when compared to people who receive systemic corticosteroids, and might make little to no difference in the number of people whose hearing improves. The side effects may be different with these two types of treatment. With intratympanic treatment, people may have an increase in the risk of dizziness or ear pain as compared to systemic corticosteroids, typically at the time of injection, and some may develop a small hole in the ear drum. However, systemic treatment may also cause an increased risk of different side effects, such as problems with sugar levels in the blood.
Taking intratympanic corticosteroids as well as systemic corticosteroids might result in a small improvement in hearing compared to systemic corticosteroids alone, but it is uncertain how many people would notice an improvement. As above, intratympanic treatment may cause some side effects, but we cannot be certain of the number of people who may experience these. When compared to no treatment or a placebo (dummy) treatment, intratympanic corticosteroids may result in a much larger number of people having an improvement in their hearing but may only improve hearing slightly. As with first treatment, intratympanic injections might cause some side effects, such as pain or dizziness at the time of the injection, or development of a small hole in the ear drum. We are not certain how often these side effects will happen.
We are very uncertain whether adding intratympanic treatment to systemic treatment will result in an improvement in hearing. We considered most of the evidence we found to be of low or very low certainty. This was because there were often some problems with how the studies had been carried out, there may have been few people included in the studies and sometimes results from different studies were conflicting. Therefore, the conclusions of this review may change as new studies are published. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 23 September 2021.
This updated review includes 94 (62 new to this update) randomised controlled trials involving 9821 participants. Most participants were women living in their own home. Some studies included frail people residing in hospital or residential facilities.
Many of the trials had flawed or poorly described methods that meant that their findings could be biased. Most studies only reported outcome up to the end of the exercise programme. Thus they did not check to see if there were any lasting effects.
We chose to report on measures of balance that relate to everyday activities such as time taken to stand up, walk three metres, turn and return to sitting (Timed Up & Go test); ability to stand on one leg (necessary for safe walking in well lit and dark conditions), walking speed (better balance allows faster walking), and activities of daily living (Berg Balance Scale, comprising 14 items). These were our primary outcomes. 

There were eight categories of exercise programmes. These are listed below together with those measures of balance for which there was some evidence of a positive (statistically significant) effect from the specific type of exercise at the end of the exercise programme. Some trials tested more than one type of exercise. It is important to note that the evidence for each outcome was generally from only a few of the trials for each exercise category. 

1. Gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks (19 studies of which 10 provided data for one or more primary outcomes). Positive effects of exercise were found for the Timed Up & Go test, walking speed, and the Berg Balance Scale. 

2. Strengthening exercise (including resistance or power training) (21 studies of which 11 provided data for one or more primary outcomes). Positive effects were found for the Timed Up & Go Test; standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes closed; and walking speed. 

3. 3D (3 dimensional) exercise (including Tai Chi, qi gong, dance, yoga) (15 studies of which seven provided data for one or more primary outcomes). Positive effects were found for the Timed Up & Go Test; standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes open, and with eyes closed; and the Berg Balance Scale. 

4. General physical activity (walking) (seven studies of which five provided data for one or more primary outcomes). 

5. General physical activity (cycling) (one study which provided data for walking speed). 

6. Computerised balance training using visual feedback (two studies, neither of which provided data for any primary outcome). 

7. Vibration platform used as intervention (three studies of which one provided data for the Timed Up & Go Test).
8. Multiple exercise types (combinations of the above) (43 studies of which 29 provided data for one or more primary outcomes). Positive effects were found for the Timed Up & Go Test; standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes open, and with eyes closed; and the Berg Balance Scale.
In general, effective programmes ran three times a week for three months and involved dynamic exercise in standing. Few adverse events were reported.
The review concluded that there was weak evidence that some exercise types are moderately effective, immediately post intervention, in improving balance in older people. However, the missing data and compromised methods of many included trials meant that further high quality research is required.
This Cochrane review is current to 15 February 2021. Nineteen trials (1035 participants) compared ultrasound-guided injection to ‘blind’ injection. Fourteen trials included participants with rotator cuff disease, four with adhesive capsulitis, and one with mixed shoulder pain. Trials were performed in Korea, Taiwan, Iran, Turkey, Australia, Norway, Spain, Ireland, India and Switzerland. Most participants were female, with a mean age from 31 to 60 years, and mean symptom duration from 2 to 23 months. Six studies reported funding sources. Compared to injection into the shoulder without image guidance, ultrasound-guided injection resulted in little to no benefit at three to six weeks:
Pain (lower scores mean less pain)
Improved by 0.5 points more (0.2 more to 0.8 more) on a 0 to 10-point scale. Differences of 0.5 to 1.0 points are considered slight or small and are unlikely to be clinically important.
- People who had ultrasound-guided injection rated their pain as 2.6 points
- People who had injection without image guidance rated their pain as 3.1 points
Function (higher scores mean better function)
Improved by 2.4 points more (0.2 points worse to 5.1 points more) on a 0 to 100-point scale. Differences below 10 points are considered slight or small and are unlikely to be clinically important.
- People who had ultrasound-guided injection rated their function as 70.4 points
- People who had injection without image guidance rated their function as 68 points
Quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life)
Improved by 2.8 points (0.7 worse to 6.4 better) on a 0 to 100-point scale
- People who had ultrasound-guided injection rated their quality of life as 67.8 points
- People who had injection without image guidance rated their quality of life as 65 points
Treatment success (defined as pain moderately or a great deal better)
22% more people rated their treatment a success (4% fewer to 62% more), or 22 more people out of 100.
- 61 out of 100 people reported treatment success with ultrasound-guided injection
- 39 out of 100 people reported treatment success with injection without image guidance
Adverse events
7% fewer people (15% fewer to 7% more) had adverse events (post-injection pain, facial redness and warmth) with ultrasound-guided injection.
- 18 out of 100 people reported adverse events with ultrasound-guided injection
- 25 out of 100 people reported adverse events with injection without image guidance
Serious adverse events
Five trials reported that there were no serious adverse events (like infection or nerve injury) with or without use of ultrasound guidance of the injection.
Withdrawals due to adverse events
One trial reported that 1/53 (or 19 out of 1000) people who received the injection without image guidance withdrew from the study due to adverse events, while no one (0/53) in the ultrasound-guided injection group withdrew due to adverse events. Low to moderate-certainty evidence shows that in people with shoulder pain, ultrasound-guided injection does not provide clinically important benefits in pain, function or quality of life compared with non-image-guided injection, nor does it reduce the risk of adverse events. These findings were consistent across different shoulder conditions. Further high-quality research is unlikely to change the conclusions of this review.
This review tried to answer the question: does immediate referral to an SIC result in a better outcome than delayed referral? However, a comprehensive search failed to find any controlled studies and so it is not yet possible to answer the question. The reviewers call for appropriate research to be done.
We searched electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (where participants are assigned at random to either a treatment or a control arm) published up to 3 February 2017 that investigated respiratory muscle training in people with MS. In addition, we contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. We found six trials involving 195 participants with MS. Training consisted of two or three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, twice a day for at least three days a week, and interventions lasted for six weeks to three months. Follow-up ranged from no follow-up to six months. Two of the included trials investigated inspiratory muscle training with a threshold device (i.e. a portable breathing device that increases airflow resistance while inhaling or exhaling). Three trials investigated expiratory muscle training with a threshold device, and one trial investigated breathing exercises. We found benefits with inspiratory muscle training for improving predicted maximal inspiratory pressure, but not for improving measured maximal inspiratory pressure. We did not find any effects for maximal expiratory pressure. Only one study measured quality of life, but it did not find any effects; two trials measured fatigue and also failed to find a difference between the treatment and control groups. Eighteen participants (˜ 10%) dropped out, and no trials reported any serious adverse events. The six trials that were eligible for inclusion in this review were small, so statistical power was low, making analyses less precise. In addition, studies were heterogeneous in terms of the type of respiratory muscle training, dosing/intensity, and the severity of MS. In addition, we could not analyze the effects of training on, for example, cough efficacy, pneumonia, and quality of life, as the included trials did not report on these outcomes even though they are important for patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals. Altogether, this review provides low-quality evidence that resistive inspiratory muscle training improves predicted inspiratory muscle strength in people with MS. We did not find any effects for resistive expiratory muscle training. More high-quality research in respiratory muscle training in MS is needed.
We searched 10 English-language and three Chinese-language databases for published studies in any language, in February 2017. We also searched grey literature databases and websites and contacted experts and authors for eligible studies. Studies had to report information on interventions to prevent pregnancy after a single act of unprotected intercourse. We included 115 randomized controlled trials with 60,479 women in this review. Ninety-two trials were conducted in China. The evidence is up-to-date to February 2017. The studies compared 25 different interventions of different types of emergency contraception. The studies showed the following.
Levonorgestrel and mifepristone were more effective than Yuzpe regimen (estradiol-levonorgestrel combination). Our findings suggest that if 29 women per 1000 become pregnant with Yuzpe, between 11 and 24 women per 1000 will do so with the levonorgestrel, and that if 25 women per 1000 become pregnant with Yuzpe, between one and 10 women per 1000 will do so with mifepristone.
Mid-dose mifepristone (25 mg to 50 mg) was probably more effective than levonorgestrel. Low-dose mifepristone (less than 25 mg) was probably less effective than mid-dose mifepristone, but both were more effective than levonorgestrel (two doses of 0.75 mg). Ulipristal acetate (UPA) was also more effective than levonorgestrel.
Levonorgestrel users had fewer side effects than Yuzpe users, and might be more likely to resume menstruation before the expected date. UPA users were probably more likely to resume menstruation after the expected date. Menstrual delay was probably the main adverse effect of mifepristone and seemed to be dose-related. Cu-IUD may be associated with higher risks of abdominal pain than mifepristone. The quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (observed number of pregnancies) ranged from moderate to high, and for other outcomes ranged from very low to high. The main limitations were risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of methods), imprecision and inconsistency.
The three studies included in our review provide very limited evidence of the effectiveness of methadone for chronic non-cancer pain. We were unable to combine results statistically, and there were too few participants in each study to be confident in their results. No conclusions can be made regarding differences in effectiveness or side effects between methadone and placebo, other opioids, or other treatments.
We wanted to examine the existing evidence for the effect of FPDR, including cardiac arrest, trauma, and acute medical care.
The primary aim of this review was to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during cardiac arrest, trauma, or acute medical care of their loved ones affects the occurrence of PTSD-related symptoms in the relatives.
The secondary aim was to investigate how offering FPDR affects the occurrence of depression, anxiety, and grief in the relatives, and what effect FPDR has on the length of time the medical care is performed, how healthcare professionals are affected, the quality of medical care, and patient's chance of survival. We searched medical databases on 22 March 2022 without any language limits. We checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We included randomized controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of adults who were present during resuscitation of their relative. We included 2 trials (3 papers) involving a total of 595 participants who were between the ages of 19 and 78. One trial involved 15 pre-hospital emergency medical services units in France, investigating FPDR in patients with cardiac arrest. This trial had a one-year evaluation that we included in the review. The other included trial was a small pilot study of FPDR in patients with cardiac arrest or trauma in an emergency department in the UK. There was not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions on the effects of FPDR on any of the outcomes studied. Overall, it appeared that FPDR decreased PTSD, anxiety and depression, and grief; however, as the studies are very few and were at high risk of bias, this effect is very uncertain. One of the included studies also measured duration of patient resuscitation and personal stress in healthcare professionals during FPDR and found no difference between study groups. Our confidence (certainty) in the evidence is very low. There is too little evidence to draw any firm conclusions on the effects of FPDR on psychological outcomes of relatives or any other of the outcomes studied.
We wanted to know if nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or if it is useful in prevention of the disease. We included studies comparing the medicine with placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, usual care, or any other treatments for COVID-19. We addressed equity and wanted to know whether there are certain groups of people for which nirmatrelvir/ritonavir works best or is less effective. We looked at elderly people, socially disadvantaged people with other illnesses (comorbidities), people from low-income and low- to middle-income countries, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.
We evaluated the effects of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in people with COVID-19 regarding:
– people dying;
– whether COVID-19 symptoms got better or worse;
– quality of life;
– unwanted effects of the medicine;
– virus elimination.
For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that investigated nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to prevent or treat COVID-19. People receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir as treatment had to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and be treated in hospital or as outpatients. People receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to prevent an infection had to have a high risk of contracting the disease or had to have had a high-risk contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19.
We summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria as to how reliable the evidence was.
We examined differences with respect to age, level of comorbidity, country according to the World Bank country classification by income level, and ethnicity. We found two studies with 2510 participants that investigated nirmatrelvir/ritonavir compared to placebo or standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19 in people without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at increased risk for progression to severe disease due to a comorbidity or risk factor such as current smoking. Included outpatients were enrolled during the Delta wave, unvaccinated, and had a symptom onset of up to five days before starting treatment. Included inpatients were enrolled during the Omicron wave, mostly unvaccinated, and mildly to moderately affected.
We found 13 ongoing studies that have not yet been completed, and three studies are currently awaiting classification.  For the specific population of unvaccinated, high-risk patients, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may:
– lead to fewer deaths;
– improve patients' condition assessed by need for admission to hospital or death within 28 days;
– reduce serious unwanted events.
For the specific population of unvaccinated, high-risk patients, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir probably:
– has little effect on any unwanted events;
– increases any treatment-related unwanted events (mostly taste disturbance and diarrhoea);
– decreases discontinuation of study medicine due to unwanted events.
Equity aspects
Most study participants were younger than 65 years and of white ethnicity. There was no difference in effectiveness between younger and older participants and participants from different ethnic groups. No subgroups were reported for different levels of comorbidity and World Bank country classification by income level. We are uncertain whether, for the specific population of mildly to moderately affected, high-risk patients, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir:
– leads to fewer deaths; and
– increases virus elimination
Equity aspects
Most study participants were older than 65 years. There was no difference in effectiveness between younger and older participants. No subgroups were reported for different levels of comorbidity, ethnicity, and World Bank country classification by income level.
No subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Our confidence in the evidence is low to moderate for outpatients and very low for inpatients. The studies did not report everything we were interested in, such as quality of life and symptom resolution, and had a highly specific population of people at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. The evidence is up to date to 15 May 2023.
According to this review's living approach, we will update our search every two months. We are making search results and new relevant studies publicly available.
To date, 1651 infants (between eight and 28 days of age) born preterm have been enrolled in 31 studies of late administration of EPO to reduce the use of red blood cell transfusions and to prevent donor exposure.
There were no studies that used darbepoetin. We have not received any funding for this review and we have no conflicts of interest to declare. The risk of receiving red blood transfusion is reduced following initiation of EPO treatment. However, the overall benefit of EPO is reduced as many of these infants had been exposed to donor blood prior to entry into the trials. Treatment with late EPO did not have any important effects on death or common complications of preterm birth, except for trends towards an increased risk for retinopathy of prematurity. Retinopathy of prematurity is a disease of the eye affecting infants born preterm. It is thought to be caused by disorganised growth of retinal blood vessels, which may result in scarring and retinal detachment. Retinopathy of prematurity can be mild and may resolve spontaneously, but it may lead to blindness in serious cases. The study quality varied and important information regarding the random sequence generation and whether the allocation was concealed or not was often missing. Sample sizes were small and long-term outcomes (18 to 24 months of corrected age) were not reported. The quality of the evidence was very low for the outcomes of "use of one or more red blood cell transfusions," "retinopathy of prematurity (all stages or stage not reported)" and for "retinopathy of prematurity (stage ≥ 3)". For the outcomes of "necrotising enterocolitis" and "mortality", the quality of the evidence was moderate.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (trials that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of home-based (which may include digital/telehealth technology) versus supervised centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, in adults with heart disease.
We included 24 trials (3046 participants). We also found nine more studies and 14 trial registrations but they are ongoing or yet to be included in analyses. Most trials were relatively small (median 104 participants, range: 20 to 525). The average age of trial participants ranged from 51.6 to 69 years. Women accounted for only 19% of recruited participants; four trials did not include women. All trials included centre- and home-based models of delivery that required supervision (either in person or remote) by healthcare professionals. Four trials used digital/telehealth technology to support their home-based delivery.
Diagnoses recruited for the trials varied: nine studies included a mixed population with coronary heart disease, six studies in those who had experienced a heart attack/myocardial infarction, four studies following revascularisation, and five in those with heart failure. We found that home- and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are similar in benefits, measured in terms of numbers of deaths, exercise capacity and health-related quality of life. Further data are needed to confirm if these short-term effects of home/digital & telehealth- and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation can be sustained over time. Evidence quality ranged from low (total mortality), to moderate (exercise capacity over 12 months and health-related quality of life). The main reasons for the low assessment of quality was poor study reporting.
In patients with an irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), anticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin, prevent such clots forming and prevent stroke. However, anticoagulant drugs may also cause bleeding in the brain and this harmful effect could outweigh any benefits in patients with a normal heart rhythm. This review identified 11 trials, involving 2487 participants who had had a stroke (and also had a normal heart rhythm), of anticoagulants to prevent further strokes. There was good evidence that anticoagulants could cause serious bleeding, and there was no evidence that, in such patients, anticoagulants were of benefit in the prevention of further strokes. Other trials have shown that, in a person with a normal heart rhythm who has had an ischaemic stroke, antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin are a safe and effective way to reduce the risk of further strokes and heart attacks.
The evidence is current to May 2013. Ten studies were included: four studies used manual lymph drainage with usual care, or combined with exercise or compression versus usual care or education alone (395 participants); three studies examined early versus late start of postoperative shoulder exercises (378 people); two studies used either progressive resistance exercise or restricted activity (358 people); and one study investigated a physiotherapy care plan versus no physiotherapy (65 people). The duration of patient follow-up ranged from two days to two years after the intervention. No firm conclusion can be drawn about the effect of manual lymph drainage in addition to exercise and education on preventing the incidence of lymphoedema. This is because the two included studies found contradicting results. In addition, no firm conclusion can be drawn about manual lymph drainage in combination with other interventions, because only two studies were found that each tested different combinations. One of these studies found that manual lymph drainage combined with exercise lowered the risk of lymphoedema. The other study combined manual lymph drainage with compression, but this study was too small to draw conclusions.
Arm mobility (i.e. reaching upwards over the head) was better after manual lymph drainage than without it, but this improvement lasted only for the first few weeks after breast cancer surgery.
When assessing whether early or late shoulder exercises reduced the likelihood of developing lymphoedema, the studies did not provide a clear result. The likely incidence of lymphoedema ranged from 5% to 27% (early start) compared to 4% to 20% (for delayed start) during the first 6 to 12 months after surgery. Starting shoulder exercises immediately after surgery may improve shoulder mobility in the first month, compared to starting after the first week but no firm conclusions can be drawn and mobility is comparable later on.
Progressive resistance training did not increase the risk of developing lymphoedema compared to restricted activity, on the basis that symptoms were monitored and treated immediately if they occurred.
For all investigated interventions, no firm conclusion can be drawn about their effectiveness in reducing pain or improving quality of life. The evidence was considered to be low quality, except for the evidence on resistance training, which was of moderate quality. This was because many studies had shortcomings in how they were conducted; there were only a small number of studies for each intervention; the results differed between comparable studies; and the groups studied were relatively small.
We searched databases of scientific studies and found 21 studies to include in this review. Studies included 16 randomised trials with 6407 infants, one additional study followed 28330 infants over time and another four were nationwide studies. We assessed the included evidence for how certain we are that the effects are true and would not be altered with the addition of more evidence. In general, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low to moderate but it was very low for some outcomes. IPV-OPV compared to OPV may reduce the cases of paralysis linked to OPV by 54% to 100% without affecting vaccination coverage, the number of serious adverse events, and humoral immunity. However, it may worsen mucosal immunity for some types of polio.
IPV-OPV compared to IPV may make little or no difference on serious adverse events, probably makes little or no difference in the number of persons with protective humoral immunity, may increase neutralising antibodies and probably improves intestinal mucosal immunity of vaccinated people.
Three doses of IPV followed by OPV appears to be no different than two IPV doses followed by OPV on the number of people with protective humoral and gut immunity. The main potential benefit of IPV-OPV, compared to OPV, is that may reduce cases of paralysis linked to OPV. It could be a more affordable option to IPV during the final stages of polio eradication, hence reducing inequities between countries.
We included six trials involving 510 patients for this review. The number of patients included in the trials varied from 40 to 202. All trials had a high risk of bias, that is, the trials may overestimate benefits and underestimate harms. There was no significant difference in risk of death between the two groups. The rate of serious complications was higher in the patients who underwent biliary drainage prior to operation compared with those who underwent surgery directly. The quality of life was not reported in any trial. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups. The costs were not reported in any of the trials. Based on the currently available best evidence, there is no justification for the use of routine drainage of bile before a major operation in patients with obstruction to the flow of bile. Routine biliary drainage should not be funded and may result in litigations. Furthermore, well designed trials with low risk of systematic errors and low risk of random errors (low risk of play of chance) may be necessary.
This review examines the results of published studies which have looked at the effect of using medication following surgery for Crohn's disease as a mean of preventing the return (recurrence) of inflammation. Where possible, the results of studies were combined to compare the results of different treatments. A number of medications appeared to reduce the recurrence of inflammation, including metronidazole, mesalamine, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and infliximab. Given that some of these medications have significant side-effects, the decision to use them requires a careful balancing of the risks and benefits for each individual patient
We included 38 randomised studies published up to October 2013. Trials tested a variety of different interventions and controls. The specific points used, the number of sessions and whether there was continuous stimulation varied. Three studies (393 people) compared acupuncture to a waiting list control. Nineteen studies (1,588 people) compared active acupuncture to sham acupuncture, but only 11 of these studies included long-term follow-up of six months or more. Three studies (253 people) compared acupressure to sham acupressure but none had long-term follow-up. Two trials used laser stimulation and six (634 people) used electrostimulation. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Three studies comparing acupuncture to a waiting list control and reporting long-term abstinence did not show clear evidence of benefit. For acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture, there was weak evidence of a small short-term benefit but not of any long-term benefit. Acupuncture was less effective than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and not shown to be better than counselling. There was limited evidence that acupressure is superior to sham acupressure in the short term but no evidence about long-term effects. In an analysis of the subgroup of trials where the treatment included continuous stimulation, those trials which used continuous acupressure to points on the ear had the largest short-term effect. The evidence from two trials using laser stimulation was inconsistent. The seven trials of electrostimulation do not suggest evidence of benefit compared to sham electrostimulation.
The review did not find consistent evidence that active acupuncture or related techniques increased the number of people who could successfully quit smoking. However, some techniques may be better than doing nothing, at least in the short term, and there is not enough evidence to dismiss the possibility that they might have an effect greater than placebo. They are likely to be less effective than current evidence-based interventions. They are safe when correctly applied.
Perineal hyaluronidase (HAase) injection is a low risk, low cost and potentially effective way to produce relaxation of the perineum that has been proposed to decrease the risk of spontaneous tears or deliberate cuts (episiotomy), without causing other negative effects. The second stage of labour is from when the womb entrance (cervix) is fully open until the delivery of the baby. We wanted to know if perineal HAase injection during the second stage of labour could reduce perineal trauma, episiotomy or perineal pain after vaginal birth, and if there were any unwanted effects. We searched for studies known as randomised controlled trials that evaluated perineal HAase injection compared to a placebo injection or no intervention for reducing perineal trauma and related complications in vaginal birth. The participants in the studies had to be women giving birth to one baby who was their first child and was in the usual position for delivery. We compared and summarised the studies' results, and we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found five studies that involved 743 women giving birth for the first time. The biggest study involved 200 women and the smallest involved 100 women. The studies were conducted in Latin America, North America, Europe and Asia.
The studies showed that perineal HAase injection given during the second stage of labour may result in a lower likelihood of perineal trauma (defined as tears or episiotomy or both) compared with no intervention in women with vaginal delivery (based on 3 studies with 426 participants), but there may be no difference between HAase injection and placebo injection (based on 3 studies with 373 participants). When comparing perineal HAase injection versus placebo injection, 746 out of 1000 women receiving perineal HAase injection may have perineal trauma compared to 794 out of 1000 women receiving placebo injection. When comparing perineal HAase injection versus no intervention, 475 out of 1000 women receiving perineal HAase injection may have perineal trauma compared to 779 out of 1000 women receiving no intervention.
Perineal HAase injection probably reduced perineal swelling 24 hours after vaginal delivery compared to placebo injection (2 studies; 303 participants).
There may be no difference between groups in the likelihood of receiving an episiotomy, nor of having first and second degree perineal lacerations, third and fourth degree perineal lacerations, perineal swelling one hour after vaginal delivery and an Apgar score (measure of newborn health) of less than 7 at five minutes after vaginal delivery.
No side effects (e.g. allergic reactions, bleeding tendencies and local pain from injection) were reported in the studies. Our confidence is limited because the study results varied widely, and the studies involved only small numbers of participants. Some studies did not clearly report how they were conducted, and some were unable to ensure that participants and outcome assessors did not know which participants had received which injection. Further research is likely to change our results. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up-to-date until November 2023.
This review investigated the evidence for the use of probiotic preparations either alone or in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of BV. The current research does not provide conclusive evidence that probiotics are superior to or enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of BV. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of probiotics either before, during or after antibiotic treatment as a means of ensuring successful treatment or reduce recurrence. Larger, well-designed randomized controlled trials with standardized methodologies are needed to confirm the benefits of probiotics in the treatment of BV.
This review found no randomised controlled trials and no evidence to support the use of this procedure in routine practice. More research is needed to establish the role of this procedure in the treatment of this disease.
In this review of 26 randomised controlled trials of 2959 women, the effectiveness and safety of inhaled analgesia as pain relief for women in labour were studied. It was found that inhaled analgesia may help relieve pain during labour but women have to be informed about the side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness and drowsiness.
Inhaled analgesia may help relieve labour pain without adversely increasing operative delivery rates (forceps or vacuum extraction, caesarian section), or affecting neonatal well being. Flurane derivatives were found to be slightly more effective than nitrous oxide for the reduction of pain and for pain relief although nitrous oxide also helped to relieve pain when compared with no treatment.
Women who used nitrous oxide were more likely to experience nausea compared with flurane derivatives. When nitrous oxide was compared with no treatment or placebo, nitrous oxide resulted in side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness and drowsiness.
There was no information for satisfaction with childbirth experience or sense of control in labour in these studies and further research on these two important outcomes would be helpful.
Renal denervation is a treatment that involves destroying renal nerves through a minimally invasive catheter-based technique to treat high blood pressure. We wanted to know if renal denervation would safely reduce blood pressure and improve quality of life in people with resistant hypertension. We searched for studies that compared renal denervation to other treatments or no treatment for who have resistant hypertension. We found 15 studies that involved over 1400 people with resistant hypertension and lasted from 3 to 24 months. So far, we don’t know if using renal denervation can improve risks to the heart, blood vessels and kidneys in people with resistant hypertension. On the other hand, renal denervation might be effective in lowering blood pressure in people with resistant hypertension. More studies that look at factors important to patients such as quality of life are needed. Studies that last longer and have more participants are needed to find out if denervation can lower blood pressure. The review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2020
This review looked at trials of inhaled epinephrine for the treatment of children with croup and is comprised of only eight studies with 225 participants. Of the eight included studies, six were assessed as having low risk of bias and two as unclear risk of bias (based upon assessment of adequate random sequence generation, allocations concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data, and selective reporting). Studies assessed a variety of outcome measures and few studies examined the same outcomes; therefore, most outcomes contained data from a maximum of three studies, and in some cases only single studies.
Compared to no medication, inhaled epinephrine improved croup symptoms in children at 30 minutes following treatment (three studies, 94 children). This treatment effect disappeared two hours after treatment (one study, 20 children). However, children's symptoms did not become worse than prior to treatment. No study measured adverse events.
The evidence is current to July 2013.
When compared with placebo, people taking aripiprazole had fewer relapses, smaller numbers of participants left study early, and needed less additional antipsychotic medications. Insomnia and headache were the most commonly reported side effects, but were not much difference to placebo. Side effects such as akathisia, nausea and weight gain occurred more in the aripripazole group as compared to placebo. There has been a worry with newer antipsychotic medications and their effect on conductance problems in the heart, impaired glucose levels and excessive production of prolactin (which can cause unpleasant breast pain and secretion). On the limited evidence available (due to participants leaving early and fewer studies) aripiprazole appears to have a similar effect to that of placebo. The overall finding on its efficacy in treating schizophrenia is unchanged from those found in the original review.
This review identified 28 randomised controlled trials undertaken in 4287 women. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of study quality varied among trials. Evidence is current to May 2018. Nineteen of the 28 trials acknowledged that they received funding, supplies of equipment, or technical assistance from the pharmaceutical industry and from equipment manufacturers. Moderate- to very low-quality evidence suggests that first- and second-generation approaches were equally effective in the treatment of HMB. Newer (second-generation) treatment approaches were safer in terms of rate of fluid overload, cervical lacerations, and haematometra, with similar rates of uterine perforation. The newer approaches (second-generation ablation) were quicker and were more likely to be done under local (rather than general) anaesthesia compared with first-generation approaches. Most women in both groups were satisfied with results of the procedure. Not enough evidence is available to show which second-generation approaches are superior to others, and information about third-generation approaches is not available for comparison. Evidence ranged from moderate to very low quality. Few studies were blinded, data were limited, and heterogeneity was substantial for some outcomes, leading to downgrading of the quality of evidence.
The benefits and risks of multiple-micronutrient supplementation during lactation are not clear from randomised controlled studies. Key vitamins and minerals, particularly iodine, iron and zinc, are required in small amounts to ensure normal body metabolism, physical growth and development. Nutrient deficiency affects nearly one third of the world’s population, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Breastfeeding mothers need higher levels than usual in order to provide sufficient vitamins and minerals for their own health and that of their babies, particularly for normal functioning and the growth and development of the baby.
Previous studies have assessed supplementation of individual micronutrients. This review looked at the use of multiple-micronutrient supplements for breastfeeding women for improving outcomes for the mother and her baby. We searched for studies on 30 September 2015 and identified two small studies (involving 52 women) for inclusion in this review. The studies were carried out in Brazil and the USA and included women who had a low socioeconomic status. The studies were poorly reported and this lack of information made it difficult to determine whether the studies were at risk of bias. Neither of the studies provided data for any of this review's important outcomes: maternal illness (fever, respiratory infection, diarrhoea), adverse effects of micronutrients within three days of taking them, infant death (defined as a child dying before reaching one year of age).
Similarly, there were no data for any of the other outcomes that we were interested in. For the mother, these outcomes were maternal anaemia, and women's satisfaction. For the baby, these outcomes were micronutrient deficiency; illness episodes (fever, respiratory infection, diarrhoea, other), adverse effects of micronutrients within three days of the woman receiving the supplement. However, one of the included studies reported that multiple-micronutrient supplementation was effective for lactating women recuperating from anaemia.
There is a need for high-quality studies to assess the effectiveness and safety of multiple-micronutrient supplementation for breastfeeding women for improving outcomes for the mother and her baby. Larger studies with longer-term follow-up would improve the quality of studies and provide stronger evidence. Further research should focus on whether multiple-micronutrient supplementation during lactation (compared with no supplementation, a placebo or supplementation with fewer than two micronutrients) is beneficial to the mother and her baby and any associated adverse effects of the intervention. Futher studies should report on important outcomes such as those listed in this review and consider the risks of excess supplementation. Future studies could more precisely assess a variety of multiple-micronutrient combinations and different dosages and look at how these effect outcomes for the mother and her baby.
Pre-eclampsia, also known as toxaemia, is a condition which leads to high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Eclampsia is when a pregnant woman with pre-eclampsia has one or more seizures (fits). Eclampsia is a serious threat to the life of both mother and baby. We identified three randomised trials, involving 397 women with eclampsia who were randomly assigned to treatment with magnesium sulphate or a lytic mixture of chlorpromazine, promethazine and pethidine that lowers blood pressure and is a sedative. Both drugs could be given either by intravenous or intramuscular injection. Although the trials were small and of average quality, the review found that magnesium sulphate was better than lytic cocktail at preventing maternal deaths, further seizures, and breathing problems and coma for the mother. Magnesium sulphate is also relatively cheap and easy to use. The adverse effects of magnesium sulphate come largely from its smooth muscle relaxant activity; respiratory depression is dose dependent and, with monitoring of the woman's clinical condition, uncommon.
Laparoscopic surgery is usually performed through multiple small incisions, but recently it has been shown that it can be done through just one incision. The advocates of this technique claim it is less painful for the patient, and we wanted to find out if:
1) single-incision surgery was associated with less pain and a better cosmetic outcome; and
2) single-incision surgery was as safe as multiple-incision surgery. We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) that compared these two techniques in the treatment of suspected appendicitis. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 11 studies that included 1373 people (689 in the single-incision surgery groups and 684 in the multiple incision surgery groups). We found low-to-moderate-certainty evidence that patients in the single-incision group had a better cosmetic result, with a similar rate of any unwanted side effects compared to the conventional multiple-incision group. Within the single-incision group, there was a higher risk of conversion to multiple incisions or open surgery (which requires a large incision compared to laparoscopic surgery), or making more incisions in order to use additional ports to conduct the operation. There was no difference in the postoperative pain, rate of visceral or vascular injury, wound infection, collection in the abdomen, paralytic ileus (temporary paralysis of the bowel movement), length of hospital stay and time taken to return to normal activities. We have a low-to-moderate level of confidence in our findings. Our low confidence is due to differences in the way the studies measured certain outcomes and the lack of blinding (participants not knowing which type of surgery they had) in the studies, which makes them prone to performance bias (participants or surgeons acting differently because they know the group each participant is in). The evidence is up to date at 20 January 2024.
Study characteristics: We included sixteen randomised controlled trials (1063 participants) comparing Tong-xin-luo capsules plus conventional treatment with placebo plus/or conventional treatment (literature search date: though June 2014). All studies were undertaken in China. The sample size was from 50 to 178 and the duration of follow-up ranged from three months to two years.
Key results: We found that Tong-xin-luo may possibly reduce the risk of narrowing of a blood vessel detected by angiography, cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, angina and heart failure) and use of repeat procedure. Adverse events were seldom reported.
Quality of evidence: Because of high risk of bias for fifteen studies, imprecision and possible publication bias, the quality of evidence was low or very low for all study outcomes.
This Cochrane Review summarises evidence from 14 randomised controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of scopolamine for motion sickness. The results show that scopolamine is more effective than placebo and scopolamine-like derivatives in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness. However, scopolamine was not shown to be superior to antihistamines and combinations of scopolamine and ephedrine. Scopolamine was less likely to cause drowsiness, blurred vision or dizziness when compared to these other agents.
This review looked at whether these medicines could help patients with problems caused by cancer treatments. Eight studies with a total of 664 participants were included in this review. Three studied adverse effects of radiotherapy, three studied adverse effects of chemotherapy and two studied menopausal symptoms associated with breast cancer treatment. Two studies with low risk of bias demonstrated benefit: one with 254 participants demonstrated benefits from calendula ointment in the prevention of radiotherapy-induced dermatitis, and another with 32 participants demonstrated benefits from Traumeel S (a complex homeopathic medicine) over placebo as a mouthwash for chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. These trials need replicating. Two other studies reported positive results, although the risk of bias was unclear, and four further studies reported negative results. The homeopathic medicines used in all eight studies did not seem to cause any serious adverse effects or interact with conventional treatment. No cancer treatments were modified or stopped because of the homeopathic interventions.
We searched medical databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of treatments for swallowing difficulties in hereditary ataxia. Well performed RCTs provide the best quality evidence. Quasi-randomised trials allocate participants to treatment using methods that are not completely random, such as by date of birth, case record number, or day of the week. No studies met these pre-specified inclusion criteria. We found no RCTs or quasi-RCTs of treatment for swallowing difficulties in hereditary ataxia. The absence of high quality studies examining the efficacy of treatments for dysphagia in these disorders means than no conclusions can be drawn on the most appropriate treatment of dysphagia and highlights the urgent need for well controlled trials in the field.
The evidence is current to September 2015.
This review found two trials from the US, two from Africa, one from the Philippines, and another from Finland that involved 113,044 children less than two years of age. In these studies, PCV was able to prevent overwhelming pneumococcal blood infection and pneumonia.
We found six randomised controlled trials comparing a gradient, swim-up or wash technique, in a total of 485 couples undergoing IUI. The evidence is current to March 2019. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in pregnancy outcomes between the three sperm preparation techniques for subfertile couples undergoing IUI. No studies reported on live birth rates. Considering the quality of evidence (very low), we are uncertain whether there was a difference between clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) for swim-up versus a gradient technique. The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a gradient technique is assumed to be 24%, the chance of pregnancy after using the swim-up technique is between 14% and 30%. We are uncertain whether there was a difference between ongoing pregnancy rates per couple, multiple pregnancy rates (MPR) per couple or miscarriage rates (MR) per couple when comparing a swim-up versus gradient technique. The quality of the evidence for these outcomes was very low. No studies reported on ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. Considering the quality of evidence (very low), we are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates after a swim-up technique versus wash and centrifugation. The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a wash technique is assumed to be 38%, the chance of pregnancy after using the swim-up technique is between 9% and 41%. Considering the very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between multiple pregnancy rates between swim-up technique versus wash technique. Miscarriage rate was only reported by one study: no miscarriages were reported in either treatment arm. No studies reported on ongoing pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. Considering the quality of evidence (very low), we are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates after a gradient versus wash and centrifugation technique. The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a wash technique is assumed to be 13%, the chance of pregnancy after using the gradient technique is between 8% and 46%. Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between multiple pregnancy rates per couple between the treatment groups. Considering the quality of evidence, we are also uncertain whether there was a difference between miscarriage rates per couple between the treatment groups. No studies reported on ongoing pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. The quality of the evidence was very low. The main limitations were (unclear) risk of bias, signs of imprecision (small number of studies/participants included) and inconsistency in results among studies.
We found 12 randomised controlled trials (enrolling 2877 infants in total). The trials were generally of good methodological quality. These trials did not provide strong or consistent evidence that glutamine supplementation affected the risk of death, serious infection or bowel disease, or longer term development. Glutamine supplementation is not likely to be beneficial for preterm infants.
We wanted to find out if a person's sex or gender influences post-transplant outcomes such as rejection of the kidney (caused by the body's immune system attacking the transplanted kidney), loss of the transplanted kidney, development of cancer, or death. We searched the medical literature primarily for cohort studies (studies that follow people over a period of time), case-control studies (studies comparing two groups of people with and without our specific outcomes) and cross-sectional studies (data collected on many individuals at a single point in time) that focused on how sex and gender impact on graft survival, death, cancer incidence and rejection after kidney and simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation. We did not include studies that did not define sex and gender clearly. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as study methods and size. We found 53 studies with 2,940,273 patients, with the number ranging from 59 to 407,963, and of these, 46% were female and 54% male. Sixteen studies were conducted in the Americas, 12 in Europe, 11 in the Western Pacific, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, three in Africa, two in Southeast Asia and five across multiple regions. Compared to males, being female may make little or no difference to the loss of the transplanted kidney, death, those diagnosed with cancer, or the incidence of either acute or chronic rejection. We found only one study that focused on recipient gender and, therefore, cannot make any conclusions on the effect of gender on outcomes following kidney transplantation. Our confidence in the evidence is low because most studies did not define sex or gender separately, and the terms were often used interchangeably. Studies were conducted over a very wide time frame (from 1990 to 2023), and definitions, particularly for acute rejection, have changed over this 30-year period. We searched databases up until 12 April 2023.
In February 2014, we updated the computer searches for studies of vasectomy methods. For the initial review, we also looked at reference lists of articles and book chapters. We included randomized controlled trials in any language.
We found six studies. One trial compared closing the vas with clips versus the usual cutting of the vas. The groups did not differ in reaching a low sperm count or in side effects. Three trials looked at flushing fluids through the vas: two compared vasectomy with water flushing versus vasectomy alone, and one compared using water versus euflavine (which kills sperm). None found a difference between the groups in time to low sperm count. However, one trial found that the usual number of ejaculations before low sperm count was lower with euflavine than with water. One trial that compared vasectomy with and without fascial interposition was a high-quality large study. The fascial interposition group was less likely to have vasectomy failure. However, the surgery was more difficult. Side effects were about the same in the two groups. Lastly, one trial looked at a device placed into the vas versus vasectomy without a scalpel. The intra-vas device did not work as well for reaching a low sperm count but more men liked the method.
Most of the studies that looked at vasectomy methods were small, not done well, or had poor reports. Therefore, we cannot say if the methods work well, are safe or are liked by men. Vasectomy with fascial interposition worked better than simply cutting and tying the vas, but the surgery was more difficult. More and better research is needed on vasectomy methods.
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing different phototherapies, or comparing phototherapy with other treatments or a placebo (sham treatment), for foot ulcers in adults with diabetes in October 2016. We included eight trials (316 participants). Most studies were undertaken in clinics or hospitals and had small numbers of participants (14 to 84). The average age in the included studies was from 53 to 68 years, and the ratio of females to males was 0.46 to 1.88. The included studies compared phototherapy with placebo or no phototherapy, on top of usual care (usual care could include treatments such as dressings, antibiotics, or wound cleaning). Treatment times ranged from 15 days to 20 weeks. The results suggested that phototherapy, when compared to no phototherapy or a placebo, may increase the proportion of wounds completely healed during follow-up and reduce wound size. However, as the included studies involved small numbers of participants and had drawbacks in study methods, our confidence in these results is limited. We did not find sufficient evidence that the potential harms or incidence of amputations differed between the phototherapy group and the no phototherapy/placebo group. We judged the quality of the evidence to be low due to a lack of data and risk of the study results being biased. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm the benefits and harms of phototherapy.
This plain language summary is up to date as of 26 October 2016.
Two good quality randomized controlled trials involving 754 women were identified. Rapid negative pressure application reduced the duration of the procedure without any evidence of differences in outcomes for the mother or infant. Rapid method of negative pressure application should be recommended for vacuum extraction assisted vaginal delivery.
We did not find substantial differences between antidepressants and benzodiazepines in terms of efficacy and tolerability. There was not enough information to compare any differences in adverse effects. However, our findings are limited in the following ways: few studies contributed to each analysis, some studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, and only short-term outcomes were assessed. The quality of the available evidence was mainly low, meaning that further research would be very likely to have an important impact on these results. Studies with larger sample sizes and fewer risks of bias should be carried out, with head-to-head comparisons. Longer-term outcomes need to be addressed to establish whether the effect is transient or durable. Trials should better report any harms experienced by participants during the trial. In addition, a network meta-analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder will likely shed further light on this compelling issue, also being able to provide more information with regard to comparative efficacy.
We searched the medical literature up to 26 January 2017. All randomised trials that compare two different antibiotics, or variations in dosing of a single antibiotic for treatment of CDI were included. Trials comparing antibiotic to placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) or no treatment were sought but, save for one poor quality placebo-controlled trial, none were found. Trials that compared antibiotics to a non-antibiotic treatment were not included.
Results
Twenty-two studies (total 3215 participants) were included. The majority of studies enrolled participants with mild to moderate CDI who could tolerate oral antibiotics. Sixteen of the included studies excluded participants with severe CDI and few participants with severe CDI were included in the other studies. Twelve different antibiotics were assessed. Most of the studies compared vancomycin or metronidazole with other antibiotics. One small study compared vancomycin to placebo (e.g. sugar pill). There were no other studies that compared antibiotic treatment to a placebo or a no treatment control group. Seventeen of the 22 included studies had quality issues. In four studies, vancomycin was found to be superior to metronidazole for achieving sustained symptomatic cure (defined as resolution of diarrhoea and no recurrence of CDI). We rated the quality of the evidence supporting this finding as moderate. A new antibiotic, fidaxomicin, was, in two large studies, found to be superior to vancomycin. The quality of the evidence supporting this finding was moderate. It should be noted that the differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not too great and that metronidazole is far less expensive than either vancomycin and fidaxomicin. A pooled analysis of two small studies suggests that teicoplanin may be more effective than vancomycin for achieving symptomatic cure. The quality of the evidence supporting this finding was very low. The quality of the evidence for the other seven antibiotics in this review was very poor because the studies were very small, and many patients dropped out of these studies before completion. One hundred and forty deaths were reported in the studies, all of which were attributed to participants preexisting health problems. The only side effects attributed to antibiotics were rare nausea and temporary elevation of liver enzymes. Recent cost data (July 2016) for a 10 day course of treatment shows that metronidazole 500 mg is the least expensive antibiotic with a cost of USD 13. Vancomycin 125 mg costs USD 1779 compared to fidaxomicin 200 mg at USD 3453.83 or more and teicoplanin at approximately USD 83.67.
Conclusion
No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in severe CDI as most studies excluded these patients. The lack of any 'no treatment' control studies does not allow for any conclusions regarding the need for antibiotic treatment in patients with mild CDI beyond withdrawal of the antibiotic that caused CDI. Nonetheless, moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin. The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not too large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost compared to the other antibiotics. The quality of evidence for teicoplanin is very low. Larger studies are needed to determine if teicoplanin performs as well as the other antibiotics. A trial comparing the two cheapest antibiotics, metronidazole and teicoplanin would be of interest.
We searched the literature for robust evaluations of the effectiveness of organisational interventions in promoting EBP in nursing. We included one study from the USA which involved one hospital and for which the number of nurses was not reported. The study evaluated the effects of a standardised evidence-based nursing procedure on improved nursing care for patients at risk of developing healthcare-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs), as measured by the HAPU rate. If a patient's admission Braden score was lower than or equal to 18, nurses were authorised to initiate a prevention pressure ulcer care bundle, without a physician order. The Braden scale is a tool used to assess a patient's risk of developing pressure ulcers. An adult with a score below or equal to 18 is considered to have a high risk for developing a pressure ulcer.
Re-analysis of the HAPU data, as an interrupted time series, was suggestive of a trend in rates prior to intervention and, if that trend was assumed to be real, there was no evidence of an intervention effect at three months (mean rate per quarter 0.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 3.3; P = 0.457). Given the small percentages post intervention it was not statistically possible to extrapolate effects beyond three months.
Considering the importance placed on organisational change in promoting EBP in nursing, it is surprising that eight years after the previous empty Cochrane review was published, appropriately evaluated organisational infrastructure interventions are still lacking. If policy-makers and healthcare organisations wish to promote evidence-based nursing at an organisational level successfully, they must ensure the funding and conduct of well-designed studies to generate evidence to guide policy.
We identified one trial comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with mild acute pancreatitis. Out of the 50 participants included in this trial, 25 underwent early laparoscopic cholecystectomy while the remaining 25 underwent delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All 50 participants were alive at the end of the trial. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants who developed complications. Health-related quality of life was not reported in this trial. There were no conversions to open cholecystectomy in either group. The total hospital stay was shorter by approximately two days in the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group than in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. The trial did not report the number of work-days lost or the costs. We did not identify any trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy after severe acute pancreatitis. Based on the observations in the one trial included in this review, there appears to be no evidence of increased risk of complications after early laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy may shorten the total hospital stay in people with mild acute pancreatitis. If appropriate facilities and expertise are available, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears preferable to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in people with mild acute pancreatitis. There is currently no evidence to support or refute early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with severe acute pancreatitis. Further well-designed randomised controlled trials are necessary in people with mild acute pancreatitis and severe acute pancreatitis. The one trial identified is at high risk of bias, i.e. there was potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way that the study was designed and conducted.
This review found only one small trial of 39 participants. Cholesterol-reducing drugs did not reduce the risk of delayed brain injury and did not significantly improve participants' degree of recovery. There were no significant differences in adverse events. This review is based on one small trial and no reliable conclusions can be drawn at present.
This review included 29 studies involving 23019 participants. When we compared the effects of dipyridamole (alone or together with aspirin) with aspirin alone there was no evidence of an effect on death from vascular causes. When we compared the effects on the occurrence of vascular events (strokes, heart attacks, and deaths from vascular diseases) the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole had an advantage over aspirin alone. This result holds particularly true for patients with ischaemic stroke.
We wanted to find out how outcomes differed for women or their babies who received a midwife continuity of care model compared to other models of care.
Our main outcomes were: spontaneous vaginal birth, caesarean section, regional anaesthesia (spinal or epidural block to numb the lower part of the body), intact perineum (the area between the anus and the vulva), fetal loss after 24 weeks gestation, preterm birth, and neonatal death.
We also looked at a range of other outcomes, including women’s experience and cost. We searched for studies that compared midwife continuity of care models with other models of care for pregnant women. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and size. We found 17 studies involving 18,533 women in Australia, Canada, China, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.
Many of these studies largely focused on women with a lower risk of complications at the start of pregnancy, or those drawn from a specific geographical location. Midwives continued to provide midwifery care in collaboration with specialist and obstetric teams if women developed complications in pregnancy, birth, and postpartum. Women or their babies who received midwife continuity of care models compared to those receiving other models of care were less likely to experience a caesarean section or instrumental vaginal delivery, and may be less likely to experience an episiotomy. They were more likely to experience a spontaneous vaginal birth.
Midwife continuity care models probably make little or no difference to the likelihood of having an intact perineum, and may have little or no impact on the likelihood of preterm birth.
We are uncertain about the effect of midwife continuity of care models on regional anaesthesia, fetal loss after 24 weeks' gestation, and neonatal death.
Women who experienced care from midwife continuity of care models reported more positive experiences during pregnancy, labour, and postpartum. Additionally, there were cost savings in the antenatal and intrapartum period. Our confidence in these findings varies and further evidence may change our results. For instance, it is not always clear if the people assessing the outcomes knew which type of care the women received. The evidence for fetal loss after 24 weeks' gestation and neonatal death is based on a very small number of cases and there are not enough studies to be certain about some results. We lack data on important aspects like maternal health status after birth, neonatal readmissions, or infant health status.
Few studies included a specific focus on women at high risk of complications, and none focused on women from disadvantaged backgrounds, indicating a need for future research in these areas. This highlights the need for more comprehensive and diverse studies to strengthen our understanding and confidence in these findings, particularly in varied populations and across different healthcare settings.
Future research should focus on the impact on women with social risk factors, and those with medical complications, and understanding the implementation and scaling up of midwife continuity of care models, with emphasis on low- and middle-income countries. This is an update of our previous review. We included evidence up to 17 August 2022.
This review found that a single subcutaneous dose was effective in relieving migraine headache pain and associated symptoms of nausea, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound. Pain was reduced from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in almost 6 in 10 people (59%) taking sumatriptan 6 mg, compared with about 1 in 7 (15%) taking placebo, and reduced from moderate or severe to no worse than mild pain by two hours in almost 8 in 10 people (79%) taking sumatriptan compared with about 3 in 10 (31%) taking placebo. Subcutaneous sumatriptan was fast-acting, and the majority of people experiencing pain relief had done so by one hour. About 3 in 10 (31%) people had freedom from pain at two hours which was sustained during the 24 hours postdose without the use of rescue medication, compared with about 1 in 7 (15%) with placebo. In addition to relieving headache pain, sumatriptan also relieved symptoms of nausea and sensitivity to light and sound by two hours in about half of those who took it, compared with about one-third of those taking placebo. Adverse events, most of which were of short duration and mild or moderate in severity, were more frequent with sumatriptan than with placebo.
Three studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. It was not possible to pool the data from the 3 included studies, either because of the different lengths of treatment or choice of different control treatments, or because the outcome measures were not comparable. Two significant results were found but there were no statistically significant differences between validation and social contact or between validation and usual therapy. There were no assessments of carers. All in all there is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to allow any conclusion about the efficacy of validation therapy for people with dementia or cognitive impairment.
This review aimed to find out whether CBT is effective for CBT, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with other treatments, and whether it is more effective than other treatments used for CFS. The review included 15 studies, with a total of 1043 CFS participants. The review showed that people attending for CBT were more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than people who received usual care or were on a waiting list for therapy, with 40% of people in the CBT group showing clinical improvement, in contrast with 26% in usual care. At follow-up, 1-7 months after treatment ended, people who had completed their course of CBT continued to have lower fatigue levels, but when including people who had dropped out of treatment, there was no difference between CBT and usual care. The review also compared CBT against other types of psychological therapy, including relaxation techniques, counselling and support/education, and found that people attending for CBT was more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than those attending for other psychological therapies. Physical functioning, depression, anxiety and psychological distress symptoms were also more reduced when compared with other psychological therapies. However at follow-up, the results were inconsistent and the studies did not fit well together, making it difficult to draw any conclusions. Very few studies reported on the acceptability of CBT and no studies examined side effects. Only two studies compared the effectiveness of CBT against other treatments, both exercise therapy, and just one study compared a combination of CBT and other treatments with usual care. More studies should be carried out to establish whether CBT is more helpful than other treatments for CFS, and whether CBT in combination with other treatments is more helpful than single treatment approaches.
We identified 13 studies up to June 2013. These studies included 603 participants who had had a stroke. Twelve of the studies investigated the effect of different types of training or exercise: six studies (276 participants) investigated repetitive sit-to-stand training, four studies (264 participants) investigated an exercise training programme that included sit-to-stand training, one study (12 participants) included a training programme (sitting training) aiming to improve sit-to-stand, and one study (42 participants) investigated feedback (information about the symmetry of weight taken through the feet) during sit-to-stand. One of the studies investigated the effect of starting posture for sit-to-stand: this study (nine participants) compared sit-to-stand with a cane and without a cane. This study measured people during three tests of rising to stand with a cane, and three tests of rising to stand without a cane; there was no training period. Combining the results of these studies provides us with evidence that training or exercises aiming to improve sit-to-stand performance have beneficial effects compared with usual care, no treatment or an alternative intervention: people who participated in training or exercises got faster at rising to stand and increased the amount of weight that they took through the leg affected by the stroke. There was also some evidence that these beneficial effects were still present several months after the end of training. Sit-to-stand training did not seem to affect the number of falls that people had, although the evidence was of poor quality. There was not enough evidence to say what the ideal amount of training or exercise was, but the results do suggest that training three times a week for two to three weeks may be enough to have a beneficial effect. We did not find any evidence of effects on outcomes other than time to sit-to-stand or the weight through the affected leg, or any evidence that the length of the training programme or the time since the participants had their stroke made any difference to outcomes. The studies that we found mainly included people who were able to walk and sit-to-stand independently at the start of the study, so these results are only relevant to this group of people. In other words, these results are not relevant to people who are unable to sit-to-stand independently and further research is needed to investigate the effect of sit-to-stand training for these people. The available studies suggest that effective interventions can either be specific repetitive training of sit-to-stand or exercise programmes that include repetitive sit-to-stand. The evidence is insufficient to reach conclusions relating to the duration or intensity of training. We found insufficient evidence relating to our primary outcome of ability to sit-to-stand independently to reach any generalisable conclusions. However, we found moderate quality evidence, from a relatively low number of small studies, that interventions to improve sit-to-stand may have a beneficial effect on the speed of rising to stand and the weight taken through the affected leg. We found insufficient evidence to reach any conclusions about the effect of sit-to-stand training on other outcomes. We recommend large clinical trials to confirm the results of this review, and to investigate the effects of different numbers of repetitions and durations of therapy. Future studies should include a measure of functional ability, and should measure long-term outcomes as well as outcomes straight after therapy.
In this review we were interested in whether giving babies sugar-based solutions to taste when the needle breaks the skin will help reduce their pain. We found 14 separate studies that had asked this question. However, the differences between the studies were often too great to let us combine their findings. Overall, the studies show that different types of sugar-based solutions were effective but we were not able to confidently assert that there is strong evidence for this treatment in reducing pain. We did find some evidence that babies may not cry for as long if given sugar-based solutions. This review is broadly in agreement with two other reviews, one asking this question in younger children, and one in older children. There is a need for better studies in this field.
We included 38 studies that involved 7924 young people (aged 5 to 16 years) among whom a variety of dental sealants was used to prevent tooth decay. Young people in the studies represented the general population.
The review includes studies available from a search of the literature up to 3 August 2016. We assessed all studies as being at high risk of bias because the dental professionals who are measuring the outcomes can see whether or not sealant has been used. Fifteen studies compared resin-based sealants to no sealants and found that children who had sealant applied to their back teeth were less likely to have tooth decay in their back teeth than children with no sealant. We were able to combine data from seven of these studies (including two published since 2010), which involved children who were aged from 5 to 10 years when the sealants were applied. This showed that if 40% of back teeth develop decay over 24 months, using sealant reduces this to 6%. Similar benefits for resin-based sealants were shown up to four years. The effect appeared to persist when measured up to nine years, but there was less evidence.
Results were inconclusive when glass ionomer-based sealant was compared with no sealant and when one type of sealant material was compared with another.
Four studies assessed possible problems from using sealants; none were reported. We found moderate-quality evidence that resin-based sealant is more effective than no sealant for preventing tooth decay, reducing it by between 11% and 51% more than in children without sealant (measured two years after application). 'Moderate quality' means we are reasonably certain of this finding, although it is possible that future research could change it. Most of the studies included in this analysis were carried out in the 1970s. We are not able to draw conclusions about the other comparisons included in our review as the available evidence is very low quality. More studies with long follow-up times are needed.
Endometriosis is a disease characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue (the lining of the womb) outside the cavity of the womb. Many women with the disease suffer from menstrual pain and some suffer from infertility. Infertile women with endometriosis are often treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) but have a lower chance of becoming pregnant compared to women who are infertile with blocked tubes. It has been suggested that giving GnRH agonists before IVF or ICSI could increase the chances of pregnancy. We have reviewed the literature and found that treating women for three to six months with GnRH agonists before IVF or ICSI increases the odds of clinical pregnancy four-fold. However, at present there is no information on the effect of this treatment on the incidence of ectopic pregnancy, multiple pregnancies or complications arising for the women or their offspring.
We identified five randomised clinical studies with 1601 children comparing two dosing schedules. Participants were aged 12 years or younger with AOM. The primary outcome was clinical cure rate in terms of resolution of otalgia and fever at the end of antibiotic therapy (days seven to 15). The secondary outcomes were clinical cure rate in terms of middle ear effusion during therapy, clinical cure rate post-treatment (one to three months) in terms of resolution of middle ear infection, AOM complications and adverse events to medication. The results showed that treating acute middle ear infection with either once/twice daily or three times daily amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, has the same results using our outcome measures, including adverse events such as diarrhoea and skin reactions.
The evidence is current to March 2013.
We looked at the benefits and possible harms of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with AF. We searched for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation to no exercise in people with AF. We wanted to know the effects on death, serious unwanted effects, and various measures of AF severity and patient well-being. We included 20 studies involving a total of 2039 people with AF. In total, there were 101 deaths and 28 serious unwanted effects. There was not enough evidence to know whether exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation reduces the risk of death or serious unwanted effects. Exercise-based rehabilitation likely reduces AF recurrence, AF symptoms, and probably improves the mental aspects of quality of life. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may also reduce AF symptom severity and may improve exercise capacity. Our confidence in the overall findings of the review is limited because it is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting; reporting of results was incomplete; outcomes varied across studies; and the number of people included in the studies was relatively small. The evidence is current to March 2024.
We include 24 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 789 people with acne scars (from searches up to November 2015). Twenty-one RCTs (706 people) enrolled both men and women, three RCTs (75 people) enrolled only women and one RCT (eight people) enrolled only men. Most of the studies we included (21 RCTs with 744 people) enrolled people with atrophic acne scars. One RCT enrolled 20 individuals with mixed atrophic and hypertrophic acne scars. There is insufficient evidence from trials to support fractional laser for treatment of acne. However, this management approach is adopted by some in clinical practice for the treatment of acne scarring.
For our outcome 'Participant-reported scar improvement' fractional laser was more effective in producing scar improvement change than non-fractional non-ablative laser. Fractional radiofrequency showed similar scar improvement to fractional laser. Chemical peeling showed similar scar improvement to both fractional laser and skin needling. Combined chemical peeling with skin needling showed similar scar improvement to fractional laser and to deep chemical peeling. Injectable fillers provided better scar improvement compared to placebo.
Our outcome ‘Serious adverse effects’ was reported in one study, showing that chemical peeling was not tolerable in 16% of those taking part. Other outcomes, ‘Participant-reported' and 'Investigator-assessed' adverse events in the short term (less than 24 weeks), were more or less acceptable by those taking part and by investigators and did not reveal a big difference between the studied interventions.
Four out of six of our comparisons were completely inconclusive and they were of very low-quality evidence. There is a lack of studies that establish efficacy of treatments compared to placebo or sham interventions, and it is possible that finding no evidence of difference between two active treatments could mean that neither is very useful.
We did not identify any trials that examined treatment for acne scars on the back.
The results of this review do not support the first-line use of any intervention in the treatment of acne scars, and no studies provided evidence to confirm that any short-term benefit will translate to long-term effects. We rated the quality of the evidence for several outcomes as very low to moderate. The lower quality evidence for treatments was mostly because there were few people in the studies, making the results less precise, and there was a lack of blinding (people knew the treatment they were receiving).
Future studies should consider adopting patient-reported outcomes as a primary measure. There should be a set of core outcome measures reported in all RCTs for treating acne scars, and outcomes should be evaluated several months after the treatment has been done. Lack of reporting of serious side effects was one of the research gaps found in this review.
This Cochrane Review is current to June 2021 and includes 12 studies with a total of 1317 participants. The studies were conducted in nine countries. The average participant age in the included studies was 82 years old; 73% of the participants were women. Six trials reported funding by government and research institutions, and one study reported funding from a commercial advocacy group. - Mobility improved by 8% (4% higher to 13% higher) upon completion of the training period (12 studies, 1151 participants). People with no mobility training scored 4.69 points (out of 12 on the Short Physical Performance Battery scale; a higher score indicates better mobility). People with mobility training scored 5.69 points.
- Function improved by 9% (3% higher to 14% higher) upon completion of the training period (9 studies, 916 participants). People with no mobility training scored 86.1 points (out of 100 on the Barthel Index; a higher score indicates better functioning). People with mobility training scored 94.68 points.
- Unwanted or harmful effects of the training decreased by 19% (9% fewer to 26% fewer) (2 studies, 225 participants). If 1000 people were followed over 1 year, 771 people with no mobility training would experience unwanted or harmful effects, whereas 562 people with mobility training would experience unwanted or harmful effects.
- Admissions to nursing care facilities decreased by 4% (8% more to 12% fewer) (1 study, 241 participants). If 1000 people were followed over 1 year, 248 people with no mobility training would have an admission to a nursing care facility, whereas 208 people with mobility training would have an admission to a nursing care facility.
- Falls increased by 1% (12% more to 7% fewer) (2 studies, 425 participants). If 1000 people were followed over 1 year, 573 people with no mobility training would have a fall, whereas 584 people with mobility training would have a fall.
- Death rate increased by 1% (6% more to 2% fewer) (6 studies, 747 participants). If 1000 people were followed over 1 year, 51 people with no mobility training would die, whereas 59 people with mobility training would die. In people with frailty, high-certainty evidence shows mobility training improves mobility. Moderate-certainty evidence shows mobility training is likely to improve function. Mobility training may result in little to no difference to the number of admissions to nursing care facilities (low-certainty evidence), number of people who fall (low-certainty evidence), and the death rate (moderate-certainty evidence). Unwanted or harmful effects of the training were not well reported, and where reported, the overall evidence was of very low certainty.
A group of experts has developed a checklist and flow diagram called the CONSORT Statement. The checklist is designed to help authors in the reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review aims to determine whether the CONSORT Statement has made a difference to the completeness of reporting of RCTs. Reporting of RCTs published in journals that encourage authors to use the CONSORT Statement with those that do not is compared. We found that some items in the CONSORT Statement were fully reported more often when journals encouraged the use of CONSORT. While the majority of items are reported more often when journals endorse CONSORT, the data only showed a statistically significant improvement in reporting for five of 27 items. No items suggest that CONSORT decreases the completeness of reporting of RCTs published in medical journals.
None of the evaluations included in this review used experimental designs, and their methodological approaches were mostly poorly described and variable when they were described. Furthermore, evaluations assessed the completeness of reporting of RCTs within a wide range of medical fields and in journals with a wide variation in the enforcement of CONSORT endorsement. Our results do have some limitations, but given the number of included evaluations and the number of assessed RCTs, we conclude that while most RCTs are incompletely reported, the CONSORT Statement beneficially influences their reporting quality.
In this updated review we set out to estimate how well morphine worked, how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were – for example, whether they were so severe that participants stopped taking their oral morphine.
We found 62 studies with 4241 participants. The studies were often small, compared many different preparations, and used different study designs. This made it difficult to work out whether any one tablet or preparation of oral morphine was better than any other. There did not seem to be much difference between them. More than 9 in 10 participants had pain that went from moderate or severe before taking morphine to pain that was no worse than mild when taking morphine. More than 6 in 10 participants were very satisfied with the morphine treatment, or considered the result to be very good or excellent. Only about 1 person in 20 stopped taking morphine because of side effects. Morphine is associated with some unwanted effects, mainly constipation, and nausea and vomiting. At one level these are good results. On another level, the quality of studies is generally poor and we could wish for more consistency in study design, and especially in study reporting, which should include the outcome of pain reduced to tolerable levels – no worse than mild pain – so that people with cancer are not bothered by pain.
This review sought evidence to compare other types of drugs with anticholinergics. Only a few, small-scale randomised trials were found, many testing drugs that are no longer used clinically. The review found inadequate evidence to assess whether or not available alternative drugs are better or worse than anticholinergics in the management of people with symptoms of overactive bladder syndrome.
We found some evidence from seven small trials of generally poor quality, that hearing may be improved in people with ISSHL and possibly that tinnitus may also be improved. This may only be true if HBOT is used within two weeks of the onset of problems and there is no evidence that HBOT can help people who have been deaf for some months. Further research is needed.
This updated review randomly assigned 247 preterm infants (in five trials), to an intervention of cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress. The control babies received routine care in an air heated incubator. One trial had three-arms, including cot-nursing in a room heated with a manually controlled space heater. In the included trials infants in the incubator groups were nursed naked apart from wearing a nappy, except in one trial in which the infants also wore a cotton jacket and booties. Three comparisons were undertaken: the overall comparison of cot-nursing versus incubator care, and two subgroup comparisons: cot-nursing with heated water-filled mattress versus incubator care, and cot-nursing using warming of the nursery versus incubator care. The results of the review showed no evidence of effect of cot-nursing versus incubator care on weight gain in the overall analysis, or in the subgroup analysis comparing cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress with incubator care. However, cot-nursing with warming of the nursery during week one when compared to incubator care revealed poorer weight gain. The primary outcomes related to temperature control (mean body temperature and episodes of cold stress) indicated on overall analysis no effect of cot-nursing compared to incubator care. Episodes of hyperthermia in the cot-nursing group were reported more frequently in one trial. The secondary outcomes of oxygen consumption, breast feeding at hospital discharge, episodes of nosocomial sepsis, maternal perceptions of infant's condition, maternal stress and anxiety and death prior to hospital discharge revealed there was no effect of cot-nursing compared to incubator care. There was, however, a strong trend towards less death prior to hospital discharge. This was largely related to the results were obtained from the trials undertaken in Turkey and Ethiopia and thus may not be applicable to neonatal nurseries in developed countries. Nevertheless the implications of these findings deserve consideration, particularly in the context of a developing country.
We searched for evidence on 28 May 2021 and identified two studies that compared an early warning system with standard care. One study was a single-centre study involving 700 women and the second was a stepped-wedge cluster trial (multiple centres grouped into 'clusters') involving 536,233 women. Different clusters of centres introduced the tool over time until all centres were using the tool. Both studies were carried out in low-resource healthcare settings. The tools were called the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device. Risk of bias in the two studies was low or unclear.
We found that the tools probably do not reduce maternal death. Women may have less serious bleeding (or haemorrhage) when an early warning tool is used. This finding was supported by low-certainty evidence. We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to a potentially life-threatening body response to infection (sepsis), to blood pressure with swelling, protein in the urine and convulsions (eclampsia), to a serious illness in pregnancy that affects the blood and the way the liver works (HELLP), or being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Use of the tools probably reduces the time a woman stays in hospital (moderate-certainty evidence). We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to the death of the baby in the first month after birth (neonatal death). This finding was supported by low-certainty evidence. Neither of the two included studies reported cost outcomes. Use of early warning tools for women in maternity care in low-resource settings may reduce serious bleeding and probably reduces the number of days a woman stays in the hospital but may not reduce maternal or infant deaths. More studies are required on the different early warning systems in low-resource settings. Studies are also needed in middle- and high-resource settings, and in high- and low-risk pregnant women.
Several epidemiological studies of critically ill patients highlight a direct association between low levels of calcium (hypocalcemia) and mortality, though whether this association is causal is unknown. On the other hand, despite prior studies detailing associations between hypocalcemia and poor outcome, there is evidence to suggest that calcium supplementation in critical illness may be deleterious. Five randomized controlled trials with 159 participants were detected. All of the five included studies were conducted in the USA. No trial evaluated the association between parenteral calcium supplementation in critically ill intensive care unit patients and the following outcomes: mortality, multiple organ dysfunction, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, costs, and complications of calcium administration. Some data on laboratory measurements (serum calcium) could be extracted. Nonetheless, these data provide little to guide the care of intensive care unit patients. The question of greater importance, "Does correcting hypocalcemia in critically ill patients provide any benefit in reducing mortality, the development of organ dysfunction, or the allocation of resources ?" remains to be answered. At present, the evidence base for guidelines regarding calcium administration in intensive care unit patients is poor.
The purpose of this review was to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation for core features of ASD and associated symptoms. We found only two small randomised controlled trials that evaluated omega-3 fatty acids for ASD. There is insufficient evidence that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation is an effective treatment for ASD. However, high quality large randomised controlled trials are needed before definite recommendations about this treatment can be made.
Randomised controlled trials of endovascular thrombectomy or intra-arterial thrombolysis, or both, plus routine medical treatment compared with routine medical treatment alone in people with a definite acute ischaemic stroke. No funding sources. We found 19 trials involving a total of 3793 participants. Treatment with endovascular thrombectomy can improve patients' chance of survival with the ability to function well without increasing the risk of bleeding in the brain or death. It is still unclear what the optimal time window is within which treatment is beneficial and whether treatment is effective in the posterior (supplying the rear part of the brain) circulation. There is also a need to study whether a strategy of primary endovascular thrombectomy or intra-arterial thrombolysis, or both, is superior to a strategy where intravenous (injected into the vein) clot-dissolving treatment is provided first in a local centre followed by transfer of selected patients to hospitals able to perform mechanical thrombectomy or intra-arterial thrombolysis, or both. We judged the available trials to be at low or unclear risk of bias, and so overall the evidence is reported to be of high certainty.
We looked for trials comparing oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to a a placebo (a tablet that contained no active medicine). We looked for any dose level. but the trial had to run for at least two months in people with cystic fibrosis. We found 17 trials and included four of these with a total of 287 people aged five to 39 years; one further trial has not yet been published in full and two are still ongoing; we will assess these when we have more information. Three of the four included trials compared ibuprofen to a placebo; two of these trials were run in the same center and used some of the same people. One trial compared a drug called piroxicam to placebo. The longest trial lasted four years.
We aimed to report on lung function, nutritional status, lung x-rays, how often intravenous antibiotics were needed, details about hospital admissions, survival and side effects. We combined results from the two largest ibuprofen trials and showed that those taking ibuprofen had a lower annual rate of decline in lung function which was consistent across three lung function measurements. We then looked at these results split by age (even though we did not originally plan to do this) and found that two of the measurements showed a slower rate of annual decline in lung function in younger children. Results from four trials showed that fewer participants in the ibuprofen group were admitted to hospital at least once compared to placebo, although it was not clear if the difference was just chance or not. In one trial, people taking a long-term high dose of ibuprofen were less likely to need intravenous antibiotics, had better nutritional status and healthier lungs as seen by X-ray. No major side effects were reported in the trials, but they had not been designed to show differences in the rates of side effects.
To summarize, we found evidence showing that a high dose of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, most notably ibuprofen, may slow the progression of lung damage in people with cystic fibrosis, especially in younger people. The long-term safety results are limited but we feel that there is enough evidence to suggest that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs be temporarily stopped when people with cystic fibrosis are receiving intravenous aminoglycosides or other drugs that may badly damage the kidneys.
The trial of the drug piroxicam did not report many results in a form that we could analyse in the review. We did not have any results for our main outcome of lung function. The only results we had reported no difference between the piroxicam group and the placebo group for the number of hospital admissions. We judged the evidence to be of moderate quality overall. We thought the three ibuprofen trials had a good or adequate level of methodological quality with little risk of bias to the results, but used a range of different outcomes and summary measures. We did not have any concerns with regards to risks of bias for the trial comparing piroxicam to placebo.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of experiment in which people are randomly allocated to one or more treatment groups) up until November 2017. The search identified 23 studies involving a total of 11,170 caregivers and their children. The ages of the children ranged from birth to 24 months. The caregivers received educational interventions alone while the control group received no intervention, usual care or any other non-educational intervention. The educational methods included printed materials such as leaflets, counselling, teaching sessions, peer support, videos and practical demonstrations. Generally, the education messages were focused on the introduction of semi-solid foods at the appropriate age, the types and amount of complementary foods to be fed to infants, and hygiene. Education reduced the number of caregivers that introduced semi-solid foods to their infants before six months of age by up to 12% (moderate-quality evidence). Hygiene practices of caregivers who received education also showed some improvement compared to those that did not (moderate-quality evidence). In studies conducted in the community, education increased the duration of exclusive breastfeeding, but not in studies conducted in health facilities. There was no convincing evidence of an effect of education on the growth of children (low to very low-quality evidence). We could not combine the results from different studies for diarrhoea, knowledge of caregivers and adequacy of complementary food. However, from the individual reports of the study authors, education led to a reduction in diarrhoea and an improvement in the knowledge of caregivers. It also led to improvement in the quality and quantity of complementary foods fed to infants.
Overall, we found evidence that education improves complementary feeding practices.
Fourteen studies met our inclusion criteria for this review and none of the exclusion criteria. Aspirin, steroid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (traditional and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors) showed no significant benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the use of these drugs cannot be recommended for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Ten studies, including over 1800 patients, were analysed to determine if patients sent to a nursing led inpatient unit benefited or at least fared no worse than patients in a unit providing usual care. Compared to usual care, patients in nursing led inpatients units functioned better and experienced greater well-being; more patients were discharged home and not to an institution after about 3 months (but not after 6 months); fewer were readmitted back into hospital soon after discharge; but they stayed in hospital longer. The number of deaths during stay in hospital and 3 to 6 months after discharge was similar between the units (but there was a trend for more deaths early while in nursing led inpatients units that needs to be researched further). It is still not known whether nursing led inpatient units save money - studies in the United Kingdom found them more expensive than usual care units but studies in the United States found them cheaper.
Different Chinese herbal medicine formulae (Shou Tai Pill, Yangxi Zaitai Decoction, Bushen Antai Decoction and some modified formulae) were used in the trials. The basic formula mostly contained some common Chinese herbal medicines (Chinese Dodder Seed, Chinese Taxillus Twig, Himalayan Teasel Root, Largehead Atractylodes Rhizome, Donkey-hide Glue, Eucommia Bark, Tangerine Peel, Szechwon Tangshen Root, White Paeony Root, Baical Skullcap Root, Mongolian Milkvetch Root, Chinese Angelica, etc). Western pharmaceutical medicines included tocolytic drugs such as salbutamol and magnesium sulphate, hormonal supplementation with human chorionic gonadotrophin, progesterone or dydrogesterone, and supportive supplements such as vitamin E, vitamin K and folic acid.
We searched for evidence on 1 June 2015 and found nine trials (861 women) to assess the effectiveness of the interventions. All trials were methodologically poor and at an unclear risk of bias overall. No trial used placebo, no treatment or bed rest as a control intervention. One trial studied the effectiveness of psychotherapy compared with Chinese herbs.
When Chinese herbal medicines were given in combination with other pharmaceuticals they were associated with higher rates of continuous pregnancy beyond 20 weeks (92.1% versus 72.0%, from two trials, involving 189 women) and live births (79.7% versus 44.2% from six trials, involving 601 women) compared to the other pharmaceuticals alone. Live birth rate was not different when comparing Chinese herbal medicines alone and other pharmaceuticals alone (in one trial, involving 80 women). A comparison of continuing pregnancy rate was not available in this trial. Compared with psychotherapy alone, the live birth rate was higher in the group of women who received a combination of Chinese herbal medicine and psychotherapy (91.1% versus 68.9%).
The majority of studies did not report any information about adverse effects for the mothers or the babies. Only two trials (involving 341 women) reported that no maternal adverse effects were found (one trial comparing (combined) medicines with other pharmaceuticals and one trial comparing combined Chinese herbal medicine alone versus other pharmaceuticals alone). Only one trial (comparing Chinese herbal medicine alone versus other pharmaceuticals alone) reported that there were no abnormal babies either before or after delivery.
No study recorded its limitations in the trial report. It is unclear which Chinese herbal medicines or their combinations are effective.
According to the unique diagnosis and classification of Chinese medicine, the preparations (formulae) may differ according to the subtype of recurrent miscarriage. Most Chinese medicine practitioners modify the classical prescriptions depending on the individual clinical presentations. Some herbal medicines were modified from the classical formula for treatment. Therefore, the conclusion on effectiveness in our study could only represent the overall effects of Chinese herbal medicines on recurrent miscarriage in general. In conclusion, combined Chinese herbal medicines and other pharmaceuticals appear more beneficial than other pharmaceuticals alone for unexplained recurrent miscarriage, but the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicines alone as treatment is unclear.
We found no data to evaluate the safety and toxicity of this intervention for women and their babies and no data for all of our other maternal and infant outcomes. More high-quality studies are necessary to fully evaluate the utility of Chinese herbal medicines for unexplained recurrent miscarriage.
Steroid drugs have been effective in improving lung function but early use is associated with an increase in adverse effects (see Early Review). The review of trials found that moderately early use of corticosteroids (started at 7-14 days) reduces the risk of developing CLD. There is limited evidence about possible long term harmful effects. Short term adverse effects include high blood pressure, infection and an excess of glucose in the blood of these preterm babies. More research is needed. Steroid use should be limited until more information is available.
This review found 20 studies that compared the effects of chronic disease management programmes in adults with asthma with the effects of usual care. The average age of the patients was 42.5 years, 60% were women, and they had moderate to severe asthma. Overall the evidence that was found was of moderate to low quality.
Chronic disease management programmes for adults with asthma probably improve patients' quality of life, reduce the severity of the asthma, and improve breathing as demonstrated by improved performance in lung function tests after 12 months. It is unclear whether chronic disease management programmes improve the patients' abilities to manage their own asthma or decrease the number of hospitalisations or emergency visits.
We performed a comprehensive literature search until 1 July 2018. We found five trials comparing robotic assisted versus open surgery. The total number of participants in these trials was 541. Four studies were conducted in the USA and one in the UK. There may be little to no difference in the time to recurrence, the rate of major complications or minor complications, quality of life, and rates of positive margins (signalling that cancer may have been left behind). Robotic surgery probably results in fewer blood transfusions and may lead to a slightly shorter hospital stay when compared with open surgery. Reviewers rated the certainty of evidence as low for most outcomes, except for minor complications (very low) and transfusions (moderate). This means that the true results for these outcomes could be quite different.
We identified nine studies (712 patients) that met our inclusion criteria; the quality of these studies was generally low. There were only two small studies which reported graft thrombosis in kidney transplants. One blood thinner called "unfractionated heparin" may increase the risk of bleeding following kidney transplantation, but this finding is of low certainty. The effect of blood thinners on our other outcomes (need for further surgery or readmission to intensive care, blood transfusion requirements, hospital stay, other side effects, blood clots elsewhere in the body, longevity of the transplanted organ and death) in kidney transplantation remains unclear.
Two studies investigated various blood thinners in two unique groups of patients who received a liver transplant. It remains unclear whether any of the blood thinning treatments they tested have any effect on graft thrombosis or major bleeding. The effect of blood thinners on other outcomes in liver transplant recipients also remains unclear.
There were no studies which investigated blood thinners in heart, lung, pancreas, or any other organ transplantation. There is a lack of evidence to guide the use of medications to prevent blood clots in transplanted organs. New research is needed to assess treatments to prevent blood clots, and also to investigate the risks of these treatments, such as major bleeding.
This is an update of the original review published in 2010. We performed a new search and found 10 new studies (with 4227 participants) to add to the original review, which changed some of the findings. In total, we found 28 randomised trials including 8950 participants that compared self-monitoring and self-management with standard monitoring. The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. The combined results of the 28 trials showed a halving of thromboembolic events with self-monitoring and self-management and no reduction in the number of major bleeds. Self-management had similar reductions in thromboembolic events and mortality to the overall benefit, with no effect on major bleeds. Self-monitoring halved the number of major haemorrhages that occurred but did not significantly reduce the rates of thrombotic events or all-cause mortality. In conclusion, self-monitoring or self-management can improve the quality of oral anticoagulant therapy, leading to fewer thromboembolic events and lower mortality, without a reduction in the number of major bleeds. Self-monitoring and self-management are not feasible for all patients, which requires the identification and education of suitable patients.
Searches for high-quality randomised trials were carried out in 2008, 2013 and 2015. The review now includes 15 studies with 2428 participants. The studies randomised participants (in- and outpatients) with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses into treatment groups that received oral risperidone or placebo. Results from limited data suggest that risperidone is more effective than placebo for reducing the overall symptoms of schizophrenia, and participants receiving risperidone were more likely to comply with treatment. However, like the older typical antipsychotics, risperidone was also associated with serious side effects, such as parkinsonism. The evidence available was very low quality. Information and data were limited, poorly reported, and probably biased in favour of risperidone . Nearly half of the included trials were funded by drug companies. Firm conclusions are difficult to make based on the results of this review. Better conduct and reporting of trials could increase confidence in the results.

Seventy trials were included in this review, of which 69 trials (257,899 women) were entered into a meta-analysis. Invitations, and to a lesser extent, educational materials probably increase the uptake of cervical screening (moderate-certainty evidence). HPV self-testing, as an alternative to Pap smears, may also increase screening coverage. However, self-testing was not covered in this review and will be considered in a subsequent review. Lay health workers used to promote screening to ethnic minority groups may increase screening uptake (low-certainty evidence).
It was difficult to deduce any meaningful conclusions for other less widely reported interventions such as counselling, risk factor assessment, access to health promotion nurse, photo comic book, intensive recruitment and message framing, due to sparse data and low-certainty evidence. However, having access to a health promotion nurse and attempts at intensive recruitment may increase uptake. The majority of the evidence was of a low to moderate certainty (quality) and further research may change these findings. For the majority of trials, the risk of bias was unclear, making it difficult to make firm assertions from their results. Invitation letters probably increase the uptake of cervical screening, and use of lay health worker involvement amongst ethnic minority populations may do so. Educational interventions may also increase screening; however, it is unclear what format is the most effective. These findings apply to developed countries and their relevance to low- and middle-income countries is unclear.
We searched the medical literature for trials (28 January 2016) to determine the effectiveness of medications and any adverse effects of the medications used for the treatment of itching. Unfortunately, we found no evidence from randomised controlled trials to assess whether medications applied directly to the skin (topically) or taken systemically for generalised itching in pregnancy are effective or safe.
High-quality randomised controlled trials assessing medications for generalised itching (not caused by a disease affecting the whole body or changes in the skin (lesions) in pregnant women are needed. Such studies should consider important outcomes such as relief of itching, women’s satisfaction, sleep disturbance and adverse effects of the interventions.
The evidence was updated until January 2013. We found five studies of children with asthma; of them, four studies, representing 559 children (aged six to 18 years) with mild to moderate asthma, contributed data to the review. No study enrolled pre-school children (i.e. aged under six years). Three studies compared the combination of anti-leukotrienes and ICS with the same dose of ICS alone; one study compared the combination of anti-leukotrienes and ICS to a higher dose of ICS; and no study tested whether the addition of anti-leukotriene to ICS could allow the tapering of the dose of ICS while maintaining asthma control. All studies used montelukast as the anti-leukotriene agent, which was administered for four to 16 weeks. Included studies enrolled both girls and boys and between 65% and 69% were boys. All trials enrolled children with mild to moderate airway obstruction. Whether comparing the addition of anti-leukotrienes to ICS to the same dose or an increased dose of ICS, there was no difference in the number of participants experiencing one or more moderate exacerbations (that is, requiring oral corticosteroids) or severe exacerbations (i.e. requiring a hospital admission). A single study comparing the same ICS dose reported lung function tests and showed no or small group differences depending on the test used. There is no firm evidence to support that adding montelukast to ICS is safe and effective to reduce the occurrence of moderate or severe asthma attacks in children taking low-dose ICS and whose symptoms remain uncontrolled. After being on the market for more than 10 years, the limited number of available studies testing antileukotrienes in children, the absence of data on preschoolers, and the inconsistency of available trials in reporting of efficacy and safety clinical outcomes is disappointing and limit the conclusions. This review is based on a small number of identified trials conducted in children with asthma; none were conducted in preschoolers. As a single study of moderate duration reported all measures of efficacy and most measures of safety, our confidence in the quality of evidence is low. Other important measures of asthma control were either not measured or reported in different formats, so they could not be pooled. In other words, there are too few paediatric trials to conclude firmly whether either treatment is superior to the other.
In July 2015 we searched for studies which tested combinations of behavioural support and medication to help smokers to stop compared to usual care or brief behavioural support. People who smoked were recruited mainly in health care settings. Some trials only enrolled people who said they wanted to try to quit at that time, but some included people who weren't planning to quit. Studies had to report how many people had stopped smoking after at least six months. We found 53 studies with a total of over 25,000 participants. One very large study found a large benefit. It gave intensive support including nicotine gum, multiple group sessions, and long term contact to help people stay quit or encourage additional quit attempts. Because it was not typical of most treatment programmes, it was not included when we estimated the likely benefit, although it shows that such intensive support can be very effective. Based on the remaining 52 studies, we found high quality evidence that using a combination of behavioural support and medication increases the chances of successfully quitting after at least six months. Combining the results suggests that the chance of success is increased by 70 to 100 percent compared to just brief advice or support. There was some evidence that the effect tended to be larger when participants were recruited in healthcare settings. There was no clear evidence that providing more contact increased the number of people who quit smoking at six months or longer. .
Overall, there were a number of methodological limitations across the trials included in this review. We found positive effects for psychological therapy based on CBT approaches at longer follow-up assessments, and for mentalisation-based therapy (MBT), and emotion-regulation psychotherapy on repetition of SH at post-intervention. There may also be some evidence of effects for standard dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) on frequency of SH repetition. However, remote contact interventions, case management, information and support, and other multimodal interventions do not appear to have benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. The promising results for CBT-based psychotherapy at longer follow-up time points, and for MBT, group-based emotion regulation, and DBT warrant further investigation to understand which people benefit from these types of interventions. Greater use of head-to-head trials (where treatments are directly compared with each other) may also assist in identifying which component(s) from these often complex interventions may be most effective.
We found 17 studies in 5110 people with advanced stomach or OGJ cancer. Studies compared further chemotherapy and/or biological therapies, given by mouth or through the bloodstream (systemic), with:
• another systemic chemotherapy and/or biological therapy;
• a placebo ('dummy' treatment);
• best supportive care; and
• no treatment.
The studies looked at:
• how long people lived;
• any adverse (unwanted) effects; and
• their quality of life (well-being). People probably live longer after further chemotherapy (irinotecan or trifluridine plus tipiracil) than with placebo treatment or best supportive care. But chemotherapy probably increases serious unwanted effects, including diarrhoea, fever, and lower numbers of red and white blood cells.
People may live as long after irinotecan chemotherapy as after paclitaxel chemotherapy. Adding another chemotherapy (oxaliplatin or cisplatin) to docetaxel may not affect how long people live.
People live longer after biological therapy (nivolumab, apatinib or regorafenib) than with placebo treatment. We did not find enough evidence about whether biological therapy increases unwanted effects.
People given immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) probably live as long as people given chemotherapy (paclitaxel), but may not have as many unwanted effects as with chemotherapy.
Combining chemotherapy with biological therapy probably does not help people live longer than chemotherapy alone, and we are uncertain whether it increases unwanted effects. We are moderately confident that chemotherapy probably helps people to live longer than placebo treatment or best supportive care. We are confident that people live longer on biological therapy than placebo treatment. We think more evidence is unlikely to change this result.
We are less confident about the results for unwanted effects. Some studies had missing data or did not report these; and in some studies people and their doctors knew which treatment was given, which could have affected the study results. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. If advanced stomach or OGJ cancer has not responded to standard chemotherapy, further chemotherapy or biological therapy help people to live longer than placebo treatment, best supportive care, or no treatment. However, chemotherapy is more clearly associated with unwanted effects than biological therapy.
We are unsure if biological therapies work better than chemotherapy, but they may cause fewer unwanted effects. Combining chemotherapy and biological therapies may cause more unwanted effects without giving any extra benefit.
We found one study with 26 children aged 4 to 12 years with CAS. The children had mild to severe CAS without a known cause. Children were allocated randomly (using a method like coin tossing) to one of two treatments: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme - Third Edition (NDP-3); and the Rapid Syllable Transition treatment (ReST). Both therapies were delivered intensively in one-hour sessions, four days a week for three weeks. The treatments were delivered by speech pathology students in a university clinic. Outcomes were assessed before therapy, immediately after therapy, at one month and four months post-therapy. Our review looked at one-month post-therapy outcomes only. The included study was funded by the Australian Research Council; the University of Sydney International Development Fund; Douglas & Lola Douglas Scholarship on Child and Adolescent Health; Nadia Verrall Memorial Scholarship; and a James Kentley Memorial Fellowship. Further studies replicating these findings would strengthen available evidence.
The study provides limited evidence that the NDP-3 may improve the accuracy of production on treated items and the accuracy of connected speech. There is limited evidence that the NDP-3 has a negligible effect on speech production consistency, and the ReST a negligible effect on accuracy of production on non-treated words. The study did not measure functional communication. The included study was a randomised controlled trial with an overall low risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one level to moderate, due to imprecision, given that only one RCT was identified. There is limited evidence that the NDP-3 or ReST may be helpful for children with CAS of unknown origin, aged 4 to 12 years, without other co-occurring conditions. We were not able to find out whether one of these treatment was better than the other, or whether either was better than no treatment or treatment as usual. There is currently no available evidence for other treatments.
Further RCTs — including studies comparing treatments to a no-treatment (wait-list) control group — would strengthen the evidence base. Further research is also needed for children with CAS and other disorders or diagnoses.
The evidence is current to May 2022. This review included 11 trials, with a total of 2717 participants, which investigated the effect of antifibrinolytic drugs in people with a subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm. Antifibrinolytic treatment reduces the risk of rebleeding, but does not improve overall survival, or the chance of being independent in everyday activities. We conclude that there is no evidence to support routinely giving antifibrinolytic treatment to people with a subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm. We assessed the evidence for the outcomes as moderate- to high-quality, which means we are very, or moderately confident in the results.
We searched for studies where people with cystic fibrosis were put into either a group for respiratory muscle training or a control group at random. We included ten studies with 238 people which used a wide variety of training methods and levels. In eight of the studies, the treatment group and the control group each only received either respiratory muscle training or a control treatment (one study had three groups in total: one receiving control treatment and two receiving different levels of training). In one study the participants received both types of treatment, but in a random order. Lastly, one study compared training with usual care. The studies lasted for a maximum of 12 weeks and all were quite small; the largest only had 39 people taking part. The studies included people with a range of ages over six years old, but most seemed to be adults. The studies reported a variety of outcomes. All reported some measure of respiratory muscle strength, and most reported at least one measure of lung function, however only three studies reported on quality of life. Results could not be combined to answer the review question, because the studies either did not publish enough details or did not use the same standard measurements. No study found any difference in lung function after training, but one of the studies reported an improvement in exercise duration when training at 60% of maximal effort and a further study which trained participants at 80% of maximal effort reported some improvements in quality of life judgements. There was some evidence of an improvement in respiratory muscle function in two studies.
Given this lack of information, a recommendation for or against respiratory muscle training cannot be made. Future studies should look to improve upon the methods of those previously conducted, and should report using standardised measurements. It was generally unclear how people were split into groups for treatment and whether this would have affected the results. Three studies stated that the people assessing the outcomes did not know which treatment those taking part had received, but this was unclear in other studies. Individuals dropped out of three of the studies for reasons which may be directly related to the treatment and therefore may introduce a risk of bias to the results. One study had no-one drop out and the other six studies did not state how many people dropped out of them. We assessed the quality of the evidence and judged the evidence for lung function, exercise capacity, postural stability and health-related quality of life to be very low quality, but the evidence for respiratory muscle function to be low quality.
In February 2013, we searched medical databases to look for controlled trials of participants who had undergone surgery and had been randomly assigned to nurse- or doctor-led preoperative assessment (POA). We found two trials, one randomized and one quasi-randomized. Both studies were conducted in the UK and compared POA performed by the nurse with POA performed by the non-specialist doctor. One studied 1874 adult participants who were undergoing elective surgery, and the other studied 595 children who were undergoing day surgery. Neither study reported on cancellations of surgery, gain in participant information or knowledge or perioperative complications. Reported outcomes focused on the accuracy of the assessment. As there is currently no evidence from trials concerning the impact of nurse-led POA on patient outcomes, we are unable to make any recommendations for practice on the basis of this review.
This update was unable to find any trials to include in this review. While we conclude that a randomised controlled trial should attempt to answer these questions, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated. Until there is firm evidence, clinicians should treat acute chest syndrome on a case by case basis and according to the diagnosis and the treatment available.
We included 20 studies, with 5885 participants, in this review. We searched for studies until June 2015. We were interested in the physicians' assessment of improvement, the participants' self-assessment, and any adverse effects. Other outcomes were by objective measures of improvement, such as SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis, a tool for measuring atopic dermatitis severity) and the affected body surface area. We found tacrolimus 0.1% to be better than low-potency TCS on the face and neck areas and moderate-potency TCS on the trunk and extremities. We evaluated the physician's assessment of pimecrolimus 1% and tacrolimus 0.03% in most of the studies. When compared with moderate-to-potent corticosteroids, there was a marginal benefit favouring tacrolimus 0.1% by the participant's self-assessment and SCORAD.
Combined results of 2 studies indicated that tacrolimus 0.03% more than doubled the chance of achieving improvement by the physician's assessment compared with mild TCS. Another study found tacrolimus 0.03% to be better than pimecrolimus 1% for the same outcome, while no difference was found on the body surface area of skin affected with disease. For the comparison with moderate-to-potent corticosteroids, we found no significant difference in most of the results, but in two studies, we found a slight difference favouring the corticosteroids group.
Burning and itching were more frequent in those using tacrolimus than TCS, but we found no difference in skin infection. Symptoms were mild and temporary. The comparison between pimecrolimus and tacrolimus showed the same overall frequency of side-effects, with local side-effects being more frequent in the tacrolimus groups. Tacrolimus also showed a longer duration of the local symptoms, between 30 minutes and 12 hours, while pimecrolimus users experienced symptoms for less than 30 minutes.
Serious adverse events were rare, occurred both in tacrolimus and TCS groups, and were considered to be unrelated to treatment in most instances. No cases of lymphoma (a type of cancer of the lymph nodes) were noted in the included studies nor in the non-comparative studies. Cases were only noted retrospectively in studies and reports, with no confirmed relation to the drug.
Systemic absorption (substance entering the bloodstream) was rarely detectable, only in low levels and decreased with time. Only in diseases with severe skin barrier problems, such as Netherton's syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis (rare genetic disorders), and a few others, were there case reports of systemic absorption.
After evaluating clinical trials, case reports, human and animal studies, we found a lack of evidence associating the use of topical tacrolimus with skin thinning.
In summary, tacrolimus ointment seems to be safe and effective for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children and adults. It should be used with caution, though, in those having diseases with a severely damaged skin barrier. We found no risk of skin thinning with its use, even for longer periods. We did not find any evidence associating a risk of malignancies with the use of topical tacrolimus. We did not evaluate costs in this review. The variability of drug doses, results, and follow-up periods made it difficult to combine the results. The lack of data limited the reliability and strength of the evidence; thus, findings of this review should be interpreted with caution.
We wanted to find out if antibiotics are effective for relieving signs and symptoms in children with AOM. We searched for studies that looked at the effectiveness of antibiotics compared with placebo or expectant observation (watchful waiting) in children aged from one month to 15 years with AOM. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and effect sizes. We found that antibiotics did not decrease the number of children with pain at 24 hours (when 60% of children recovered or improved), only slightly reduced the number of children with pain in the days following, and did not reduce the number of children with late AOM recurrences compared with placebo. However, antibiotics did slightly reduce the number of children with perforations (a rupture) of the eardrum and AOM in the initially unaffected ear compared with placebo. Antibiotics reduced the number of children with abnormal tympanometry (a test to evaluate how well the middle ear is functioning) findings at two to four weeks but not after six to eight weeks and three months.
There was not enough information to know if antibiotics reduced rare complications such as mastoiditis (infection of the bones around the ear). All the studies included in this review were from high-income countries. Data are lacking from populations in which the AOM incidence and risk of progression to mastoiditis is higher.
Antibiotics caused unwanted effects such as diarrhoea, vomiting and rash. It is difficult to balance the small benefits against the small harms of antibiotics in children with AOM. However, for most children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified. From the review of antibiotics against placebo, we are confident that antibiotics have no effect on pain in the first 24 hours and only a slight effect in the days following. We are only moderately confident that antibiotics reduce pain experienced 10 to 12 days after children are initially assessed. Our confidence is moderate because only one study reported this result from a secondary analysis. We are confident that antibiotics modestly reduce the number of children with abnormal tympanometry results after two to four weeks, but that they do not reduce the risk at three months. We are confident that antibiotics increase the risk of unwanted effects.
For the review of immediate antibiotics versus expectant observation, we have little confidence that immediate antibiotics reduce pain two to three days after assessment and are moderately confident that immediate antibiotics probably do not reduce pain at three to seven days. Our confidence is limited because of concerns about how some of the studies were conducted. Our evidence is current to 14 February 2023. The findings of this update are consistent with previous versions of the review.
We wanted to find out whether Ginkgo biloba reduces tinnitus severity and whether it has any unwanted or harmful effects. We searched for studies that looked at Ginkgo biloba compared to placebo ('dummy' treatment), no treatment or education/information alone in adults and children with tinnitus. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies had been done and how many people were involved. We found 12 studies (with a total of 1915 people who participated). Eleven studies compared the effects of Ginkgo biloba with placebo. One study compared the effects of Ginkgo biloba combined with hearing aids to hearing aids alone. When we combined the results of two studies that measured tinnitus severity in the same way we found that Ginkgo biloba may have little to no effect compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain. We looked at four studies that recorded any serious harmful effects, all of which reported none, so Ginkgo probably does not result in any difference in risk compared to placebo. However, the included studies did not look at the potentially harmful effects of Ginkgo biloba when used alongside other drugs. There may not be any difference between Ginkgo biloba and placebo in the effect on tinnitus loudness, but this is very uncertain. We also found that there may not be any difference in other outcomes (health-related quality of life and minor unwanted effects such as gastrointestinal upset, headache and allergic reaction). There is no evidence to suggest that Ginkgo biloba has an effect on tinnitus when compared to placebo.
We looked at the study that compared Ginkgo biloba combined with hearing aids to hearing aids alone. It assessed the difference in the change in tinnitus severity and loudness using a scale at three months. The study did not report any of the other outcomes we were interested in. This was a single, very small study (22 people) and the evidence was very uncertain. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the findings of this study. Although we found 12 studies, half of them did not report outcomes that we were interested in. We were not able to combine the results from many of the remaining studies. We are not confident in the evidence for the effect on tinnitus severity of Ginkgo biloba compared to placebo. This is because some people dropped out of one study, only people over 60 were included, the studies were small and very few studies reported this important outcome. We have little confidence in the evidence about serious harmful effects because none were reported in either group and the studies may have had some problems in the way they were done. For tinnitus loudness we are not confident in the evidence because the study that measured this was very small, some people dropped out and only this one study reported this important outcome. We have little confidence in the evidence for health-related quality of life and minor unwanted effects because the studies were small and may have had problems with the way they were done.
We are not confident in the evidence for the effects of Ginkgo in combination with hearing aids because the number of participants in the study was very small. The evidence is up to date to June 2022.
We searched for evidence in March 2019 and identified six trials that met the inclusion criteria for the review. Outcomes from an additional 1100 women from these six trials was combined with those from the previous version of this review for a total of 10,018 women (23 trials). Of note, two previously included trials were excluded from this current review due to methodological concerns.
The majority of trials contributing information to this review were found to be at high risk of bias. The quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate, and for most outcomes was assessed as low to very low quality.
Our results showed that compared to no uterotonics or placebo, oxytocin may reduce the risk of blood loss (quality of evidence: low) and the need for additional uterotonics (quality of evidence: moderate). The effect of oxytocin compared with ergot alkaloids is uncertain with regards to blood loss (quality of evidence: very low), need for additional uterotonics (quality of evidence: very low), and need for blood transfusion (quality of evidence: very low), but may increase the risk of a third stage greater than 30 minutes (quality of evidence: moderate). Whether or not this translates into increased risk of needing a manual placental removal is uncertain (quality of evidence: very low). This potential risk of retained placenta must be weighed against a possible increased risk of side effects with ergot alkaloids, including diastolic hypertension (quality of evidence: low), vomiting (quality of evidence: very low), and headaches (quality of evidence: very low). While the combination of oxytocin and ergometrine may slightly reduce the risk of blood loss compared to ergot alkaloids (quality of evidence: low), the certainty of this conclusion is low given the poor quality of contributing studies. Oxytocin may reduce blood loss and the need for additional uterotonics when given prophylactically in the third stage of labour, and therefore could be considered as a component of AMTSL. The side-effect profile may be more favourable than ergot alkaloids, which must be weighed against a possible increased risk of third stage greater than 30 minutes and unclear benefit of oxytocin or ergot alkaloids with regards to blood loss.

More placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blinded trials are needed to improve the quality of data used to compare oxytocin versus ergot alkaloids. Future studies should aim to include important outcomes such as maternal mortality, shock, transfer to a higher level of care, serious side effects, and other patient-centred outcomes. A large complex review analysing all available data from different uterotonic medications (network meta-analysis) will help to inform future choice of uterotonic and the best route and dose of administration.
Our main goal was to find out whether HL interventions can help migrants to improve their HL. We also wanted to find out if migrant women or migrant men benefit more from these interventions. We searched for studies that looked at interventions for improving HL in migrants. These interventions were compared with 1) no HL intervention (e.g. standard care), 2) written information on the same health topic (e.g. brief brochure), 3) an unrelated HL intervention (participants received a similar intervention, but the information was on a different health topic), or 4) another HL intervention (participants received a different intervention, but the information was on the same health topic).
The included studies measured HL either as an overall concept or only components of it (e.g. understanding health information). We compared and summarised the results of studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors like study methods. We found 34 studies that involved 8249 migrants with a wide range of health conditions. All studies were conducted in high-income countries. All interventions were adapted to the participants' culture, language and literacy level. None of the studies reported that HL interventions cause harm, but only two studies reported possible harms (anxiety). Many studies reported short-term results (up to six weeks after the intervention ended, the focus in this summary). There were also several findings at later time points (presented in the main review).  (long-term programmes including group education and personal support)probably improve self-efficacy in managing one's disease slightly (which means that the participants had higher beliefs in their abilities to act on health information). SMP may also improve disease-specific HL and may slightly improve health behaviour, but may have little effect on knowledge or self-rated health. We do not know if SMP improves quality of life (QoL) or health service use. (group education in which participants, for example, learn what to do to prevent a disease)may improve knowledge and generic HL, but they may have little effect on depression literacy or health behaviour. We do not know if they improve QoL, health outcomes, health service use or self-efficacy. (including video education, interactive computer education or printed educational photo stories)probably improves depression literacy and health service use. AVE may improve self-efficacy and slightly improve knowledge and intention to seek depression treatment, but may have little effect on health behaviour or depression. No study reported on QoL. dapted medical instructions(medical instructions that use simple language, illustrations or pictures)may improve understanding health information, but may have little effect on medication adherence. No study reported on QoL, health outcomes, knowledge, health service use or self-efficacy.  probably improves print literacy and self-efficacy, and health numeracy slightly. SMP may improve any disease-specific HL, knowledge and some health behaviours, but may have little effect on health information appraisal. We do not know whether SMP improves QoL, health outcomes or health service use. probably has little effect on diabetes HL but probably improves information appraisal and application. AVE may slightly improve knowledge. No study reported on QoL, depression, health behaviour, self-efficacy or health service use. We are uncertain if narrative videos are better than factual knowledge videos as the evidence was very uncertain. Migrant women's diabetes HL may improve slightly more than that of migrant men after receiving AVE. For other comparisons and outcomes we either did not find evidence, or we are uncertain about the results. It is possible that people in some studies knew which treatment they were getting. In addition, studies were done in different migrant groups, coming from different regions and with different health conditions, and some studies included few people. This review is up-to-date to 2 February 2022.
A systematic review of a particular diagnostic test for a disease aims to bring together and assess all the available research evidence. Bibliographic databases are usually searched by combining terms for the disease with terms for the diagnostic test. However, depending on the topic area, the number of articles retrieved by such searches may be very large. Methodological filters consisting of text words and database indexing terms have been developed in the hope of improving the searches by increasing their precision when these filters are added to the search terms for the disease and diagnostic test. On the other hand, using filters to identify records for diagnostic reviews may miss relevant studies while at the same time not making a big difference to the number of studies that have to be assessed for inclusion. This review assessed the performance of 70 filters (reported in 19 studies) for identifying diagnostic studies in the two main bibliographic databases in health, MEDLINE and EMBASE. The results showed that search filters do not perform consistently, and should not be used as the only approach in formal searches to inform systematic reviews of diagnostic studies. None of the filters reached our minimum criteria of a sensitivity greater than 90% and a precision above 10%.
This evidence is current up to July 2018. We included 26 studies involving 23,499 participants. These studies assessed the effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-lowering drugs versus lipid-lowering drugs alone for heart disease. The participants were adults, and most of them had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk for combined outcome of death due to heart disease, heart attack or stroke, but the benefit is moderate. However, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate have little or no effect on death from any cause. Treatment with ezetimibe and statin probably reduces the risk for non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal stroke. Adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate probably have little or no effect on heart-related death. Ezetimibe with statins might reduce the need for coronary revascularisation (the restoration of an adequate blood supply to the heart) by means of surgery.
In terms of safety, we do not have enough evidence to know whether ezetimibe increases or decreases side-effects (e.g. liver injury, muscle pain, cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation). The analysis of blood lipids revealed that the addition of ezetimibe statin or fenofibrate therapy might further reduce the levels of blood lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), total cholesterol and triglycerides, and likely increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('good' cholesterol). None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life. There is a lack of evidence supporting the use of ezetimibe monotherapy for the prevention of heart disease, and this topic requires further investigation. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low across the outcomes.
We found one study involving 210 patients with asthma. The trial compared adding tiotropium (a LAMA) to doubling the dose of beclomethasone (a steroid).
In the trial, people taking a combination of the LAMA and ICS were slightly less likely to have an asthma attack needing treatment with oral steroids. Our results suggest that for every 1000 people, 18 fewer in the LAMA group would need these treatments compared to patients treated with an increased dose of ICS. However, there is a relatively wide margin of error in this estimate, and the actual number of patients on LAMA who might need steroids because of an asthma attack could range from 52 fewer to 26 more people per 1000. Similarly, neither option was more clearly beneficial on any of the following measures: asthma attacks resulting in hospitalisation or admission to the emergency department, serious adverse events, control of asthma or quality of life related to asthma. On the other hand, LAMA plus ICS might improve lung function a bit more than increasing ICS dose.
We didn't have much confidence in the findings because the one included study only looked at one type of LAMA (tiotropium) for a short period of time (14 weeks).
We searched the medical literature to July 2020. We found one study that compared treatment with BtA (Dysport) versus an anticholinergic drug (trihexyphenidyl) for 12 weeks. The study included 66 participants, who had experienced cervical dystonia for an average of 9.4 years, but had never received BtA treatment. On average, they had moderate impairment. The average age of people in the study was 50.7 years. The trial was funded by the BtA drug manufacturer. The results show that Dysport, when compared with trihexyphenidyl, may improve symptoms of cervical dystonia, pain, and quality of life. The risk of having an unpleasant or undesirable event, particularly dry mouth and memory issues, was increased in people taking trihexyphenidyl.
We found no information on the effects of different doses of BtA, different formulas of BtA or types of anticholinergics, the usefulness of guiding injections by electromyography, or how long the effects lasted. Due to limitations in the study methods and size of the study, we have very little confidence in the results.
These conclusions may not apply to all people with cervical dystonia. They do not apply to long-term use of either treatment.
We searched major medical databases for studies that have examined the use of lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia. We identified five relevant studies that were conducted according to existing standards of research. A total of 537 people with schizophrenia participated in these five studies. The participants were resistant to various degrees to usual treatments and were randomised to receive either lamotrigine or placebo in addition to their usual drugs. The data regarding effectiveness could only be usefully analysed in less than 70 participants. Lamotrigine was considered to be effective if the questionnaire scores showed a greater reduction than for those who received placebo. The magnitude of this effect was small when compared to placebo.
Data regarding adverse effects were available from three studies. There was a higher occurrence of nausea in those receiving lamotrigine. Apart from this the common side effects were headache and dizziness.
The current evidence does not suggest that the addition of lamotrigine is a remarkable strategy for people with resistant schizophrenia, but the results are suggestive of a positive effect on the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, more studies with larger number of participants are needed to confirm the true magnitude of benefit and safety. This review is limited by the poor presentation of data from the individual studies.
However, this update the review first published in 2002 (D'Angelo 2002) found there is not enough evidence to show whether using frozen embryos and or intravenous albumin infusion (artificial fluid to increase the woman's blood volume) can reduce OHSS in women who are at high risk. More research is needed on effects on pregnancy rates.
This review of ten randomised controlled trials suggests there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of any one particular intervention in the management of women who are poor responders. More research is needed with good quality trials looking at relevant outcomes such as live birth rates rather than treatment-associated outcomes such as positive pregnancy rates or number of eggs. Research is also recommended in adverse outcomes and costs of these treatments.
We identified 37 trials conducted between 1969 and 1999. The evidence is current up to April 2015. Trials were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States of America and included 11,948 participants. Trials were conducted in pre-hospital and in-hospital settings and included individuals with or without proved acute myocardial infarction. Some trials did not limit results to acute myocardial infarction only. Lidocaine was given by intravenous (bolus and/or infusion) and intramuscular (alone or in combination with intravenous dosage) routes. Overall, trials included small sample sizes and reported low numbers of events. All trials had high risk of bias. Ten trials were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. In people who had known or suspected heart attack, we found that lidocaine compared with placebo, no intervention or any other antiarrhythmic drug had very small or no effects on death, cardiac death and ventricular fibrillation. Our confidence in the results of this review is low because the included trials that we synthesised were of low quality (overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms) and were conducted with a small number of participants, leading to imprecision of results.
We searched medical databases for studies that assessed the use of interventions delivered by mobile phones and their impact on the use of contraception. We found 23 trials of 12,793 women undertaken in 11 countries in both high-income (11 studies) and low-income (12 studies) settings. These studies compared the standard of care to a mobile phone intervention – such as one-way text message reminders, interactive messages (which required a response from clients), voice messages or a mobile app. The results across the studies were mixed; however, when the results were pooled, we found there is a positive effect of using interventions delivered by mobile phones and increasing use of contraception.
There were no differences in unintended pregnancies between the groups who used the mobile phone tools and those who did not.
Using interactive methods of mobile phone tools appears better at improving contraceptive use over one-way mobile phone interventions. There is not enough evidence about the safety or negative consequences of mobile phone tools for improving contraception use.
Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the results. It appears interventions delivered by mobile phones are beneficial in improving the use of contraception. Our analysis was limited by the quality of evidence we found, which makes it hard to form more robust conclusions. More good-quality research is required in the area of health messaging and contraception. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.
The evidence is current to January 2013. We included 15 studies containing a total of 1282 participants with MCI. The majority of studies (n = 9) were published between 2010 and 2013. The remaining six studies were published between 2004 and 2009. All of the included studies were conducted in Europe.
Study sizes varied and ranged from 15 to 231 participants.The mean (range) age of the youngest sample was 64 years (45 to 76) and the mean (standard deviation) age of the oldest sample was 73.4 (6.6) years. Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting, with a majority of studies at unclear risk of bias due to insufficient details given on how participants were selected and how the clinical diagnosis of dementia was established. According to the assessment of how the CSF tests were conducted and analysed, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality. Below is a summary of key findings for the tests:
CSF t-tau test for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia
The sensitivity values in seven individual studies ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity values ranged from 48% to 88%. The statistical analysis of those studies showed that, at the fixed specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 77%, and, at the prevalence of 37%, the positive predictive value was 62% and the negative predictive value was 84%. Based on these results, on average 62 out of 100 people with MCI and a positive index test result would convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia but 38 would not; on average, 84 out of 100 people with MCI and with a negative index test result would not convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 16 would.
CSF p-tau test for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia
The sensitivity values in six individual studies ranged from 40% to 100% while the specificity values ranged from 22% to 86%. The statistical analysis of those studies showed that, at the fixed specificity of 48%, the estimated sensitivity was 81%, and, at the prevalence of 37%, the positive predictive value was 48% and the negative predictive value was 81%. Based on these results, on average 48 out of 100 people with MCI and with a positive index test result would convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 52 would not; on average, 81 out of 100 people with MCI with a negative index test result would not convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 19 would.
We found that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostic test, as a single test, lacks the accuracy to identify those people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who would develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time. The data suggested that a negative CSF test, in people with MCI, almost indicates the absence of Alzheimer's disease as the cause of their clinical symptoms. However, a positive CSF test does not confirm the presence of Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology (cause) of their clinical symptoms.
There were methodological problems in the included studies that did not allow for a clear answer to the review question. The main limitations of the review were poor reporting in the included studies, lack of a widely accepted threshold of the CSF diagnostic tests in people with MCI, variability in length of follow-up, and the marked variation in CSF tests’ accuracy between the included studies.
Women with stage I (early) endometrial cancer have a low risk of recurrence of their disease. Less than 10% of women treated with surgery alone have a recurrence after surgery. This risk is significantly higher (and may be double) for some women with high risk factors including aggressive cell types (grade 3) and deep invasion of the muscle (stage IC). External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after surgery reduces the risk that the cancer will initially recur in the pelvis by around two-thirds compared to surgery alone, but does not reduce the risk of death.
EBRT carries an inherent risk of lasting treatment-related side-effects and routine use should be avoided in stage I endometrial cancer. However, from the available evidence, we cannot exclude the possibility of EBRT benefiting women with high-risk stage I disease. Vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) appears to be useful in reducing locoregional recurrence and may be associated with less side-effects than EBRT.
Some medications that are used to treat cramps in people with no medical condition or with conditions other than ALS have been tested in ALS clinical trials. These medicines include vitamin E, creatine, quinidine, and gabapentin. Other medications such as quinine sulfate, magnesium, lioresal, dantrolene, clonazepam, diphenylhydantoin, and gabapentin have been used to treat cramps in people with ALS but their effectiveness is unknown. In 2006 and 2010 the US Food and Drugs Administration issued warnings concerning the use of quinine sulfate, which was the previously most widely prescribed medication for cramps in the US. This review sought to find out how effective medications and physical treatments for cramps are for people with ALS. The reviewers identified 20 randomised controlled trials in people with ALS comprising a total of 4789 participants. Only one trial, of the drug tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), directly investigated the effectiveness of an intervention for cramps. Thirteen randomised controlled ALS trials investigated cramps secondarily among other variables. The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L-threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine. Six randomised controlled ALS trials investigated cramps as adverse events. The medications comprised creatine, gabapentin, dextromethorphan, quinidine and lithium. None of the 20 studies could demonstrate any benefit, but the studies were small. Current evidence on the treatment of cramps in ALS is lacking and more research is needed.
We searched for evidence in May 2021 and identified 17 trials involving 9409 women. The evidence is of low to moderate certainty because of limitations in the ways the studies were conducted. There was considerable variation in how early discharge was defined, ranging from six hours to four to five days. In most of the trials included in this review, early discharge was accompanied by some level of nursing or midwifery support. None of the trials took place in low-income countries.
Early discharge probably slightly increases the number of babies readmitted to hospital within 28 days of being born (10 studies, 6918 babies, moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether early discharge has any effect on the risk of babies dying within 28 days (two studies, 4882 babies). Early postnatal discharge probably makes little to no difference to the number of babies having at least one unscheduled medical consultation or contact with health professionals within the first four weeks after birth (four studies, 639 babies, moderate-certainty evidence).
Early discharge probably results in little to no difference in the number of women readmitted to hospital within six weeks of giving birth for complications related to childbirth (11 studies, 6992 women, moderate-certainty evidence). No deaths were reported. The number of women having at least one unscheduled medical consultation or contact with health professionals was not clearly different (two studies, 464 women, moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, early discharge may result in little to no difference in the risk of depression within six months after giving birth (five studies, 4333 women, low-certainty evidence).
Early discharge probably results in little to no difference in the number of women breastfeeding at six weeks after giving birth or in the number of women having at least one unscheduled medical consultation or contact with health professionals.
Early discharge may slightly reduce the costs of hospital care with little to no difference in the cost of care from discharge to six weeks after the birth. The risk of babies being readmitted to hospital is probably higher following early discharge of mothers and their babies from hospital after the birth, but is probably not higher for women being readmitted to hospital after early discharge. We are uncertain about the risk of death for babies and mothers following early discharge, because these are uncommon events. Differences between early discharge and standard discharge in terms of maternal depression, breastfeeding, the number of contacts with health professionals and costs of care are not clearly different, and until further studies are done to investigate these factors, the evidence remains of low certainty.
The review authors searched the medical literature and identified four randomized controlled trials comparing mannitol to other treatment strategies for reducing brain swelling after head injury. One trial compared treatment with mannitol directed by measurement of the pressure within the skull (intracranial pressure) with ‘standard treatment’ (treatment without measurement of intracranial pressure). One trial compared treatment with mannitol to treatment with pentobarbital (a barbiturate drug). One trial compared treatment with mannitol to treatment with hypertonic saline (highly concentrated salt solution). One trial compared treatment with mannitol to treatment with placebo (an inactive ‘dummy’ solution) before arrival in the hospital (pre-hospital). The review found that treatment with mannitol for increased intracranial pressure reduced the likelihood of death when compared to treatment with pentobarbital. In contrast, it found that treatment with mannitol may increase the likelihood of death when compared to treatment with hypertonic saline. The review also found a small benefit when mannitol treatment is directed by measurement of intracranial pressure compared to ‘standard treatment.’ The review found insufficient data on the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol.
The evidence obtained is current to September 2013. We re-ran the search in February 2015 and we will deal with the study awaiting classification when we update the review. We included 10 studies involving 813 participants. The included studies compared propofol with five other alternative drugs used to sedate people in the ED. We could not pool the results of the 10 studies because no two studies compared the same drug options. We found very low quality evidence for the effects of propofol and the other drugs used for sedating people in the ED in terms of complications (side effects, including pain at the injection site) and participant satisfaction. In one study comparing a drug combination of propofol and fentanyl (a painkiller) with midazolam and ketamine (a drug which acts as both a painkiller and a sedative), delayed adverse reactions (nightmares and behavioural change) were noted in 10% of the ketamine/midazolam group and none in the propofol/fentanyl group. The quality of the evidence was overall very low.
In this review, 14 double-blind, placebo controlled randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were found. They did not all measure the same outcomes and several did not explain what other heart failure treatments patients were receiving. Those trials that could be included in a meta-analysis showed improvements in heart failure symptoms and in the function of the heart. The results, therefore, are suggestive of a benefit from hawthorn extract used in addition to conventional treatments for chronic heart failure.
We aimed to identify research studies that tested music interventions combined with standard care for adults with acquired brain injury who were receiving rehabilitation in hospital or community settings. We looked for research that tested the effects of music interventions on walking, moving, communicating, thinking, emotions, pain, and well-being. Interventions included moving to music, singing, listening to music, composing, playing musical instruments, or a combination of these. We identified and included 29 trials involving 775 adult participants. The evidence is current to June 2015. The results suggest that music interventions using rhythm may be beneficial for improving walking in people with stroke, and this may improve quality of life. Music interventions may be beneficial for improving the speed of repetitive arm movements and communication in people with stroke. Music interventions that use a strong beat within music may be more effective than interventions where a strong beat is used without music. Treatment delivered by a trained music therapist might be more effective than treatment delivered by other professionals. Information was insufficient to examine the effects of music interventions on other outcomes. We found no studies that reported on harmful effects. The quality of the research was generally low. We found only one study that we considered as having a low risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for walking speed and stride length was moderate. The quality of the evidence for other aspects of walking was low. The quality of the evidence for the speed of repetitive arm movements was very low, as was the quality of the evidence for overall communication. The quality of the evidence for quality of life was low. Further clinical trials are needed.
We included 12 trials with 695 participants. Five of the 12 studies included participants awaiting planned heart surgery, and seven studies included participants awaiting planned major abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to October 2014. This review showed that training of breathing muscles before surgery reduced the risk of some lung complications (atelectasis and pneumonia) after surgery and the length of hospital stay, compared with usual care. However, the effect of this training on in-hospital death after surgery is unclear and needs further investigation. The trials did not report any undesirable effects associated with training of breathing muscles, and no study reported on costs resulting from breathing training using a device. Although the available evidence is insufficient in terms of the quality and size of trials, we can conclude that training of breathing muscles before surgery prevents lung complications after surgery. This training is easily performed at home under the supervision of a physiotherapist. The training of breathing muscles therefore appears to be a suitable option as one of the preparations for planned surgery, especially for adults awaiting high-risk heart and abdominal surgery. Other surgeries, such as oesophageal resection (removal of part of the gastrointestinal tract 'food pipe'), should be evaluated; cost-effectiveness and patient-reported outcomes should be reported. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect needs to be considered when interpreting the present findings, as the quality of evidence is low to moderate.
This review examined the research published up to the 14th of April, 2016, and identified 11 studies involving 1760 participants. Eight of the studies compared LVRS versus standard medical care, one compared two closure techniques (stapling vs laser ablation), one looked at the effect of buttressing the staple line on the effectiveness of LVRS and one compared a traditional approach to LVRS with a 'non-resectional' surgical approach. All participants completed a mandatory course of pulmonary rehabilitation/physical training before the procedure commenced. This review found that people undergoing LVRS were at increased risk of death at three months after the procedure. By the end of follow-up, death rates were lower for participants treated with LVRS than for those given standard medical care. Participants who were characterised by poor lung function with a particular distribution of diseased tissue in their lungs were at higher risk of death at three months and throughout one large study. One study identified a group of participants who responded better to LVRS than other participants, making them especially suitable for this treatment. The benefit of surgery for surviving participants was significant in terms of quality of life, exercise capacity and lung function, but costs of the procedure are relatively high, and patients had a greater chance of adverse events after the procedure. The quality of the data reported is low to moderate in nature owing to some methodological issues of the trials (lack of blinding, unclear risk of bias). The results presented in this review are largely dominated by one influential study, which accounted for 68% of the participants.
We wanted to find out which treatments help slow or stop the formation and growth of cysts in the kidney, the progression to kidney failure, and the harms of these medications. We searched for studies that assessed the benefits and harms of randomly allocated treatments for preventing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease progression. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as trial methods and sizes. We found 57 studies that randomised 8016 people to 18 different treatments. Studies were conducted around the world, mainly in Europe and the United States. Treatment duration and follow-up ranged from two days to seven years. The types of interventions included medication that alters the way the kidney concentrates the urine, medication aimed at stabilising the volume of the cysts and preventing them from growing, blood pressure-lowering medication, lipid-lowering medication, fish oil, and dietary changes such as the amount of water a person drinks.
Compared to placebo (dummy medicine), tolvaptan (a class of medicine known as vasopressin 2 receptor antagonists) probably preserves kidney function and slows the increase in total kidney volume; however, it may increase dry mouth and thirst and probably increases waking at night to urinate and fatigue.
Reducing blood pressure to lower than standard targets and somatostatin analogues (a medicine aimed to suppress growth factors) probably slowed the growth of the kidneys; however, they probably do not result in any difference in kidney function. Somatostatin analogues probably increase hair loss, diarrhoea, dizziness and fatigue, while reducing blood pressure probably does not result in more side events. Their effect on death was uncertain. Other treatments investigated had unclear results, with data being sparse and inconclusive. The small number of studies per comparison and the small size of the studies were limitations in this review. Not all the studies provided data about the outcomes we were interested in.
We are moderately confident that tolvaptan preserves kidney function and slows total kidney volume growth. We are also moderately confident that targeted lower blood pressure and somatostatin analogues decrease total kidney volume but have little or no effect on preserving kidney function.
We are very uncertain about any of the other treatment options. The evidence is current to August 2024.
This review examined the use of a fixed interval of voiding for the management of urinary incontinence in adults. This approach to urinary incontinence is thought to be common in aged care homes for people who require assistance from other people for toileting and continence care. The reviewers found two trials that had evaluated timed voiding. They included 298 elderly women who were living in aged care homes and had reduced cognition and impaired mobility. Reductions in the number of incontinence episodes were reported in each trial. The reviewers found insufficient data for these findings to be combined. Hence, at this point in time, there is not enough evidence on the effects of timed voiding for the management of urinary incontinence.
Despite a comprehensive search in June 2015, we were unable to identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. No trials could be included in this review. We therefore conclude that there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing recurrent sore throat and this finding must be balanced against the known adverse effects and cost of antibiotic therapy when considering antibiotics for this purpose. We have identified a need for high quality randomised controlled trials that compare the effects of antibiotics versus placebo in adults and children with pre-existing recurrent sore throat on the following outcomes: incidence of sore throat recurrence, adverse effects, days off work and absence from school, and the incidence of complications.
This review aimed to determine which treatment approach was better for women with subfertility and endometriomata who were undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART). Four trials were identified. A gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist showed a positive treatment effect on the ovarian response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) and the number of mature oocytes retrieved compared to GnRH antagonist. The evidence for surgery was limited but aspiration was associated with a greater ovarian response than expectant management (a wait and see approach). Further randomised controlled trials of interventions for the management of endometrioma in women undergoing ART are required.
We included twelve randomised trials (577 participants) in this updated review. Most of the included trials studied foot ulcers in people with diabetes (10 trials).
For diabetes-related foot ulcers, we found that HBOT seemed to improve the chance of healing in the short term (up to six weeks), but not with longer term follow-up. HBOT may reduce the number of major amputations in people with diabetes who have chronic foot ulcers.
For chronic wounds caused by disease to the veins of the leg, we found that HBOT may reduce the size of wounds.
For chronic wounds caused by lack of blood supply through the arteries or chronic pressure ulcers, we found no evidence to confirm or refute any effects of HBOT.
We could not assess safety as none of the trials included in our review reported whether there were any major adverse events.
This plain language summary is up-to-date as of 23/1/15
The Cochrane Oral Health Information Specialist searched the medical literature up to 10 May 2019. We found two studies, one where the participants had been randomly chosen to have their wisdom teeth removed or not (a randomised controlled trial or RCT), and one where the study authors examined people who have opted themselves to either retain or remove their wisdom teeth (a prospective cohort study). The studies involved 493 people. The RCT was conducted at a dental hospital in the UK and included 77 adolescent male and female participants who had completed treatment with braces. The cohort study was conducted at a private dental clinic in the USA and involved 416 men aged 24 to 84 years who volunteered to take part. The available evidence is insufficient to tell us whether or not asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth should be removed.
The included studies did not measure health-related quality of life, costs or side effects of taking teeth out.
One study (the cohort study), which was at serious risk of bias, found that keeping asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth in the mouth may increase the risk of gum infection (periodontitis) affecting the adjacent second molar in the long term, but this evidence was very uncertain. In the same study, the evidence was insufficient to draw any conclusions about the effect on the risk of caries in the adjacent second molar.
The other study (the RCT) was also at high risk of bias. It measured crowding of the teeth in the mouth, and found that this may not be significantly affected by whether impacted wisdom teeth are kept in the mouth or removed. We assessed the evidence provided by the two studies to be low to very low certainty, so we cannot rely on these findings. High-quality research is urgently needed to support clinical practice in this area. There is a lack of scientific evidence on which dental health professionals and policy makers can base treatment decisions for asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. Dental professionals will therefore be guided by clinical expertise and local or national clinical guidance, taking patient preferences into account. Where asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth are not removed, monitoring by a dental health professional at regular intervals will help identify and address any problems that may develop.
We found 11 studies with 1074 participants. A broad range of people were included in these studies, including people with heart failure, elite athletes, people with restless legs syndrome and otherwise fit and well women. We excluded studies that looked at children, pregnant women, and people being treated with erythropoietin (a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells). Intravenous iron may lead to a small increase in the level of haemoglobin in the blood. We also assessed the effect of intravenous iron on quality of life, serum ferritin (iron stored in the body), peak exercise capacity, and milder side-effects of iron administration but we were unable to determine whether or not intravenous iron was of benefit for these outcomes. This is because there were many differences between studies in the types of participants studied, the definition of iron deficiency used, the type of intravenous iron preparation prescribed and the length of the studies. We also tried to collect data on severe side effects and bacterial infection after iron infusion, but we were unable to find any studies that measured these effectively. Because of the many differences between the relatively small number of studies included in this review, we are uncertain about the effect of intravenous iron in non-anaemic iron deficiency beyond saying that it might cause an increase in haemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, the starting level of haemoglobin for people included in this review was considered 'normal' prior to their receiving treatment. Therefore, not only is this increase quite small, but the starting level of haemoglobin was considered adequate according to current guidance, and patients may not even notice an improvement in symptoms. We are not suggesting that intravenous iron is not of benefit for adults with non-anaemic iron deficiency, rather that the current quality of evidence is not good enough to be certain about the effects of these drugs. Overall, the evidence for intravenous iron for the treatment of non-anaemic iron deficiency is of low or very low quality. Whilst intravenous iron might cause a small increase in haemoglobin concentration from an already normal level, we are uncertain about its effects in other outcomes that we examined as part of this review. Further research examining the effects of intravenous iron for the treatment of adults with non-anaemic iron deficiency is required to help answer this research question.
The evidence is current to October 2019.
We included 21 studies and we interpreted our findings to indicate that financial conflicts of interest are associated with favourable recommendations in these documents, although there is some uncertainty around the size of the effect. This means that when such publications are written by authors with financial conflicts of interest, they more often have favourable recommendations than publications written by authors without conflicts of interest. Only a single study investigated the impact of non-financial conflicts of interest in clinical guidelines and the results were uncertain, but indicated a similar direction of effect.
We suggest that patients, doctors, and healthcare decision makers primarily use clinical guidelines, opinion pieces, and narrative reviews that have been written by authors without financial conflicts of interest. If that is not possible, users should read and interpret the publications with caution. Furthermore, our findings suggest that if committee members are asked to vote on the recommendation of a drug, they may be more likely to vote in favour of the drug when they have financial conflicts of interest.
This review examined trials which compared antidepressants with 'active' placebos, that is placebos containing active substances which mimic side effects of antidepressants. Small differences were found in favour of antidepressants in terms of improvements in mood. This suggests that the effects of antidepressants may generally be overestimated and their placebo effects may be underestimated.
We found five randomised controlled trials including 277 women that examined the effect of acupuncture or acupressure in women with PMS. The evidence is current to September 2017. We also ran a smaller search in November 2017 to see if we had missed any recently published studies. Three trials compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, one compared acupuncture with no treatment and one compared acupressure with sham acupressure. Acupuncture may reduce overall mood and physical PMS symptoms when compared to sham. Acupressure may reduce the number of women having moderate to severe PMS symptoms when compared to sham acupressure. There was not enough evidence to determine the safety of acupuncture or acupressure. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low.The main limitations were imprecision due to small sample sizes (too few women in the study) and risk of bias related to blinding (where researchers or participants knew what treatment they were getting).
The evidence is current to October 2013. We included studies in children (age > 28 days and < 18 years) and adult patients (age > 18 years) of either gender who received mannitol or hypertonic saline during craniotomy for brain tumour. We reran the search in January 2017 and found five potential studies of interest which have been added to a list of ‘Studies Awaiting Classification' and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update. We found six studies with 527 participants.
Three studies reported the level of brain relaxation. Hypertonic saline may provide better brain relaxation than mannitol.
The length of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay was reported by one study.
No study reported on the effects of mannitol and hypertonic saline on mortality, the condition of the patient three months after the operation or patient quality of life. Based on our results, we would expect that of 100 patients who received hypertonic saline during surgery, around 22 patients would fail to have adequate brain relaxation compared with 36 patients given mannitol. The quality of evidence for brain relaxation with use of hypertonic saline is low. Further research is needed to assess more important issues such as long-term mortality, long-term outcomes, adverse events and quality of life with use of the two fluids.
Over five months, fewer people using a LAMA required oral steroids for an asthma attack, and their lung function was improved over that of patients taking inhaled steroids alone. It looked as though people taking LAMA might be less likely to have to go to the hospital for an asthma attack or for another 'serious adverse event', but we couldn't be sure because the studies were short, and these things did not happen very often in either group. A LAMA added to an inhaled steroid did not appear to improve people's quality of life or control of asthma symptoms.
There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone. In the one controlled study that met inclusion criteria, 60 outpatients were randomised to one of three groups that received two sequential depot injections of naltrexone (192 or 384 mg) or placebo injections. The mean dropout time was 48 days with high dose naltrexone compared with 27 days on placebo; an increase in 
treatment of 21 days (range 11 to 31 days). The lower depot dose gave a lesser benefit. The number retained in treatment at eight weeks did not show a clear difference and ranged from a mean of 68% to 39% of participants in 
the different groups. 'Wanting heroin' did not differ on naltrexone but 'needing heroin' scored significantly lower with depot naltrexone compared to placebo. The most prominent adverse effects were general symptoms of 
fatigue and pain at the injection site. Seventeen reports met inclusion criteria for assessing adverse effects. Seven looked specifically at naltrexone implants for treatment of opioid dependence and wound infection, allergic reaction to the implant and number of implants removed. The majority of the trials did not have a control group and systematic assessment of adverse effects was lacking.
This review found that while initial treatment with chemotherapy rather than endocrine therapy may be associated with a higher response rate, the two initial treatments had a similar effect on overall survival. No single group of patients who might benefit from or be harmed by one treatment over the other were identified, although there was little information to address this question. Six of the seven fully published trials commented on increased toxicity associated with chemotherapy including nausea, vomiting and alopecia. Three of the seven trials mentioned aspects of quality of life but their findings provided differing results. Only one trial formally measured quality of life (QOL), concluding that QOL was better with chemotherapy. Based on these trials, no conclusions can be made as to the QOL achieved with either treatment.
Accurate information about hormone receptor status is now routinely available for many women with metastatic breast cancer, and hormonal treatments have improved in their effectiveness in the last 10 years. In women with metastatic breast cancer where hormone receptors are present, a policy of treating first with endocrine therapy rather than chemotherapy appears to be better, on the basis of the trials and outcomes in this review, except in the presence of rapidly progressive disease.
We included 15 trials (3663 women). All the trials compared immersion in water with no immersion in water: eight during the first stage of labour, two during the second stage of labour (waterbirth) only, four during the first and second stages of labour, and one early versus late immersion during the first stage of labour. The evidence was of moderate to very low quality. No trial compared immersion in water with other forms of pain management.
Water immersion during the first stage of labour probably results in fewer women having an epidural, but probably makes little or no difference to the number of women who have a normal vaginal birth, instrumental birth, caesarean section or a serious perineal tear. We are uncertain about the effect on the amount of blood loss after birth because the quality of the evidence was very low. Labouring in water also may make little or no difference to babies being admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or developing infections. Stillbirths and baby deaths were not reported.
Two trials compared water immersion during the second stage (birth) with no immersion. We found that immersion may make little or no difference in numbers of women who have a normal vaginal birth. It is uncertain whether immersion makes any difference to instrumental vaginal births, caesarean sections, numbers of babies admitted to NICU, babies' temperatures at birth and fever in babies during the first week, because the quality of the evidence was found to be very low for all of these outcomes. Epidurals were not relevant to this stage of labour. Serious perineal tears and blood loss after birth were not reported in either trial.
Only one trial (200 women) compared women who got into the water early and late in their labour but there was not enough information to show any clear differences between the groups. Labouring in water may reduce the number of women having an epidural. Giving birth in water did not appear to affect mode of birth, or the number of women having a serious perineal tear. This review found no evidence that labouring in water increases the risk of an adverse outcome for women or their newborns. The trials varied in quality and further research is needed particularly for waterbirth and its use in birth settings outside hospital labour wards before we can be more certain of these effects. Research is also needed about women’s and caregivers experiences of labour and birth in water.
ICBT with therapist support was significantly more effective than no treatment (waiting list) at improving anxiety and reducing symptoms. The quality of the evidence was low to moderate.
There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of ICBT with therapist support and unguided CBT, though the quality of the evidence was very low. Patient satisfaction was generally reported to be higher with therapist-supported ICBT, however patient satisfaction was not formally assessed.
ICBT with therapist support may not differ in effectiveness as compared to face-to-face CBT. The quality of the evidence was low.
There was a low risk of bias in the included studies, except for blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessment. Adverse events were rarely reported in the studies.
We found 12 studies of corticosteroid treatment in DMD, involving a total of 667 randomised boys; two other studies are ongoing. Among the 12 completed studies, the treatments were: a corticosteroid versus inactive medicine (placebo) (in nine trials); daily versus weekend-only prednisone (in one trial); and deflazacort versus prednisone (in three trials). Some studies included more than one comparison; some were not fully reported or provided results that could not be analysed. One trial, a two-year study comparing a corticosteroid (deflazacort) with placebo, assessed the effects of corticosteroids on the ability to continue walking, but the data were not suitable for analysis. Most studies did not report ability to continue walking.
At the usual 0.75 mg/kg/day dose, corticosteroids improved muscle strength and function over six months compared to placebo. These results are based on combined data (up to 152 participants) from four trials, which provided moderate quality evidence. Improvements were seen in timed tests (eg. timed walk or run, time to stand, stair climb), ability to lift weights, a leg function grade, and a measure of the strength of muscles used in breathing. Evidence from single trials showed 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone to be superior to 0.3 mg/kg/day on most strength and function tests, with little evidence of greater benefit at 1.5 mg/kg/day. Changes in appearance and hair growth were more common at 0.75 mg/kg/day than 0.3 mg/kg/day.
One RCT (n = 66) also reported better strength, function and quality of life at 12 months with daily 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone. The two-year RCT, which had 28 participants, showed that deflazacort stabilised muscle strength for up to two years compared to placebo. This study did not show benefit on timed tests at two years; however, these results are imprecise and at high risk of bias, with less than half the original participants contributing data.
One trial found that changes in muscle strength and function were similar with daily and weekend-only prednisone regimens over a 12-month period (low to moderate quality evidence).
Two small RCTs compared daily prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day with daily deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day, but trial methods did not allow comparisons of muscle strength or function.
Previous versions of this review have found adverse events such as excessive weight gain, abnormal behaviour, changes in appearance, and abnormal hair growth to be more common with corticosteroids than with placebo. We assessed the quality of evidence for abnormal behaviour and weight gain for this review and found it to be moderate. The newer study of daily versus weekend-only prednisone showed that both groups gained weight. The body mass index (BMI; a measure of weight for height) did not show any clear difference between the regimens (low quality evidence). The weekend-only group had a greater increase in height. According to very low quality evidence from two studies, deflazacort appeared to cause less weight gain at one year than prednisone, and no significant difference in numbers with behaviour change. Data were insufficient to assess the risk of fractures or cataracts.
The evidence is up to date to February 2016.
We found 14 studies comparing hypnotherapy with other approaches to help people stop smoking (including brief advice, or more intensive stop-smoking counselling), or no treatment. Overall, 1926 people were included. Studies lasted at least six months. The studies varied greatly in terms of the treatments they compared, so it was difficult to combine their results. We searched for evidence up to 18 July 2018. When we combined the results of six studies (with a total of 957 people) there was no evidence that hypnotherapy helped people quit smoking more than behavioural interventions, such as counselling, when delivered over the same amount of time. There was also no evidence that there was a difference between hypnotherapy and longer counselling programmes when we combined results from two studies (269 people). One study compared hypnotherapy with no treatment and found an effect in favour of hypnotherapy, but the study was small (40 people) and had issues with its methods, which means we cannot be certain about this finding. Most of the studies did not say if they also evaluated the safety of hypnotherapy. Five studies looked at adding hypnotherapy to existing treatments and found an effect, but the studies were at high risk of bias and there were large, unexplained differences in their findings. One study that compared hypnotherapy and relaxation found no difference in side effects. The evidence in this review ranges from low to very low certainty, as there was not enough information and many of the studies had issues with their designs.
There is no clear evidence that hypnotherapy is better than other approaches in helping people to stop smoking. If a benefit is present, current evidence suggests the benefit is small at most. Larger, high-quality studies are needed.
We found 34 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3244 women that compared traditional slings with drugs or other types of surgery (colposuspension, mid-urethral slings, bladder neck needle suspension, single-incision slings (mini-slings); one type of traditional sling with another; and traditional slings with injectables. All trials included women with SUI, but some also involved women with UUI, who are said to have MUI.
We did not find any studies comparing suburethral slings with no treatment or sham treatment, conservative management such as pelvic floor exercises, anterior repair, or laparoscopic colposuspension. Few trialists reported who had funded their work. Surgery appears to work better than drugs for treating urinary incontinence. Some evidence suggests that women had less leakage with traditional slings in the medium term (one to five years) compared with those undergoing colposuspension (a major abdominal operation), and fewer needed repeat surgery in one trial. However, information about adverse effects is lacking. It is not clear whether traditional slings were better or worse than mid-urethral slings (synthetic tape) in the medium term, but one small trial showed that women who had a traditional sling might have less leakage 10 years later. It is not clear whether traditional slings were better or worse than injectable treatment, bladder neck needle suspension, or mini-slings. We found insufficient information about different types of slings compared with each other, except that slings made of porcine dermis (Pelvicol) were more likely to fail than other materials. Slings made of non-absorbable synthetic Goretex involved more complications. Many trials were small and used different ways of measuring success, which made combining information difficult. The quality of evidence for most outcomes was judged to be low or very low. This means that most of our conclusions about traditional slings are uncertain. Some evidence suggests that women had less leakage with traditional slings in the medium term (one to five years) compared with those undergoing colposuspension (a major abdominal operation), and fewer needed repeat surgery in one trial. Evidence on comparison of traditional suburethral slings with other treatments is insufficient. Three eligible economic evaluations reported similar results, but they are not directly comparable because of differences in their methods. This review is confined to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and therefore may not identify all of the adverse effects that may be associated with these procedures.
We included seven studies involving a total of 403 participants. The evidence is current to May 2016. There were variations among the included studies. Two of the studies were placebo controlled, while the rest compared one drug to another drug. Two studies compared two systemic drugs against each other; two studies compared two local drugs against each other; and the fifth study compared a systemic drug against a local drug. The results for the studies varied, meaning that we could make no clear conclusions. The two studies that used a placebo as a control provided conflicting results; when the results were combined we identified a slight benefit in favour of the treatment group. These two studies provided clear evidence that taking the treatment drug was likely to result in an increased risk of having an adverse event. This review identified a lack of studies and subsequent evidence relating to the use of pharmacological interventions (with the exception of botulinum toxin) to treat spasticity. Future research to identify the best time to start treatment and the optimal dose for treatment is recommended. The quality of the evidence varied. We judged all but one of the studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one of the six areas considered. The sample sizes in the included studies were relatively low for drug trials; three of the seven studies had 30 or fewer participants.
We searched for trials up to June 2014 and included 21 randomised controlled trials, involving 1746 participants, of mailuoning for people with acute ischaemic stroke. Two trials followed up participants for three months after treatment ended, but the duration of the other trials was shorter, from 14 to 38 days. A government agency funded one of the 21 included trials. We assessed 20 trials to be of a low quality. When we analysed these trials together, there was no significant difference for adverse events between the mailuoning-treatment group and the control group; mailuoning improved neurological impairment and cognitive function significantly. One trial, assessed to be of a higher quality, failed to show any significant improvement made by mailuoning on neurological deficit, activities of daily life, or quality of life. There was no convincing evidence from trials with sufficient methodological quality to support the routine use of mailuoning to promote recovery after stroke. High-quality large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm its effect. We assessed 20 of the 21 included trials to be of a poor quality for their study design; we assessed one trial to be of a higher quality, but there were fewer participants in this trial. Overall, the quality of evidence was poor.
This review examines the efficacy and safety of the use of various Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus. We found seven trials which included 354 participants (172 on treatment, 158 on control, 24 could not be classified). All these studies included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Six studies tested five different types of herbal mixtures (proprietary drugs) and only one tested 'whole system' Ayurvedic treatment. The duration of treatment ranged from three to six months. One study each of Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels at the end of the treatment period compared to controls. Two studies of Diabecon, and one study of Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower fasting blood sugar levels at the end of the study period in the treatment group. No deaths were observed in these trials and side effects did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups. One study of Pancreas tonic reported no significant change in health-related quality of life. No study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and costs. Despite positive results in some studies, and absence of serious side effects, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to weak methods and small number of participants in the evaluated studies. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of these treatments. Ayurvedic physicians generally use a mixture of various herbs or proprietary preparations along with diet, exercise and mode of living. The treatments are usually individualised taking into account the balance of three 'doshas'. It is possible that the interventions in the trials analysed have not replicated actual Ayurvedic practice but only assessed some components individually.
This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group and the evidence is current up to 9 November 2012.
In this review there are no trials published between 1950 and 2012 in which patients were randomly treated with either fixed braces, removable retainers or no treatment. No trials were found that were suitable for inclusion in this review. Currently there is no evidence to support using one form of treatment for managing relapse over another.
We found only two studies that compared using a feeding tube to an intravenous catheter for children hospitalised with bronchiolitis. The studies included 810 children in total who were younger than two years of age, and who were randomly assigned to either a feeding tube or an intravenous catheter. The authors of the Oakley trial indicated that the study was funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, Samuel Nissen Charitable Foundation (Perpetual), Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, and the Victorian Government, but that the funders had no role in the design and interpretation of the trial. The Kugelman trial did not describe the study funder. The two studies found no differences in the number of hours children stayed in hospital, nor were there any differences in recovery time to resume full oral feeding. The main difference between groups was greater success in inserting a feeding tube on first try compared to an intravenous catheter, which often required several attempts. Also, children who received intravenous fluid were more prone to switching to an enteral tube feeding and experienced more side effects. One of the studies reported that parents were satisfied with both hydration methods. However, because there were only two included studies, it is hard to tell if enteral tube feeding is better or worse than intravenous fluids. There is a need for more specific research on this topic, including a better understanding of parent and caregiver preferences related to giving non-oral fluids and how to incorporate shared decision-making, where both patient and doctor work together to make treatment decisions. In one study, the methods used to randomly assign and allocate participants to treatment groups were unclear. It was unclear how this may have caused bias in the study. As one study had an unclear risk of bias, we rated the overall certainty of evidence for the primary outcome as moderate.  None of the study authors declared any conflict of interest.
We considered the quality of the evidence to be very low because there was a high risk of bias in the trial results, because the results were so imprecise, and because several outcomes measured in the trial were not fully reported. Doctors and patients should be aware of the limitations of the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of this operation for iNPH. There should be more and larger trials to compare the different treatment options.
This is a summary of a Cochrane Review on interventions for the management of tophi. The literature was searched up to 28 August 2020. We reported five studies on pharmacological interventions. Participants were from a wide range of countries, including the USA, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and locations in Europe. All studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies.  Resolution of tophi
33 more people out of 100 had resolution of one or more tophi after six months' treatment with pegloticase biweekly (every 2 weeks) compared with placebo (16% better to 50% better).
40 out of 100 people had tophi resolution with pegloticase.
7 out of 100 people had tophi resolution with placebo.
Total adverse events:
1 more person out of 100 had an adverse event with pegloticase compared with placebo (9% fewer to 7% more).
95 out of 100 people had an adverse event with pegloticase.
94 out of 100 people had an adverse event with placebo. Resolution of tophi
14 more people out of 100 had resolution of one or more tophi after six months' treatment with pegloticase monthly compared with placebo (1% worse to 29% better).
21 out of 100 people had tophi resolution with pegloticase.
7 out of 100 people had tophi resolution with placebo.
Total adverse events
5 more people out of 100 had an adverse event with pegloticase compared with placebo (20% fewer to 12% more).
100 out of 100 people had an adverse event with pegloticase.
95 out of 100 people had an adverse event with placebo. Resolution of tophi
11 fewer people out of 100 had complete resolution of target tophus after 12 month's treatment with lesinurad 200 mg plus allopurinol versus alopurinol alone (28% worse to 6% better).
21 out of 100 people had tophi resolution with lesinurad 200 mg plus allopurinol.
32 out of 100 people had tophi resolution with allopurinol.
7 fewer people out of 100 had complete resolution of target tophus after 12 month's treatment with lesinurad 400 mg combination versus allopurinol alone (25% worse to 11% better).
25 out of 100 people had tophi resolution with lesinurad 400 mg plus allopurinol.
32 out of 100 people had tophi resolution with allopurinol. Resolution of tophi
7 more people out of 100 had complete resolution of target tophus after 12 month's treatment with lesinurad 400 mg versus lesinurad 200 mg, both in combination with febuxostat (10% fewer to 23% more).
66 out of 100 people had tophi resolution with lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat.
59 out of 100 people had tophi resolution with lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat.
Number of participant withdrawals due to adverse events
Only one study reported on adverse events separately in participants with tophi.
9 more people out of 100 withdrew due to adverse events after 12 month's treatment with lesinurad 400 mg versus lesinurad 200 mg, both in combination with febuxostat (3% less to 43% better).
70 out of 100 people with lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat withdrew from the study.
61 out of 100 people with lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat withdrew from the study.
Total adverse events
15 more people out of 100 had one or more adverse event after 12 month's treatment with lesinurad 400 mg versus lesinurad 200 mg, both in combination with febuxostat (3% less to 18% better).
97 out of 100 people had an adverse event with lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat.
82 out of 100 people had an adverse event with lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat. Moderate-certainty evidence indicated that pegloticase biweekly or monthly probably resolves one or more tophi. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that lesinurad (400 mg or 200 mg) in combination with allopurinol is probably not beneficial for resolution of tophi in gout. Low-certainty evidence indicated that lesinurad 400 mg compared to lesinurad 200 mg (both in combination with febuxostat) may resolve tophi and may result in no difference in adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events. However, this study did not have a placebo arm.
Of the two good quality studies identified, one showed no evidence that collaboration between local services improved health and the other showed a modest improvement in some areas. Of the remaining studies, where health benefits were reported these were often modest, inconsistent with other findings and could have been the result of additional funding or resources. Two out of three studies looking at environmental changes reported some health benefits.
These findings show that when comparing local collaborative partnerships between health and government agencies with standard working arrangements, there is generally no difference in health outcomes.
We found 33 studies, involving 25,827 babies, that assessed any type of skin intervention. The included studies took place in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the USA, most often at children's hospitals. Skin care was compared against no skin care or usual skin care for babies in that country. Treatment and follow-up times ranged from 24 hours to three years. Many studies (13) tested the use of moisturisers; the other studies mainly tested the use of bathing and cleansing products and how often they were used.
Of the 33 included studies, only 11 studies had comparable outcomes of eczema, food allergy, or adverse effects and were combined for analysis. All of these studies enrolled babies before they were one month old, and  eight of these studies included babies thought to be at high risk for developing eczema. Compared to no skin care or standard care, moisturisers:
• probably do not change the chance of developing eczema by age one to three years (7 studies; 3075 babies), or the time needed for eczema to develop (9 studies; 3349 babies);
• may increase the chance of developing a food allergy as judged by a researcher (1 study; 976 babies) by age one to three years;
• may slightly increase the number of immediate reactions to a common food allergen at two years, as reported by parents (1 study; 1171 babies);
• probably cause more skin infections (6 studies; 2728 babies);
• may increase unwanted effects, such as a stinging feeling or an allergic reaction to moisturisers (4 studies; 343 babies);
• may increase the chance of babies slipping (4 studies; 2538 babies);
• may not affect the chance of developing sensitivity to food allergens (3 studies; 1797 babies) by age one to three years. We are moderately confident in our results for developing eczema and the time needed to develop eczema. We are less confident about our results for food allergy or sensitivity, which are based on small numbers of studies with widely varying results. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. Our confidence in the review findings for skin infections is moderate, but low for stinging or allergic reactions and slipping.
Data from six studies were combined in the analysis. All participants (including adults and children) were previously taking at least one antiepileptic medicine and all were continuing to have seizures. Either gabapentin (an antiepileptic medicine) or a placebo (a tablet that contains no medicine) was added to the medicine regimen. The results showed that gabapentin effectively reduced seizures when used as an additional treatment. Compared to a placebo, gabapentin was almost twice as likely to reduce seizures by 50% or more. The most common side effects associated with gabapentin were ataxia (poor co-ordination and unsteady gait), dizziness, fatigue and drowsiness. Overall, the quality of evidence was low to moderate as information was not reported for all participants in some of the trials and some of the results were imprecise. Research is needed into the effects of the long-term use of gabapentin, and to compare gabapentin with other add-on medicines.
The evidence is current to 11 August 2020.
We wanted to find out which "disease-modifying" drugs work best to make people with multiple sclerosis feel better and, at the same time, are well tolerated and have the fewest unwanted effects. In particular, we wanted to find out if any drug is better than the others in reducing the frequency of relapses and the worsening of disability, and if any drug is better tolerated than the others or causes fewer unwanted events. We searched thoroughly for studies comparing any "disease-modifying" drug with another drug or with no treatment in adults (≥ 18 years old) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and number of participants involved and precision of the results. We found 50 studies with 36,541 people with multiple sclerosis (68.6% female and 31.4% male) treated with a "disease-modifying" drug for at least one year. The biggest study included 2,244 people; the smallest included 19 people. The studies were conducted all over the world, mostly in the USA and Europe. Most studies lasted 12 or 24 months; only eight studies lasted more than 24 months. Most studies were performed by pharmaceutical companies in order to obtain authorisation from regulatory authorities for marketing the studied drug. Twenty-five studies compared a "disease-modifying" drug with no treatment; the other studies compared two different types of "disease-modifying" drugs. We are highly confident that natalizumab, cladribine and alemtuzumab are more effective than most drugs in reducing the frequency of relapses after two years of treatment. We are moderately confident that natalizumab is also likely to be effective in slowing the worsening of disability after two years of treatment. We are moderately confident that people taking fingolimod, teriflunomide, glatiramer acetate, interferon beta-1a, laquinimod, natalizumab and daclizumab are more likely to discontinue the drug because of unwanted effects. Our confidence in the desirable and undesirable effects of "disease-modifying" drugs is limited, mainly because the evidence is based on few cases of relapses and worsening of disability, and because we were concerned that the interests of pharmaceutical companies may have influenced the reporting of the study results. The evidence is up-to-date until August 8, 2022.
We included 4745 participants from 21 trials who received iron injections, iron tablets or no treatment. Clinical settings of these trials included loss of blood, cancer, anaemia before surgery for various reasons and heart failure, among others. Most trials included participants with mild to moderate anaemia and excluded participants who were allergic to iron therapy. Comparisons between iron tablets and no treatment revealed no evidence of clinical benefit in terms of a decrease in death or in quality of life. However, a reduction in the proportion of participants who required blood transfusion was noted among those who received iron tablets versus no treatment. Haemoglobin levels were higher in participants receiving iron tablets versus no treatment. With regards to iron injections, haemoglobin levels were higher after iron injections compared with levels reported after iron tablets or no treatment, but no evidence showed clinical benefit in terms of a decrease in death, in the number of participants requiring blood transfusion or in quality of life of participants. Although the average amount of blood transfused was less in the iron injection group than in the iron tablet group, only one trial reported this outcome, introducing significant doubt about this finding. Differences in serious complications between people who received iron versus no treatment were imprecise. No trials reported severe allergic reactions due to iron injections, suggesting that these are rare. Most of the adverse events related to iron tablet treatment were mild; effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and constipation were reported. Comparisons of the clinical benefit of one iron preparation over another were imprecise. We were unable to determine whether iron is useful in specific clinical situations because available information was not clearly presented. In summary, no evidence is currently available to support the routine use of iron injections in adult anaemic men and or in adult non-pregnant anaemic women who have not just given birth to a baby. Iron tablets might be useful in anaemic adult men and adult women who can tolerate the side effects. No evidence suggests any advantage of one iron preparation over another. Additional randomised controlled trials are required to determine whether iron treatment decreases death and blood transfusion requirements and improves quality of life. Such trials should be appropriately designed and should include a sufficiently large number of participants, to decrease the chance of erroneous conclusions.
This review compared initial ICS doses for asthma . The results showed that commencing with a moderate dose ICS is as effective as commencing with a high dose ICS and then reducing the dose whilst monitoring symptoms. These results also show that initial moderate dose ICS maybe more effective than initial low dose ICS. No extra benefit was gained by doubling or quadrupling the starting ICS dose. People with asthma should start their treatment with low to moderate doses of ICS.
This review systematically examines the evidence to see how effective chlorpromazine is at reducing aggression or agitation due to psychosis. From the evidence available, we are unable to draw any firm conclusion about using this medicine for this purpose. We found that chlorpromazine was just as effective at reducing aggression or agitation due to psychosis as similar medicines, but that it may be associated with more side effects than other medicines. Further research is needed to clarify whether chlorpromazine is effective at reducing psychosis induced aggression or agitation. Such research would be best carried out using carefully designed clinical trials.
One 26-week randomised controlled study (45 participants) was included in the review. Participants were aged between six and 43 years old. The study was carried out in several centres around the world. Participants either received an intravenous infusion of laronidase 0.58 mg/kg or a placebo ('dummy' infusion). Current evidence is limited because we only found one randomised clinical trial in the medical literature, which did not include very many participants. Compared with placebo, enzyme replacement therapy improved lung function, the individuals’ ability to walk, reduced the excretion of abnormal glycosaminoglycans (a type of carbohydrate molecule) in the urine and also reduced the stopping of breathing related to sleep. Adverse reactions in relation to the infusions occurred in both groups but all were mild and none required medical intervention or for the infusions to be stopped. Enzyme replacement therapy can be used before and around the time of stem cell transplant, which is now the gold standard treatment for Hurler syndrome in individuals diagnosed before the age of two and a half years. More studies are needed to look at the long-term effects of this treatment and also to see the effects on the quality of life of these individuals. We do not anticipate any further trials to be undertaken and therefore do not plan to update this review. The included study was small and of low quality.
Each study included in this review looked at a different intervention to reduce pain in mammography. The trial results show that giving women written or verbal information about the procedure prior to the mammogram can reduce pain or discomfort of the examination. Also increasing women's control of breast compression could reduce the pain they experience, though there was no change in the pain women experienced when a mammography-technologist reduced the compression force. Use of breast cushions also reduced the pain; however, it caused a poor quality of X-ray in 2% of women screened, which meant that they would need to have a further mammogram. Paracetamol taken before the procedure did not change the pain the women experienced.
Further research is needed on interventions to relieve the pain and discomfort of screening mammography.
One hundred and ninety-five intervention studies of 12296 individuals lasting three to 1100 days were included, which evaluated at least one of the effect measures. Participants were healthy or had elevated blood pressure. Longitudinal studies have shown that the effect of reduced salt intake on BP is stable after at maximum seven days and population studies have shown that very few people eat more than 14.5 g salt per day. Therefore, we also performed subgroup analyses of 131 studies with a duration of at least seven days and a salt intake of maximum 14.5 g. Only six studies were supported by food industry organisations. The mean salt intake was reduced from 11.5 g per day to 3.8 g per day. The reduction in SBP/DBP in people with normal blood pressure was 1.1/0 mmHg (about 0.3%) , and in people with hypertension 5.7/2.9 mmHg (about 3%). In contrast, the effect on hormones and lipids were similar in people with normotension and hypertension. Renin increased 55%; aldosterone increased 127%; adrenalin increased 14%; noradrenalin increased 27%; cholesterol increased 2.9%; and triglyceride increased 6.3%. Only randomised controlled trials were included and the grade of evidence was therefore considered to be high, although downgraded in some of the smaller analyses.
This systematic review was aimed at determining whether any medical treatment decreased blood loss and decreased allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver resections. This systematic review included six trials with 849 patients. All trials had high risk of bias ('systematic error') as well of play of chance ('random error'). The trials included comparison of medicines (such as aprotinin, desmopressin, recombinant factor VIIa, antithrombin III, and tranexamic acid) with controls (no medicines). There was no difference in the death or complications due to surgery or long-term survival in any of the comparisons. Fewer patients required transfusion of blood donated by others when aprotinin or tranexamic acid were compared to controls not receiving the interventions. The other comparisons did not decrease the transfusion requirements. However, there is a high risk of type I errors (erroneously concluding that an intervention is beneficial when it is actually not beneficial) and type II errors (erroneously concluding that an intervention is not beneficial when it is actually beneficial) because of the few trials included and the small sample size in each trial as well as the inherent risk of bias (systematic errors). Aprotinin and tranexamic acid show promise in the reduction of blood transfusion requirements in liver resections. Further randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias (systematic errors) and low risk of play of chance (random errors) which assess clinically important outcomes (such as death and complications due to operation) are necessary to assess any pharmacological interventions aimed at decreasing blood transfusion and blood transfusion requirements in liver resections. Trials need to be designed to assess the effect of a combination of different interventions in liver resections.
We searched for trials on 11 May 2017. We included 70 studies though only 61 studies involving more than 8000 women contributed data to the review. All of the trials were conducted in hospital settings, on healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies at 37 to 42 weeks' gestation. The trials compared an opioid (intramuscular or intravenous) with placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, another opioid (or in three trials another medication or inhaled nitrous oxide) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in 34 different comparisons. There were few opportunities to pool the findings, and for many outcomes only one trial contributed findings. The quality of the evidence was mainly assessed as low or very low for the outcomes of pain in labour and satisfaction with analgesia. Many of the studies included insufficient numbers of women to detect differences between groups. Overall, our findings indicate that opioids provided some pain relief during labour, although substantial proportions of women still reported moderate or severe pain. Opioid drugs were associated with nausea, vomiting and drowsiness, with different types of opioids causing different side effects. We did not have sufficient evidence to assess which opioid drug provided the best pain relief with the least adverse effects. Nor did we find clear evidence of adverse effects of opioids on the newborn. Maternal satisfaction with opioid analgesia appeared moderate although it was often unreported or reported in different ways. We did not have sufficient evidence to assess which opioid drugs women were most satisfied with.
In this review we did not examine the effectiveness and safety of intramuscular or intravenous opioids compared with other methods of pain relief in labour such as epidural analgesia. The review needs to be examined alongside related Cochrane reviews. As injected opioid drugs are so widely used it is important that more research is carried out so that women can make informed choices about pain relief.
We looked for studies that included adult men and women who were current smokers and had a diagnosis of COPD. We included studies that assessed the effectiveness of any behavioural support or medication, or both as an aid to quit smoking. We included studies that compared different types of treatment or compared treatment to stop smoking with no treatment or 'usual care'. We only included studies that reported how many people had stopped smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We carried out the most recent search for studies in March 2016. We found high-quality evidence from a collection of four (1,540 participants) of the total 16 included studies (13,123 participants) in this review. Overall, we found evidence that smokers with COPD who receive a combination of high-intensity behavioural support and medication are more than twice as likely to quit as people who receive behavioural support alone. We found no clear evidence that one particular form of behavioural support or medication is better than another. It is still unclear whether smokers with COPD are different from smokers without COPD with regard to which treatments work best to help them stop smoking. We are quite confident in the finding that a combination of behavioural support and medication works better than behavioural support alone. However, we were not able to combine the results of many of the studies because the treatments or the outcomes of the studies were too different from each other.
We searched for studies that investigated the effects of speed of injection on the amount of pain and bruising where the injection is given (current to 22 June 2020). Five studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The included studies took place in Thailand, Turkey, Italy, and China, and enrolled a total of 503 people (312 female and 191 male participants). All study participants received LMWH, whilst no study used UFH.
Study investigators injected heparin into the abdomen of participants. Participants could watch the injection being given and knew whether it was fast (10 seconds long) or slow (30 seconds long).
We found that pain may be slightly reduced 48 hours after slow injection compared with fast injection. Similarly, there may be smaller bruise sizes and fewer bruises with the slow injection 48 and 60 hours after the injection. None of the included studies measured the number or size of haematomas. We graded the certainty of the evidence as low or very low because we found only a small number of published studies that reported on our review question, and the studies were small and had contradicting results. The fact that participants knew whether they had received a fast or a slow injection may also have affected the results because this knowledge may have led them to use different techniques (i.e. applying cold, heat, or massage) to relieve the pain and bruising based on the intervention received.
We found one new study for this update. In total, we included 12 studies with 2422 people. Five studies included ICU patients, two studies included cancer patients, and the remaining studies included miscellaneous patients (haemodialysis, home care patients, etc.). We cannot conclude that locking catheters with heparin prevents blocking better than flushing with normal saline. We saw little or no difference in the length of time the catheter remained unblocked or in the numbers of side effects between heparin or saline use. When comparing heparin with saline, the certainty of the evidence of the results ranged from very low to low due to the design of the studies and because the overall result included the likelihood of both benefit and harm. This Cochrane review updates our previous evidence. The evidence is current to 20 October 2021.
We conducted a wide search for reports of clinical trials of treatments for nerve damage in leprosy. We found five clinical trials that met our criteria, involving 576 people with leprosy. Two of the included trials compared prednisolone with placebo. One of these trials, with 84 participants, recruited people who had mild abnormality of feeling of less than six months' duration and the other, with 95 participants, assessed treatment effects in people with abnormal nerve function of 6 to 24 months' duration. A third trial, with 334 participants, compared three 12-month corticosteroid regimens for severe type 1 reactions. Type 1 reactions are episodes in which nerves become inflamed. The fourth trial (21 participants) compared a low dose of prednisone with a high dose of prednisone for people with damage to the ulnar nerve (a nerve in the arm). The fifth trial (42 participants) compared intravenous methylprednisolone and oral prednisolone with intravenous normal saline and oral prednisolone in people with a type 1 leprosy reaction or abnormal nerve function of no more than six months' duration. There was no important difference in improvement in nerve function between people treated with prednisolone or with placebo after one year, according to two trials. More people on a three-month course of prednisolone failed to respond to treatment and required extra corticosteroids compared to people on either a high-dose or a low-dose regimen of five months' duration. The trials comparing corticosteroids with placebo and a trial comparing intravenous methylprednisolone and oral prednisolone with intravenous normal saline and oral prednisolone found no differences in the occurrence of adverse events between groups. We considered the quality of the evidence to be moderate to low. Although trials were well conducted and designed, they were largely small and did not always use proven measures to capture the effects of corticosteroids.
The evidence in this review is up to date to June 2015.
Our review included 10 studies (830 participants, 1387 eyes) published between 1998 and 2012. Nine of these studies investigated the ability of OCT to diagnose CSMO.
Study funding sources
There were no overt declarations of potential conflicts of interest in terms of the manufacturer of the OCT device being involved in funding the research.
Key results
We found that OCT retinal thickness measurement is not sufficiently accurate to detect CSMO, involving the centre of the macula, using clinical fundus examination as the reference standard. Of 10 patients with diabetic retinopathy, 5 of whom have CSMO, 1 of 5 with no CSMO would be wrongly diagnosed as having CSMO, and about 1 of 5 with CSMO would be missed.
However, researchers have found that disagreements between OCT and clinical examination occur because OCT can detect early, subclinical retinal thickening in people without CSMO and more advanced retinopathy. They suggested that such cases of subclinical macular oedema are followed more closely, since they are at increased risk of progression to CSMO. Furthermore, OCT is an essential tool to manage antiangiogenic therapy in patients with DMO and is believed by many to be a new reference standard for its diagnosis.
Quality of the evidence
Study quality was often unclear because of incomplete reporting or because it was at risk of bias. Specifically, this concerned how patients were selected in the study, who referred them and how, and exclusion of those for whom poor quality images were obtained. Furthermore, many studies included both patient's eyes, which is a problem in data analyses.
We searched the medical literature for studies that compared fornix and limbal-based techniques for adults with glaucoma. Next, we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all relevant studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence based on the factors such as how studies were conducted and how many people were included. We found six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 361 adults with any type of glaucoma. They were followed-up at least 24 months.
- Failure rate at 24 months was not reported in any included studies, and one study reported "late complications" but did not specify a time period, which favoured the fornix-based treatment (our confidence in this evidence was low).
- No difference was noted with respect to lowering eye pressure after 24 months (two studies) and after 12 months (four studies)(moderate confidence).
- The number of medications needed to control eye pressure after surgery was also similar (high confidence).
- Most of the studies reported that the complication rates after the operation were similar except in one complication which was narrowing in the anterior part of the eye after the procedure (more common in the limbal surgery group), but this did not affect the final outcome of the surgery. We do not know whether fornix- or limbal-based trabeculectomy surgery is better in terms of benefits and risks due to a lack of robust evidence. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to March 2021.
This review included one randomised controlled study involving 135 women with mild pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and/or protein in the urine). There was not enough evidence from this study to determine the effects of magnesium sulphate on babies born at term. Women receiving magnesium sulphate were more likely to feel warm and flushed in this study than women who received a placebo, but they were not more likely to stop treatment due to side effects. The rates of haemorrhage after birth and rates of caesarean birth were similar for women who received magnesium sulphate and those who received a placebo.
More studies are needed to establish whether magnesium sulphate given to the mother at term is protective for the baby's brain. The babies in these trials should be followed up over a long period so that we can monitor the effects of magnesium on child development.
We are awaiting further information from another six studies so that they can be assessed.
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. We found ten studies on a total of 527 people with intermittent claudication. The studies compared supervised walking programmes against:
* exercises to strengthen the leg muscles (four studies);
* Nordic walking (three studies);
* cycling (one study);
* arm ergometry (pedalling with the arms on an exercise machine – one study);
* a combination of different types of exercise (four studies).
The programmes lasted between six and 24 weeks.
The evidence suggests that there may be little to no difference between supervised walking and other types of supervised exercise in terms of:
* the average maximum distance that people can walk after 12 weeks of exercise, or once they have completed the exercise programme;
* the average distance that people can walk without feeling pain after 12 weeks of exercise, or once they have completed the exercise programme; or
* disability (after 12 to 24 weeks of exercise).
We do not know if there is a difference in quality of life, since the studies that investigated this used different measurement tools to assess it, and we could not compare the results. This review suggests that supervised walking and other types of supervised exercise programmes may have similar effects on how far people with intermittent claudication can walk, and how far they can walk without pain. However, our confidence in this finding is limited, mainly because:
* the studies we reviewed were small;
* the types of supervised walking exercises that were evaluated varied across studies; and
* concerns about how some studies were conducted.
Future studies that use robust methods and include large numbers of people are needed to provide stronger evidence for comparing different types of supervised exercise programmes for intermittent claudication. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to March 2019.
No randomised trials involving pulmonary artery catheterisation were found and, thus, there is no robust data to support or disregard the use of this intervention. The complexity of this procedure and the skills needed to perform it may have affected the lack of randomised trials. Nevertheless, fluid management is still an important issue in managing and preventing kidney failure and accumulation of fluid in the lungs and other organs in the context of pre-eclampsia and pulmonary artery catheterisation is a potential technique for this. We think that further research, especially randomised trials, is needed.
A systematic review of benzodiazepine treatment of non-alcohol related delirium discovered very few trials (one randomized, controlled study of mechanically ventilated patients, and thus poorly reflective of delirious patients as a whole; and two partially controlled studies), the results of which indicate that at this time there is no evidence to support the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non-alcohol withdrawal related delirium among hospitalised patients.
We examined the available evidence up to 7 July 2015. Forty-seven studies, which included 5290 women, met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review. The mean age of participants in the studies varied from 27 to 57 years. We assessed over half of the included studies as at unclear risk of bias, 16 as high risk, and only five studies as low risk of bias. Funding was provided in 26 of the 47 studies, mainly by pharmaceutical companies. This Cochrane review found that minoxidil is more effective than placebo. In six studies, the proportion of women that experienced at least moderate hair regrowth was twice as high in the minoxidil group compared to the placebo group. This was confirmed by the investigators assessments in seven studies. In eight studies, there was an important increase in total hair count per cm² in the minoxidil group compared to the placebo group. QoL was only assessed in one study and it was unclear from the data if there was an important improvement. The number of adverse events was similar for both groups. These were mostly mild, consisting of itch, skin irritation, dermatitis, and additional hair growth on areas other than the scalp.
Four studies compared minoxidil (2%) to minoxidil (5%), but none of the studies indicated any benefit of the higher concentration over the lower concentration. The number of adverse events did not differ between the two groups. Minoxidil should not be used in pregnant or lactating women.
Three studies compared finasteride to placebo. Finasteride is only approved in men for treatment of hair loss as well as for enlarged prostate. In one of the three studies the opinion of both the participants and investigators were evaluated but finasteride was shown to be no more effective than placebo. Hair count improved only in the finasteride group in a small study with 12 participants, but not in the other two studies (219 participants). Adverse events were only addressed in one study and these were similar in both groups. The investigators of these studies did not assess QoL.
Laser comb therapy did not appear to be more effective than sham therapy according to the participants in two studies with 141 participants. Nonetheless an important increase in hair growth was reported in both these studies. QoL was not addressed, and adverse events were not reported per intervention group, making these data less usable.
Individual studies investigated most of the other interventions and comparisons, and we could not make any firm conclusions about the efficacy or safety of these other interventions.
Although it is generally acknowledged that renewed hair shedding occurs relatively soon after discontinuation of treatment, none of the included studies reported data on the sustainability of the treatment effect, nor on the possible impact of hair regrowth, reflected by a decrease in time spent by women on hair styling or the use of wigs. We rated the quality of evidence for most outcomes as moderate or low. The lower quality of evidence was mainly caused by risk of bias in studies (e.g. no blinding) or a small sample size making the results less precise.
The results of this systematic review suggest that pre-operative chemotherapy might increase survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer when compared to surgery alone. However, an individual patient data systematic review and meta-analysis is needed to give us a more reliable assessment of the size of benefits and to explore whether pre-operative chemotherapy may be more or less effective for particular types of patients.
We found one randomized controlled trial but it included both people with and without cystic fibrosis and we could not get the information specifically about individuals with cystic fibrosis so could not include the information in this review. Until the time when randomized controlled trial data is available for individuals with cystic fibrosis, clinicians should follow the current guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of lung infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria in the general population.
One study with a total of 28 participant was included in the review. This study compared two methods of splenectomy - laparoscopic (keyhole) versus an open surgical approach. Study participants were recruited over a period of 3.5 years, but participants were only followed up to the end of their hospital stay (usually less than one week). The study evaluated the two types of surgical methods. Only one of our three primary outcomes were reported, the number of people experiencing major adverse events (bleeding during and after the operation and complete or partial collapse of a lung). However, the amount of information available is not sufficient to draw any reliable conclusions (very-low quality evidence). Hence, we were unable to provide recommendations regarding the use of splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. Appropriate clinical judgement, in view of the various risks and benefits described by other lower quality sources of evidence (e.g. observational studies), may be necessary when considering splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. While we are satisfied that the participants had equal chances of undergoing either type of surgery, there is not enough information on other aspects of the study to make any overall judgement on its quality.
Our search for eligible studies conducted on 31 January 2016 revealed five studies, all comparing cup and bottle feeding in newborn infants, which we were able to include in this review. These studies were conducted in neonatal and maternity units in hospitals in Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Turkey. The mean gestational age of the infants in most of the studies were similar at the time of entry into the study. In four of the studies the intervention (cup or bottle) commenced from the time of enrolment into the study, when the infants first needed a supplemental feed and were as young as 30 weeks' gestation. In the study conducted in Turkey, supplemental feeding was not commenced on enrolment into the study and at the time of first supplemental feed but delayed until infants were at least 35 weeks of age. For some of the outcomes, the results of the different studies could not be combined. This included not breastfeeding at hospital discharge; not exclusively breastfeeding at three months and at six months; the average time taken for a feed; and the number of days spent in hospital. For each of these outcomes, the results from some studies favoured cup feeding, while the results from other studies favoured bottle feeding.
For some of the outcomes, the results of the different studies could be combined: there was no difference in weight gain or gestational age at discharge between those infants who recieved supplemental feeds by cup compared to bottle. However those infants who received supplemental feeds by cup were more likely to be exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge and were more likely to be receiving some breastfeeds at three and six months of age.
As the studies mostly included preterm infants and few term infants, no recommendations can be made for cup feeding term infants. The quality of evidence for weight gain, length of stay, not breastfeeding at hospital discharge and at six months of age and exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge and at six months of age is graded very low to low. In the studies included in this review, it is reported that many infants who were to receive supplemental feeds by cup received supplemental feeds by other means as either the parents or nurses did not like cup feeding.
This review did not find any evidence that lecithin does have a benefit for patients with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. However, one small study has observed a dramatic benefit of lecithin in people with subjective memory problems, but there are no similar studies with which to compare it.
The ABI test is non-invasive and inexpensive and is widely used clinically; therefore, we have reviewed all available reports obtained from a wide search of databases of medical literature to estimate its accuracy in identifying PAD in people who experience pain on walking that goes away after rest. Two review authors independently assessed studies that met inclusion criteria of the review, including use of a cross-sectional study design; enrolment of participants with pain on walking that got better with rest; and use of duplex ultrasonography or angiography to check that results of the ABI test were accurate. One study met our criteria and provided data from 85 participants (158 limbs). Investigators compared the manual doppler method of measuring ABI with the automated method. Researchers provided only data for legs as opposed to data for patients; we were therefore unable to recalculate the analysis at the whole-participant level.
In conclusion, we found little evidence about the accuracy of the ankle brachial index for diagnosing PAD in people presenting with exertional leg pain. The study included in our review had some flaws, and well-designed cross-sectional studies are needed to measure the accuracy of the ABI for diagnosing PAD in patients with early symptoms.
We reviewed 23 studies of different designs involving 188,934 young people and conducted in the United States, Canada and Australia. The studies tested different interventions and used several questionnaires to interview the young people about the effects of having participated in the studies brought to them. As a result it was very difficult to reach conclusions and for this reason we are highlighting the need for further studies.
In postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3-4, anti-osteoporotic drugs may reduce vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti-osteoporotic drugs probably make little or no difference to clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. In postmenopausal with CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti-osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death, and anti-osteoporotic drug may slightly improve BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti-osteoporotic drug improve BMD at the femoral neck. Among postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3-4, anti-osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, anti-osteoporotic drug may slightly improve bone strength. However, these conclusions are based on limited data and therefore uncertain.
All six completed studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted in 2929 male or female participants undergoing a surgical procedure and aged 60 years or over. An RCT is a study (or trial) which aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. The people taking part in the trial are randomly allocated to either the group receiving the treatment under investigation, or to a group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment) as the control. RCTs provide the most reliable evidence. Results from three studies (2529 participants) indicate that using the processed EEG to help deliver the optimal depth of anaesthesia could reduce the incidence of POD from 21.3% to 15.2%. Results from three studies (2051 participants) indicate that this could also reduce the incidence of POCD at three months from 9.1% to 6.4%. Our review provides moderate-quality evidence that anaesthesia guided by processed EEG indices could reduce the risk of postoperative delirium in patients aged 60 years or over undergoing non-cardiac and non-neurological surgical procedures. We found some moderate-quality evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction at three months could be reduced in these participants. There is insufficient evidence supporting the effect on POCD at one week and over one year after surgery or in younger patients.
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled studies up to 4 November 2019 and identified 41 eligible studies involving 3005 mothers and 3006 infants from at least 17 countries. The studies varied widely in babies ages, type of milk boosters investigated, how long they were taken, and how outcomes were reported. Medications included sulpiride, metoclopramide, domperidone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Natural interventions included banana flower, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, ixbut, levant cotton, moringa, palm dates, pork knuckle, shatavari, silymarin, torbangun leaves, and a variety of natural mixtures as teas or soups. Nine studies compared a milk-boosting medication with placebo or no treatment. None reported exclusive breastfeeding rates at 3. 4 or 6 months and only one (metoclopramide, 20 participants) reported on weight gain in infants receiving only their mothers' own milk, with better results in the milk booster group. Three studies that tracked milk volume (domperidone, metoclopramide, sulpiride; 151 participants) reported more milk in the booster groups, though the certainty of the evidence was low. Adverse effects were poorly reported. Where mentioned, they were limited to minor complaints, such as tiredness, nausea, decreased appetite, headache and dry mouth. Twenty-seven studies compared natural milk boosters with placebo or no treatment. Only one (Mother’s Milk Tea; 60 participants) examined the impact on breastfeeding rates, reporting "no significant difference at 6 months" without providing any data (very low-certainty evidence). Three studies (275 participants) reported infant weight, two of which (moringa, mixed botanical tea) reported higher gains in the milk booster group, while the other study (fennel and fenugreek) was inconclusive on whether infant weight gain improved with the milk boosters. In the 13 studies tracking changes in milk volume (Bu Xue Sheng Ru, Chan Bao, Cui Ru, banana flower, fenugreek, ginger, moringa, fenugreek, ginger and turmeric mix, ixbut, mixed botanical tea, Sheng Ru He Ji, silymarin, Xian Tong Ru, palm dates; 962 participants), some showed benefits and others little or no difference, so we are very uncertain about the results for milk volume. Adverse effects were poorly reported. Where mentioned, they were limited to minor complaints, such as mothers with urine that smells like maple syrup and rash in infants (very low-certainty evidence). Eight studies (Chanbao, Bue Xue Sheng Ru, domperidone, moringa, fenugreek, palm dates, torbangun, moloco, Mu Er Wu You, Kun Yuan Tong Ru) compared one milk booster with another. There was only one small study for each particular match-up, hence we cannot be certain if any one milk booster truly worked better than another. There is limited evidence that milk-boosting medications may increase milk volume and that natural milk boosters may improve milk volume and infants' weight, but we are very uncertain about the supporting evidence. Due to limited information, we are also uncertain if there are any risks to the mother or baby in taking any particular milk booster. More high-quality studies are needed to increase our certainty about the effects of milk boosters.
We wanted to know the benefits and harms of interventions designed to increase eating of fruit or vegetables or both amongst children aged five years and under. We searched various electronic databases to find studies. We contacted the authors of the included studies for additional potentially relevant studies. Any randomised study (where participants have the same chance of being assigned to treatment or a no-treatment control) of interventions aiming to increase the intake of fruit or vegetables or both by children aged five years and under, which measured intake, was eligible. Two review authors independently searched for and extracted information from studies. We searched up to March 2023. We included 53 studies with 12,350 people taking part. Sixteen studies examined child-feeding practice interventions (e.g. repeated exposure to vegetables); 20 examined multicomponent interventions (e.g. combining two or more interventions, such as preschool policy changes with parent nutrition education); 17 examined parent nutrition education interventions; two examined child nutrition education interventions; and one each examined child-focused mindfulness or providing families with fruit and vegetable interventions. Child-feeding practice interventions and multicomponent interventions probably lead to small increases in children's intake of fruit and vegetables in the short term (less than 12 months). Parent nutrition education interventions may lead to little to no increase in children's eating of fruit and vegetables. Limited information was available on cost and unintended harms. Of the studies that did report these, intervention costs ranged from 325 to 1500 US dollars (USD). No unintended harms were found in the two studies that reported assessing them. Studies reporting funding support received governmental or charitable funds, except for one study that received industry funding. No studies were conducted in low-income countries and only one study was conducted in a middle-income country. Our confidence in the current evidence is moderate for child feeding and multicomponent interventions, and low for parent nutrition education interventions. This evidence is up-to-date to March 2023. This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.
We found 63 randomised clinical trials where people with or suspected of a heart attack were randomly allocated to receiving beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention. The 63 trials included 85,550 adults with a mean age of 57.4 years. Only one trial was at low risk of bias. The remaining trials were at high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence according to GRADE ranged from very low to high. Fifty-six trials commenced beta-blockers versus control during the acute phase of acute myocardial infarction and seven trials during the subacute phase. We found 33 trials that were fully or partly funded by the industry, 20 trials that did not report their funding source, and 10 trials that were funded by other sources than the industry. Our present review shows that people receiving beta-blockers compared with people receiving placebo or no intervention seem at lower risk of a new heart attack in the acute phase after a heart attack. People receiving beta-blockers also seem at lower risk of dying from any cause and from any cardiac cause at long-term follow-up after a heart attack. Nevertheless, people receiving beta-blockers do not seem to have a lower or a higher risk of dying from any cause or from any cardiac cause in the acute phase after a heart attack. The effects of beta-blockers on all remaining outcomes (serious adverse events according to International Conference on Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice, major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of dying from a cardiac cause and a new non-fatal heart attack), new heart attack at long-term follow-up, quality of life, and angina) are uncertain due to none or sparse data.
Recent studies showed that a class of white blood cells (B lymphocytes) can be involved in the pathology of MS. This feature has led to a renewed interest in therapies directed at controlling B-cell activity. Rituximab belongs to the class of monoclonal antibodies and is able to diminish the number of B lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid. The authors of this review assessed the efficacy and safety of rituximab in patients with RRMS, taking into account relapses, brain lesions and disease progression. From the pertinent literature, only one study evaluating rituximab versus placebo in 104 adult patients with at least one relapse during the preceding year was included.
The authors did not find convincing evidence to support rituximab as an effective treatment for RRMS, also because the quality of the one identified study was limited due to high attrition bias, the small number of participants, and short follow-up. As far as safety is concerned, patients reported infusion-associated adverse events within the 24 hours after the first infusion, including chills, headache, nausea, pyrexia, pruritus, fatigue, throat irritation and pharyngolaryngeal pain. Among infection-associated adverse events, only urinary tract infections (in 14.5% versus 8.6%) and sinusitis (13.0% versus 8.6%) were more common in the rituximab group. The potential benefits of rituximab for treating RRMS need to be further evaluated in large-scale studies that are of high quality along with long-term safety.
We searched scientific databases from their beginning to February 2021 and found 25 randomised clinical trials. People had the same chance to be allocated to groups receiving beta-blockers or control. In 21 trials, the control was a placebo. In four trials, the control was no intervention. Trials included 22,423 adults with mean age of 56.9 years (range 50 to 63 years). Patients without heart failure after a heart attack receiving beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably have lower risk of death and of a new heart attack and may have reduced risk of major cardiovascular events and death of any heart-related cause, but likely not of angina pectoris. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events and on quality of life were uncertain due to lack of data. The evidence should be interpreted with caution, as certainty was judged to be moderate to low for all outcomes. Reasons mainly include high risk of bias for all included trials, limitations in design and execution, and risk of random error. This means that results might overestimate the beneficial effects of beta-blockers and underestimate the harmful effects. Therefore, the above mentioned results may change in the future, after additional well-designed randomised clinical trials are conducted.
We wanted to find out whether psychosocial interventions or medications can help pregnant women who report alcohol use in reducing or stopping such behaviour. We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) that compared psychosocial interventions or medications, or both, with no treatment, TAU, placebo (dummy treatment), or other treatments to help pregnant women stop or reduce their alcohol use. We included eight studies involving a total of 1369 pregnant women who reported alcohol use during pregnancy. In two studies, almost half of the participants were diagnosed with current or previous AUD. Most studies (75%) took place in the USA. Treatments were BIs, ranging from 10 to 60 minutes in duration, mainly delivered in a single session or few sessions (up to five). The group receiving BIs was compared with a group receiving TAU. Pregnant women received the psychosocial intervention at approximately 15 weeks of pregnancy, and alcohol use was assessed 8 to 24 weeks after the intervention. We did not find any study that looked at the effects of AUD medications during pregnancy.
We found that BIs may increase the rate of continuously abstinent women. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of BIs on the number of drinks per day. Finally, we found that BIs probably result in little to no difference in the number of women who completed treatment. We did not find any study that assessed the effectiveness and safety of AUD medications during pregnancy. Only two studies recruited pregnant women with current or lifetime AUD; this limitation means we cannot generalise our results to pregnant women who have AUD. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of psychosocial interventions or medication in helping pregnant women with AUD to stop or reduce alcohol use.
The effects of psychosocial interventions are largely influenced by the social context; given that most of the included studies took place in the USA, this limits the generalisability of the findings to countries and marginalised ethnic groups not recruited to these studies.
Globally, our results are far from being considered conclusive. The evidence is current to 8 January 2024.
We wanted to find out if dexmedetomidine is an effective and safe medicine to use for pain and stress relief in sick newborn babies who need mechanical ventilation. We searched for studies that looked at dexmedetomidine compared with opioids (such as morphine or fentanyl), non-opioid relaxing medicines (such as ketamine, midazolam, phenobarbital, or propofol), or placebo (dummy treatment) in sick newborns in need of mechanical ventilation. We did not find any studies comparing dexmedetomidine with relaxing medicines or placebo. We found four ongoing studies comparing dexmedetomidine with fentanyl, morphine, and ketamine plus dexmedetomidine. We are unsure if these studies will help answer the question about using dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in babies on mechanical ventilation, because we do not yet know if the babies in the studies will need mechanical ventilation. We did not find evidence to support using or not using dexmedetomidine to reduce pain and discomfort in preterm infants on mechanical ventilation. The evidence is current to September 2023.
There is no evidence from trials about the optimum depth for catheter insertion when suctioning clear the endotracheal tube in babies in neonatal intensive care. Babies in neonatal intensive care often need mechanical ventilation to assist breathing. This involves inserting an endotracheal tube (ETT) down the baby's windpipe so that a machine ventilator can help the baby breathe. Lung secretions can build up in the tube and cause blockages. Build-up is minimized by suctioning the ETT clear with a catheter (small tube). One of the variations of technique possible for suctioning is depth of catheter insertion into the ETT. However, the review found no trials to show what depth of insertion of catheter into the endotracheal tube gains optimal clearance without damaging the baby's lungs.
The antifibrinolytic drugs evaluated in this systematic review were aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid. We found nine studies that enrolled a total of 455 participants, aged 18 years or younger, who received either antifibrinolytic drugs or a placebo.
Total enrolment in each study ranged from 36 participants to 80 participants. Two of the studies evaluated aprotinin, four tranexamic acid and four aminocaproic acid. One study compared aminocaproic acid with tranexamic acid. The other studies administered placebo to the control group. Studies that evaluated aprotinin and aminocaproic acid used high doses (when reported). Of the studies that evaluated tranexamic acid, two used high doses, one used low doses and one did not describe the dose given. Five studies evaluated idiopathic scoliosis (scoliosis with no known cause), and four evaluated both idiopathic scoliosis and scoliosis that occurred as the result of another disease, such as cerebral palsy.
Of the nine included studies, five reported how long patients were assessed. Follow-up ranged from one to 10 days after surgery, or lasted for the participant's length of stay in the hospital. Two studies received grants from organizations of healthcare professionals, and one was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. The remaining studies did not report sources of funding. Antifibrinolytic drugs reduced the amount of blood lost during, or immediately after, surgery, by 427 millilitres (mL) (more than a 20% reduction in blood loss) and the amount of blood transfused during the same period by 327 mL. The number of children who received transfusions, either through blood from a donor or through a combination of blood from a donor and their own saved blood, was also significantly decreased. We assessed the quality of the evidence for all of these findings as low or very low because of the small numbers of participants, some concerns about study designs and imprecision in study findings.
No children included in any studies died, and very few adverse events were reported, although three children receiving placebo in one study developed a clot. However, these studies may not have adequately looked for adverse events, or study authors might not have reported them fully. Also, the number of children evaluated was too small and the time of follow-up too short to allow review authors to draw any conclusions about their safety. This systematic review showed that antifibrinolytic drugs reduce blood loss and decrease the number of children receiving blood transfusions and the amount of blood transfused, but the evidence supporting any of these findings is not very strong. The safety of antifibrinolytic drugs remains unclear.
The review includes 67 randomized controlled trials (5438 people). The trials included patients of all ages and both genders undergoing all types of surgery. The evidence was from studies available to October 2015. Forty-five trials compared a warming system to a control intervention, 18 compared different types of warming systems, and 10 compared different modalities of the same warming system. Forced-air warming was the most studied system. Active warming had some beneficial clinical effects on the patient. It reduced the risk of a major complication of heart and circulation in one trial in people with substantial disease of that system, but the evidence remains inconclusive. Active warming reduced the rate of infection and complications of surgical wounds.. This effect was shown in two quite large trials in people undergoing abdominal surgery; forced-air warming was applied exclusively before the operation in one study, while in the other it was applied during the operation. Patients receiving active warming systems had about one-third the risk of postsurgical chills or shivering compared to those receiving control treatment (29 trials, 1922 people). Thermal comfort was increased for the patient compared with the control intervention (10 trials involving 700 people). On the other hand, warming made little or no difference to the risk of death, blood loss or the need for a blood transfusion. We found no differences in the number of non-fatal heart attacks, in anxiety or in pain, compared with people in the control groups.
The trials in the review did not allow us to identify which warming system was better. However, there was an indication from one trial at low risk of bias that results were better when systemic warming was extended to the period before the operation in people undergoing major abdominal surgery. We could only get limited information from the study reports regarding adverse effects. In some cases the trials reported that there had been no adverse effects. The quality of the evidence was low for surgical site infections and complications of the heart and circulation. This is because very few trials with few events reported on these outcomes, although they were at low risk of bias. Patients differed in the types of surgery, with different complexities and duration, the type of anaesthesia, patient age, the severity of the condition and other illnesses. The trials did not last long, which made it difficult to detect clinical effects. These outcomes are also strongly influenced by other management components during the operation that we did not evaluate in this review. While some studies applied a single intervention, others used two or more interventions in combination, and/or included other methods of passive warming. The control group did not always consist of a 'pure control' without active heating, and sometimes patients also received another intervention as part of usual care. All these reasons may explain the diversity that we observed for some outcomes among the studies. The temperature of the control group may also have been more strictly controlled, as there is now widespread awareness of the risk of hypothermia.
We wanted to find out if antibiotics can be an effective prophylaxis for leptospirosis (that is, prevent leptospirosis) and if they have unwanted side effects? We searched medical databases for studies that assessed the use of antibiotics for the prophylaxis of leptospirosis. The studies could have compared antibiotics versus placebo (a pretend treatment) or no treatment, and antibiotics versus another antibiotic, or another dose or schedule of the same antibiotic. We found five studies with 2593 participants, which took place in Brazil, Sri Lanka, India, Panama, and Iran. Participants mostly resided in these areas. Three studies compared doxycycline versus either placebo or no treatment. One trial compared doxycycline versus azithromycin versus placebo. Only one trial compared penicillin versus placebo.
Antibiotics may not reduce the chance of developing leptospirosis infection and may lead to some non-serious side effects (for example, diarrhoea (loose stools), nausea (feeling sick), and vomiting (being sick)), particularly if doxycycline is used.
None of the studies reported serious side effects or assessed quality of life. We have low or very low confidence in the results. This was based on a few studies that had a wide range of results, problems in how the studies selected participants, a low number of participants, a high amount of missing information, and considerable differences between groups of participants. Four studies included statements disclosing their funding/supporting sources, and one study did not include this. Three of the four studies that disclosed their supporting sources received the supply of study medicine directly from the same pharmaceutical company, and the remaining trial received financial support from a governmental source. This review updates the previous Cochrane review. The evidence is up to date to 17 April 2023.
Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. These studies were added to the six that we found the last time we updated the review, bringing the total to 15 studies. Seven of these studies reported positive outcomes for healthcare processes or patient outcomes, or both, four studies reported mixed outcomes (positive and neutral) and four reported no effects of IPE. The studies differed in many respects. They were conducted in different areas of clinical practice and included different IPE interventions. The study designs and outcome measures were also different. All 15 studies compared outcomes following an IPE intervention to outcomes, either in similar clinical settings that did not receive the IPE intervention, or in the same clinical setting before the intervention was made. Because no studies compared an interprofessional intervention to a profession-specific intervention, our understanding of interprofessional interventions is limited. The small number of studies included in this review, and their varied nature, limit our understanding of the key components of IPE and its effectiveness. More studies are needed to allow sound conclusions to be reached about the effectiveness of IPE, as well as to inform IPE policy development. In particular, these should include: first, studies that assess the effectiveness of IPE interventions compared to separate, profession-specific interventions; second, RCT, CBA or ITS studies with qualitative strands examining processes relating to the IPE and practice changes; third, cost-benefit analyses.
Results from recent clinical trials showed that surgery reduced the risk of death. However, survivors were left with moderate to severe disability requiring help in their daily life activities. These results only apply to people 60 years of age or younger.
We identified only one randomised controlled trial (RCT), which compared plasma exchange with sham exchange, in 18 participants with either IgA or IgG paraproteinaemic neuropathy. The results were reported after three weeks of treatment. The trial did not report our primary outcome measure, which was improvement in disability measured by a validated scale six months after randomisation, or our other specified outcomes at six months. The trial demonstrated a modest benefit in improvement of weakness and overall disability as measured by the neuropathy disability score (NDS) over a period of three weeks. There was no improvement in this timescale in measures of sensory disturbance or electrical studies of the nerves. Adverse events were not reported. Further RCTs of this and other treatments with larger numbers of participants are needed.
This is an update of a review first published in 2007. We found no additional trials for inclusion. The evidence is current to January 2014.
This is an updated review that includes six new studies. We included 34 randomised controlled trials involving 5003 pregnant women (search date: November 2016). The women were healthy and at low risk of complications. They were given induction, a fake treatment (placebo) or no treatment. Limited information was available on the outcomes that were of interest, and risk of bias was generally low or unclear. The quality of evidence was judged to be low-quality, with a few moderate-quality findings.
Women at term who were induced as outpatients may be less likely to need further induction, compared to women given placebo or no treatment. Medications like vaginal PGE₂, mifepristone and oral misoprostol appear to be effective. No clear differences were reported for excessive activity of the uterus (hyperstimulation), caesarean section or need for neonatal intensive care.
There were too few women in these trials to determine differences in rare events, such as infant deaths or serious illnesses of mothers or babies. The trials did not report on use of emergency services to return to hospital. Some medications caused side effects (such as headaches). Overall, there was little information on costs of different methods. For healthy, low-risk pregnant women at term, outpatient induction and enabling women to return home to wait for labour to start appears to be feasible. Outpatient induction treatments may reduce both need for further drugs and time from treatment to birth. It does not appear to increase the likelihood of needing other interventions in labour. However, there is insufficient evidence to say definitively whether outpatient induction is safe. Future research should focus on which methods women prefer, and are most effective and safe.
The review of trials found that there is no evidence that low doses of danazol improve live births/ ongoing pregnancy rates. Other negative factors include adverse effects.
We included six randomised controlled trials comparing weekly versus daily FSH in 3753 women undertaking controlled ovarian stimulation as part of an IVF/ICSI cycle. Their age ranged from 18 to 41 years. The studies used different dosages of weekly FSH ranging from 60 to 240 μg. Five studies reported live birth rate and all six studies reported OHSS rate (our primary outcomes). The evidence is current to June 2015. There was no evidence of a difference in live birth rates between medium dose (150 to 180 μg) weekly FSH and daily FSH. There was evidence of a reduced live birth rate in women who received lower doses (60 to 120 μg) of weekly FSH when compared to daily FSH. Only one study used a high dose of weekly FSH, so we cannot make conclusions about this dosage group.There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in OHSS rate. We concluded that medium dose (150 to 180 μg) weekly FSH is a safe treatment option and is as effective in terms of life birth rate as daily FSH injections. The quality of the evidence was graded as moderate. Five out of six studies were funded by the same drug manufacturer.
We wanted to determine the benefits and harms of routine stenting (adding a temporary plastic tube to this join) in kidney transplant recipients to prevent major urological complications. We searched for all trials that assessed the benefits and harms of randomly allocating transplant recipients to receive a stent during surgery or not. We compared and summarised the trials' results and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as trial methods and size. We included 12 studies involving 1960 transplant recipients. The number of major urological complications was reduced by using a stent. Stent insertion also reduces the risk of major urological complications even when the stent is only left in place for a short period of time after transplant (≤ 14 days).
The impact of stenting on urinary tract infections was uncertain. However, when the stent was only left in place for a short period, or people were on preventative antibiotics, stenting did not cause more UTIs. The presence of a stent did not appear to increase blood in the urine. More studies are needed to investigate the use of selective versus universal prophylactic stenting for the unresolved issues of quality of life and cost. We are reasonably confident that inserting a stent during kidney transplantation reduces the number of major urological complications. We are less certain of the results for the number of urinary tract infections, the effect on patient and kidney survival, increased blood in the urine, quality of life, and the overall cost. The evidence is current to June 2024.
This review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of intranasal corticosteroids for improving nasal airway obstruction in children aged 0 to 12 years with moderate to severe adenoidal hypertrophy. Evidence derived from five of the six randomised controlled trials included in this review suggests that intranasal steroids may significantly improve symptoms of nasal obstruction in children with adenoidal hypertrophy and that this improvement may be associated with the reduction of adenoid size. One study did not find a significant improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms. Further large and high-quality randomised controlled trials are warranted.
Six trials were analysed in this updated review, involving a total of 1270 participants. Three trials compared routine shunting with no shunting, one trial compared routine shunting versus selective shunting, and another two trials compared different methods of monitoring in selective shunting. We have not yet identified any trials that compared selective shunting with no shunting. All the included trials assessed shunting used in people undergoing endarterectomy under general anaesthetic. Overall, the participant ages ranged from 40 to 89 years and there were more male than female participants. Where reported, participants were followed up for no longer than 30 days. A very limited number of trials suggested that routine shunting compared to no shunting in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under general anaesthesia resulted in a lower stroke-related death within 30 days of surgery, less stroke rate within 24 hours of surgery and ipsilateral rate reduction within 30 days of surgery. More trials are needed. Low quality of the evidence for all outcomes reduced the reliability of the results. There were significant problems contributing to the low quality, especially in the research methodology.
On 12 November 2015 we searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials and found a single trial conducted across four rural districts in Ghana. The trial randomised 28 community health officers (serving 2404 potentially eligible pregnant women) to the intervention group and 26 community health officers (3515 potentially eligible pregnant women) to the control group.
It was uncertain from this trial whether the intervention prevented loss of more than one litre of blood (severe PPH) as the results were variable and suggested anything between a 98% decrease to a 30% increase in blood loss (very low-quality evidence ). Because there were no cases of severe maternal illness (for example, because of uterine rupture), or maternal deaths, it was not possible to fully assess the effect of the intervention on those outcomes (thequality of the evidence was very low).
The women receiving oxytocin had half the incidence of PPH (> 500 mL) compared with the control group (low-quality evidence ). There was little or no difference between the oxytocin and control groups on the rates for transfer or referral of women to a healthcare facility (low-quality evidence ), stillbirths (low-quality evidence ), or the numbers of babies that died within three days of being born (low-quality evidence).
There were no cases of oxytocin use during labour, needle-stick injury or any other major or minor adverse events or unanticipated harmful event.
Overall, the quality of the evidence was low/very low because of methodological limitations in the trial and imprecision in the effect estimates for all the important outcomes. It is uncertain if the administration of oxytocin by community health officers without midwifery skills administered in non-health facility settings compared with a control group reduces the incidence of severe PPH, severe maternal illness or maternal deaths when compared with a control group. However, oxytocin probably decreases the incidence of PPH (> 500 mL).
Considering the very specific setting where the trial was conducted and the limited role played by the community health officer in the trial, the applicability of the evidence is rather limited.
Further high-quality randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to assess the effects of using oxytocin in pre-filled injection devices or other new delivery systems on severe PPH. Similarly, future studies should consider other important outcomes like possible adverse events and the acceptability of the intervention for mothers and other community stakeholders.
We wanted to know if shared decision-making could help women feel more satisfied, confident, and knowledgeable when deciding whether to participate in breast cancer screening. We included studies that looked at how shared decision-making affects women making choices about breast cancer screening. We chose studies that compared some or all the important aspects of shared decision-making with routine care. We judged how certain we could be in the findings based on factors like study methods and sizes. We looked at 19 studies with 64,215 women. Women were given information about the pros and cons of breast cancer screening. Most studies used tools to provide this information. Six studies did not include a discussion with a healthcare professional, and 11 studies did not consider a woman’s values and preferences. The studies followed women for a short time, usually from one to three months, and were conducted in the USA, Europe, Australia, and one in Iran. Most studies were funded by government or schools, and some by private groups.
Shared decision-making involving all key components
Two studies included discussions with healthcare professionals and considered values and preferences. Based on a single study, shared-decision making may not affect women’s knowledge about when to start screening and screening frequency, but the results are uncertain. The two studies did not look at outcomes like women’s satisfaction with the shared decision-making process, confidence in screening choices, adherence to decisions, active participation in decision-making, effective communication with doctors, or changes in mental health.
Shortened forms of shared decision-making with clarification of values and preferences
Six studies used decision-making tools and considered values and preferences but did not include conversations with a healthcare professional. This type of shared decision-making could make women feel more confident and knowledgeable about their choices, although it may not affect anxiety or cancer worry. These studies did not look at outcomes like women’s satisfaction with the shared decision-making process, adherence to decisions, active participation in decision-making, or effective communication with doctors.
Enhanced communication about risks without other components of shared decision-making
Eleven studies provided women with information about options and the pros and cons but did not include a conversation with a healthcare professional or consider women’s values and preferences. This type of shared decision-making helps women feel more knowledgeable about their choices, although it is unclear if it increases confidence. It does not affect anxiety or depression, but does reduce cancer worry. These studies did not look at outcomes like women’s satisfaction with the shared decision-making process, adherence to decisions, active participation in decision-making, or effective communication with doctors. Although there were many studies involving a total of over 60,000 women, the studies used different approaches to look at shared decision-making, presented data in varied formats, and did not look at outcomes considered important in our review. These differences prevented us from combining information in some cases for clear results. Also, some studies had issues with their methods. As a result, we cannot be certain about some of the conclusions in this review. The information is current to August 2023.
This review sought evidence that feeding these infants with nutrient-enriched formula milk rather than breast milk would increase growth rates and benefit development. No trials of this intervention were found. Whether undertaking such trials would be acceptable to mothers of preterm infants is not known.
We included 120 studies (which comprised 29,592 people randomised in 116 trials; in four trials the number of randomised participants was unclear). Through our search, we found studies assessing different concentrations of BPO, BPO delivered through various means, or BPO used alone or given with other treatments that may or may not be considered as the primary treatment. These studies compared treatments against different concentrations or formulations of BPO, placebo, no treatment, or other medical treatments given alone or in combination.
Most of the studies included male and female participants with mild to moderate acne; only 67% of studies reported participant age, which ranged between 18 and 30 years. Participants were treated for over eight weeks in nearly two-thirds of the trials. Industry financially supported approximately two-fifths of the trials, and more than half of the trials did not report their funding sources. Few studies reported where they were set, but locations included hospitals, medical centres, national medical institutes, clinics, medical departments, and general practices. We found low-certainty evidence to suggest that long-term (i.e. given for longer than eight weeks) BPO treatment may increase self-reported treatment success compared to placebo or no BPO treatment (three studies), but there may be little to no difference when BPO treatment is compared to adapalene (five studies) or clindamycin (one study). This outcome was not reported by studies comparing BPO treatment to erythromycin or salicylic acid.
Long-term BPO may lead to an increased chance of treatment discontinuation compared to placebo or no treatment (24 studies), with the most common causes being redness, itch, and skin burning (low-certainty evidence). When medium- to long-term BPO was compared to adapalene (11 studies), clindamycin (eight studies), erythromycin (one study), or salicylic acid (one study), we found only very low-certainty evidence, meaning that although there may be little to no difference in withdrawal between these groups, we are not sure of the results. It should be noted that participant withdrawal may be linked to issues around treatment acceptability (dermatitis, rash, facial swelling, sensitivity) rather than to safety.
Very low-certainty evidence means that we are uncertain if BPO leads to more side effects among participants receiving medium- to long-term BPO than among those given no treatment/placebo (21 studies), adapalene (seven studies), erythromycin (one study), or salicylic acid (one study). Medium-term treatment with BPO may lead to increased risk of side effects when compared against clindamycin, but the effects of this treatment vary, so the treatment chosen may make little to no difference (six studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Side effects reported in these studies were usually mild to moderate, and the most common were local dryness, irritation, eczema, redness, pain at the site of application, and pruritus. For our key comparisons, we rated the certainty of evidence for 'participant-reported acne improvement' as low. For the outcomes 'withdrawal due to adverse effects' and ‘percentage of participants having any adverse events', the evidence was mainly of very low certainty.
Included trials were at high or unclear risk of bias, participant numbers were small, results were not consistent across trials, and we suspected publication bias.
This review, which is an update of one published in 2002, includes nine studies that involved 946 teenagers, almost all males. The studies were conducted in different parts of the USA and involved young people of different races whose average age ranged from 15 to 17 years. Results indicate that not only do these programs fail to deter crime, but they actually lead to more offending behavior. The intervention increases the odds of offending by between 1.6 to 1 and 1.7 to 1. Government officials permitting this program need to adopt rigorous evaluation efforts to ensure that they are not causing more harm to the very citizens they pledge to protect.
We searched the literature to July 2016. We included 22 trials (total of 1650 participants). Twenty of the studies evaluated topical treatment, and two studies evaluated treatment taken by mouth (oral). Comparisons included physical therapies, as well as topical and oral treatments. Most studies were set in hospital outpatient or emergency departments, and were performed in North America, the UK, Asia, or South America. Participants were of both sexes and were mainly children or young adults. Follow-up duration varied from 3 to 28 weeks after randomisation. Only five studies had longer than 3 months' follow-up.
Five studies reported commercial funding, three studies obtained medication for free from pharmaceutical companies, 12 studies did not mention the source of funding, one study reported charity funding, and one study reported they had had no financial support. We found that many common treatments for molluscum, such as physical destruction, have not been adequately evaluated. Some of the included treatments are not part of standard practice.
We found moderate-quality evidence that topical 5% imiquimod is probably no more effective than vehicle (i.e. the same cream but without imiquimod) in achieving short-, medium-, and long-term clinical cure. High-quality (and thus more certain) evidence showed that topical 5% imiquimod is no better than placebo at improving molluscum up to three months after the start of treatment.
High-quality evidence showed that 5% imiquimod differed little or not at all in the number of side effects compared to vehicle. However, moderate-quality evidence suggests that there are probably more application site reactions when using topical 5% imiquimod compared with vehicle.
Low-quality evidence, based on one or two mostly small studies, revealed the following results for the outcome short-term clinical cure: 5% imiquimod less effective than cryospray or 10% potassium hydroxide; 10% Australian lemon myrtle oil more effective than olive oil; 10% benzoyl peroxide cream more effective than 0.05% tretinoin; 5% sodium nitrite co-applied with 5% salicylic acid more effective than 5% salicylic acid alone; and iodine plus tea tree oil more effective than tea tree oil or iodine alone. We found more uncertain (low-quality) evidence to suggest that 10% potassium hydroxide is more effective than saline; homeopathic calcarea carbonica is more effective than placebo; 2.5% solution of potassium hydroxide is less effective than 5% solution of potassium hydroxide; and 10% povidone iodine solution and 50% salicylic acid plaster are more effective than salicylic acid plaster alone.
Except for the severe application site reactions of imiquimod, none of these treatments led to serious adverse effects (low-quality evidence). Pain during treatment application, redness, and itching were among the most reported adverse effects.
We found no differences between the treatments assessed in the other comparisons.
We found no randomised trials for several commonly used treatments, such as expressing lesions with an orange stick or topical hydrogen peroxide. Since most lesions resolve within months, unless better evidence for the superiority of active treatments emerges, molluscum contagiosum can be left to heal naturally. For topical imiquimod, the quality of the evidence for clinical cure, short-term improvement, and adverse effects was moderate to high. For all other comparisons, the quality of the evidence for short-term clinical cure and adverse effects was low. Common limitations of the included studies were that the numbers of participants were small, the investigators were not blinded, and participants who did not complete the study (numerous in some studies) were not included in the analyses.
Our team of researchers searched the medical literature for:
• randomized controlled trials: these are medical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups. This type of study provides the most reliable evidence about whether a treatment makes a difference;
• studies on people of all ages with traumatic iridocyclitis;
• studies that compared the effects of mydriatics plus corticosteroids against corticosteroids alone. We found no randomized controlled trials to help us answer our question. Therefore, we do not know whether the addition of mydriatics to corticosteroids is beneficial or causes more unwanted effects than corticosteroids alone in the treatment of traumatic iridocyclitis. We need researchers to conduct future studies that compare mydriatics plus corticosteroids against corticosteroids, so that we can assess the benefits and risks of mydriatics as an additional treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis. We last searched for evidence on 12 June 2019. This review covered research that was available up to that date, but did not consider any evidence that may have been produced since then.
The use of stents following pancreaticoduodenectomy was studied in 1018 participants from eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We found no evidence that the use of stents leads to lower risk of fistula when compared with no stents. We also found no evidence of a difference between the use of internal and external stents. There was not enough evidence to determine the effects of replacement of pancreatic juice versus no replacement of pancreatic juice. Further RCTs on the use of stents after pancreaticoduodenectomy are needed. All eight included studies were reported as RCTs. The quality of the findings ranged from moderate to low across the different outcomes. The main limiting factor, which was the reason for a decrease in quality in some outcomes, was only one study included in internal stents versus no stents group. It is important to acknowledge the large potential impact if the average effect of one study differs in size or direction.
The 11 studies (involving 643 adults and adolescents) were conducted in Europe (3 studies), the USA (4), Hong Kong (2), Mexico (1) and Australia (1). People in the studies were followed and assessed from 12 weeks to 2 years.
The 11 studies measured different aspects of quality of life. People received skills-based psychological therapies reported better quality of life overall than those who received usual care (8 studies), social support (2) or antidepressant medicines (1).
Ten of these 11 studies also looked at subscales of the quality of life questionnaires to assess specific aspects of quality of life. People in these studies reported better results on the six subscales, - emotional well-being, energy and fatigue, overall well-being, seizure worries, medication effects, and social function, which are combined to calculated overall quality of life. We concluded that skills-based psychological therapies may improve well-being (quality of life) in adults and adolescents with epilepsy.
We are moderately confident in our result from these 11 studies of psychological therapies in people with epilepsy. We believe that more studies on this specific outcome of quality of life would be unlikely to change our findings.
This review is current up to 12 August 2019.
.
The review includes 10 small, short studies published mainly in the 1980s involving a total of 261 people. .
One small study found that after 2 weeks' treatment both alpha-methyldopa and reserpine may lead to clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms compared with placebo, but the quality of evidence was low. We are uncertain about the effect of reserpine versus alpha-methyldopa; quality of evidence was very low. Another small trial compared tetrabenazine and haloperidol after 18 weeks' treatment, but again we are uncertain about the effect as the quality of evidence was very low. The included studies did not report on any harmful effects of the drugs. .
Evidence is weak, limited, short term, and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia and their use is entirely experimental. There is a need for larger and more rigorous research in the area.
This plain language summary was adapted by the review authors from a summary originally written by Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation (mcpin.org/).
We identified four studies that evaluated interventions designed to improve adherence to ART among children and adolescents age 18 years and younger. These studies showed that home-based nursing, peer support for adolescents and LPV/r-containing regimens have the potential to improve ART adherence, but more evidence is needed. Medication diaries do not appear to have an effect on adherence. There is a need for well-designed evaluations of interventions to improve paediatric adherence to ART.
This systematic review of six trials, involving 1274 participants, found there was not enough data to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of naftidrofuryl relating to survival or disability in the treatment of acute stroke.
We prepared this edition of this review by updating the methods and searching for evidence from the medical literature on 14 September 2016. The review now includes 11 randomised controlled trials (with 5977 women) that compared episiotomy as needed (selective episiotomy) with routine episiotomy in terms of benefits and harms for mother and baby in women at low risk of instrumental delivery.
The trials were from ten different countries. In women where health staff were only conducting selective episiotomy, there may be 30% fewer with severe perineal trauma at birth compared with women where a policy of routine episiotomy was applied (eight trials, 5375 women, low-certainty evidence). We do not know if there is a difference in average blood loss between the groups (two trials, very low-certainty evidence). There is probably no difference in Apgar less than seven at five minutes, with no events in either groups (moderate-certainty evidence). We do not know if there is a difference in the number of women with moderate or severe perineal pain three days after giving birth (one trial, 165 women, very low-certainty evidence) but careful assessment of women's pain was not well carried out in the included trials. There may be little or no difference in the number of women developing perineal infection (two trials, low-certainty evidence); and there is probably little or no difference in women reporting painful sexual intercourse six months or more after delivery (three trials, 1107 women, moderate-certainty evidence); for urinary incontinence six months or more after delivery, there may be little or no difference between the groups. One study reported genital prolapse three years after the birth and there was no clear difference between groups (low-certainty evidence). Other important outcomes relating to long-term effects were not reported in these trials (urinary fistula, rectal fistula, and faecal incontinence).
One trial examined selective episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy in women for whom an operative vaginal birth was intended. The results showed no clear difference in severe perineal trauma between the restrictive and routine use of episiotomy.
Women's views on the different policies were not reported. Overall, the findings show that selective use of episiotomy in women (where a normal delivery without forceps is anticipated) means that fewer women have severe perineal trauma. Thus the rationale for conducting routine episiotomies to prevent severe perineal trauma is not justified by current evidence, and we could not identify any benefits of routine episiotomy for the baby or the mother.
More research is needed in order to inform policy in women where an instrumental birth is planned and episiotomy is often advocated. Outcomes could be better standardised and measured.
We searched for evidence on 18 September 2017, and found 27 trials. We found evidence from 13 studies (involving 15,730 women) that calcium supplementation in high doses (at least 1 gram (g) daily) during pregnancy may be a safe way of reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia, especially in women from communities with low dietary calcium and those at increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Women receiving calcium supplements may also be less likely to die or have serious problems related to pre-eclampsia (low-quality evidence) and high blood pressure. Babies may be less likely to be born preterm (low-quality evidence). The syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets was increased with calcium, but the absolute numbers were small (high-quality evidence). High-dose calcium did not have a clear effect on babies admitted to neonatal intensive care, or the number of stillbirths or deaths before discharge from hospital.
Further research is needed into the ideal dosage of supplementation. Limited evidence from 12 trials (2334 women) suggested that a relatively low dose of calcium may be effective in reducing pre-eclampsia, high blood pressure, and babies admitted to intensive care (however, the quality of the evidence on calcium alone was reduced because eight of the included trials gave other medicines alongside calcium, such as vitamin D, linoleic acid or antioxidants). Low-dose calcium did not have a clear effect on preterm birth, stillbirth or death before discharge from hospital.
One small study compared high-dose calcium with low-dose calcium. Pre-eclampsia appeared to be reduced in the high-dose group, but no other differences were found in preterm birth, or stillbirth. In settings where dietary calcium is low, supplementation is an important strategy to reduce the serious consequences of pre-eclampsia. Where high-dose supplementation is not feasible, the option of lower dose supplements (500 milligrams (mg) to 600 mg daily) might be considered in preference to no supplementation.
Our synthesis included 11 studies, involving around 267 participants; five more studies are awaiting classification. We identified several potential barriers and facilitators to the use of protocols. First, doctors used protocols only in certain circumstances; otherwise they preferred to wean using their own knowledge and skills. Relatively inexperienced nurses often lacked confidence. A protocol could encourage their involvement in weaning because it set out clear instructions and also helped them to feel more secure. Although more experienced nurses also recognized these positive qualities, they criticized protocols as sometimes instructing them to wean contrary to their own clinical judgement. Second, the practical arrangements for care within an ICU could either help or hinder healthcare professionals to work together, and in this way influence how (well) a protocol was used. Third, the use of a protocol reflected how healthcare professionals interact with one another generally. For example, the degree of experience a nurse or doctor possessed could influence the confidence others had that they could wean safely. For this reason, doctors tended to be reluctant to involve nurses they considered to be relatively inexperienced in weaning, even when there was a protocol in place. Furthermore, the fact that doctors occupied a higher professional status or position meant that it was difficult for nurses to be involved in weaning, including by using a protocol, unless the doctors s/he worked with permitted this to happen. We developed 35 summary statements. Of these: we assessed 17 statements as ‘low’ confidence, largely because the evidence used to develop them came from only a small number of studies. We rated 13 statements as ‘moderate’ confidence, largely because the evidence used to develop them came from very well-conducted studies, and we rated five statements as ‘high’ confidence, largely because the evidence used to develop them came from a majority of the studies.
We identified 14 trials, which included 2488 participants with mild, moderate, or severe one-sided Bell's palsy of unknown cause. Participants were aged from 14 to 84 years. The trials compared:
- antivirals plus corticosteroids to corticosteroids alone or in combination with placebo;
- antivirals alone or in combination with placebo to placebo or no treatment;
- antivirals alone or in combination with placebo to corticosteroid treatment alone or in combination with placebo; or
- antivirals plus corticosteroids to placebo or no treatment.
For the majority of the studies, no information on funding was given. The remaining were mostly partly public funded, and one trial was funded by a pharmaceutical company.
Eleven studies had high or uncertain risk of bias from various factors that can systematically affect trial results. We chose to base our conclusions only on data from three studies at a lower risk of bias. The review showed that there may be no clear difference in rates of incomplete recovery from Bell's palsy after treatment with the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids, compared to corticosteroids alone. This finding was of low certainty and was based on data from three trials involving 766 people with Bell's palsy of various degrees of severity. We excluded data from 10 trials with multiple potential sources of bias. However, we can be moderately confident that the combined therapy reduced the number of people left with long-term effects of Bell's palsy (excessive tearing of the eyes or an abnormal facial movement) compared to corticosteroid treatment alone.
Data from two studies (98 participants) showed that in people with severe Bell's palsy (complete or almost complete facial paralysis), combined antivirals and corticosteroids had no clear effect on recovery compared with corticosteroid treatment alone.
Corticosteroids alone were more effective than antivirals alone on rates of incomplete recovery (667 participants, 2 trials); antivirals and corticosteroids combined were more effective than placebo or no treatment (658 participants, 2 trials); and there was no clear benefit from antivirals alone over placebo (658 participants, 2 trials).
Although, based on data from two trials (656 participants), we found no clear difference in the occurrence of side effects between people receiving both antivirals and corticosteroids, compared to those receiving corticosteroids alone, this evidence is too uncertain for us to draw conclusions.
Large studies in people with Bell's palsy comparing additional antiviral agents may be indicated in the future.
We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of acupuncture in babies with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Our primary outcomes were death, long-term brain development in children aged 18 to 24 months and aged 3 to 5 years, unwanted events, and length of hospital stay. We searched for studies that compared acupuncture to no treatment, placebo or sham treatment (fake or pretend treatment given to participants in a scientific study), any medicines, or other types of acupuncture (e.g. acupuncture with needles compared to laser acupuncture). We found four studies that included 464 babies with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The studies ranged in size from 60 to 200 babies. Three studies were conducted in China and one in Russia. None of the four studies reported any of the outcomes of interest in our review. We are unable to draw any conclusions about the benefits and harms of acupuncture for babies with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to lack of evidence. We did not identify any ongoing studies. The studies did not report any information that we could use in our review. This review updates the previous version published in 2013. The evidence is current to March 2023.
The conclusion is based on limited data from two small studies. The larger of the studies, conducted in 73 patients with Alzheimer's disease, showed no beneficial effect of trazodone at all. A smaller cross-over study in patients with frontal lobe dementia showed a trend for reduction in some symptoms in the first study period. Larger, longer studies are needed to explore the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of trazodone.
We found 90 studies, which included 29,044 adults who smoked. The studies compared nicotine e-cigarettes with:
· nicotine replacement therapy, such as patches or gum;
· varenicline (a medicine to help people stop smoking);
· e-cigarettes without nicotine;
· heated tobacco (products designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release vapour, without burning it or producing smoke; these differ from e-cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid);
· other types of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes (e.g. pod devices, newer devices);
· behavioural support, such as advice or counselling; or
· no support for stopping smoking.
Most studies took place in the USA (39 studies), the UK (20), and Italy (9). People are more likely to stop smoking for at least six months using nicotine e-cigarettes than using nicotine replacement therapy (7 studies, 2544 people), or e-cigarettes without nicotine (6 studies, 1613 people).
Nicotine e-cigarettes may help more people to stop smoking than no support or behavioural support only (11 studies, 6819 people).
For every 100 people using nicotine e-cigarettes to stop smoking, 8 to 10 might successfully stop, compared with only 6 of 100 people using nicotine-replacement therapy, 7 of 100 using e-cigarettes without nicotine, or 4 of 100 people having no support or behavioural support only.
We are uncertain if there is a difference between how many unwanted effects occur using nicotine e-cigarettes compared with nicotine replacement therapy, no support or behavioural support only. There was some evidence that non-serious unwanted effects were more common in groups receiving nicotine e-cigarettes compared to no support or behavioural support only. Low numbers of unwanted effects, including serious unwanted effects, were reported in studies comparing nicotine e-cigarettes to nicotine replacement therapy. There is probably no difference in how many non-serious unwanted effects occur in people using nicotine e-cigarettes compared to e-cigarettes without nicotine.
The unwanted effects reported most often with nicotine e-cigarettes were throat or mouth irritation, headache, cough, and feeling sick. These appeared similar to those people experience when using NRT. These effects were reduced over time as people continued using nicotine e-cigarettes. Our results are based on few studies for most outcomes and, for some outcomes, the data varied widely.
We found evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes help more people to stop smoking than nicotine replacement therapy. Nicotine e-cigarettes probably help more people to stop smoking than e-cigarettes without nicotine, but more studies are still needed to confirm this.
Studies comparing nicotine e-cigarettes with behavioural or no support also showed higher quit rates in people using nicotine e-cigarettes, but provide less certain data because of issues with study design.
Most of our results for the unwanted effects could change when more evidence becomes available. Nicotine e-cigarettes can help people to stop smoking for at least six months. Evidence shows they work better than nicotine replacement therapy, and probably better than e-cigarettes without nicotine.
They may work better than no support, or behavioural support alone, and they may not be associated with serious unwanted effects.
However, we still need more evidence, particularly about the effects of newer types of e-cigarettes that have better nicotine delivery than older types of e-cigarettes, as better nicotine delivery might help more people quit smoking.
The quality of evidence is generally low to very low. Most studies did not evaluate dietary interventions for key review outcomes, particularly mortality and morbidity. However, a few study outcomes with moderate-certainty evidence focused on dietary intake and physical measurements. Included studies compared dietary interventions versus control or usual care. We pooled data from similar randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide a summary estimate of the effects of an intervention, and we judged how confident (certain) we were of these findings by using an established method (GRADE). We identified 25 RCTs involving 27 different comparisons. For some outcomes, we found absence of evidence for dietary interventions. We found some evidence showing that dietary interventions probably did not modify energy intake; however, some evidence shows what is probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake (moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence on dietary fibre was mixed for different advice on weight reducing or healthy eating. Dietary interventions compared to control probably improved the Diet Quality Index (moderate-certainty evidence). For physical measurements, we found a probable reduction in body mass index (BMI) with dietary interventions compared to controls (moderate-certainty evidence) but little evidence showing any change in waist-to-hip ratio (low-certainty evidence). For quality of life (QoL), results were mixed due to the wide variety of tools used. No adverse events were reported. Available evidence shows that dietary interventions can be helpful in modifying fruit and vegetable servings and diet quality; modification of fibre intake was variable, and some benefits were seen for anthropometric measurements, including BMI. Most of the evidence is based on women with breast cancer, so more research is needed for patients with other cancers. Gaps identified in the evidence involved the use of new technologies, comorbidities, and body composition data.
The review found 260 studies which had recruited over 43 thousand people undergoing abdominal surgery. The studies had some limitations in relation to the number of people who remained in the studies and the possibility that the results were affected because some of the researchers in the studies knew which people had received antibiotics before surgery. However, when the results were analysed effect of prophylactic antibiotics was consistently beneficial meaning that these limitations were unlikely to have had a major impact on the nature of the overall results. Abdominal surgical wound infection in patients having operations on the large intestine occurs in about 40% of patients if antibiotics are not given. This risk can be greatly diminished by the administration of antibiotics prophylactically before surgery. The antibiotic(s) given usuallly needs to cover different types of bacteria some of which need oxygen (aerobic bacteria) and others which do not need oxygen (anaerobic bacteria).. They are usually given via a canula injected into a vein, though there is evidence that a combination of oral and intravenous antibiotics may provide more protection. This last finding raises a problem in that current clinical practice is to avoid mechanical cleansing of the colon because it is not thought to be necessary before surgery (and not popular with patients). Studies that found a benefit to oral antibiotics were done at a time when mechanical cleansing of the colon was routinely done. In the light of current practice regarding mechanical cleansing before surgery of the colon, the benefit of oral antibiotics is uncertain.
We included 51 studies randomising 30,994 adult patients. Patients in the studies were given a HIF stabiliser, a sugar pill (placebo), or erythropoietin treatment. The treatment they got was decided by random chance. The studies were generally short-term (over a few weeks). There were no studies in children or people who had received a kidney transplant.
HIF stabilisers decreased blood transfusions for people with CKD when compared to placebo or erythropoietin treatment. HIF stabilisers increased the number of patients reaching their haemoglobin target level when compared to placebo. HIF stabilisers have uncertain effects on life expectancy and the chance of heart disease in people with CKD. HIF stabilisers decreased the need for a blood transfusion for people with CKD and increased the number of patients reaching their haemoglobin target level. We are not sure whether hypoxia-inducible factor stabilisers have any impact on life expectancy or life quality in people with CKD when compared to a placebo or other treatments for anaemia.
We included five studies recruiting 21,379 children, published between 2001 and 2021, that assessed the accuracy of seven CDRs (NEXUS, Canadian C-Spine Rule, PECARN retrospective criteria, NICE guidelines CG56 and CG176, Leonard de novo model and PEDSPINE) to evaluate CSIs following blunt trauma in children. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine which CDRs are most effective at detecting CSIs following blunt trauma in children, particularly for those younger than eight years of age. Although most CDRs accurately identified children who had a CSI (called high sensitivity), they frequently did not correctly identify children who did not have a CSI (called low specificity). If these CDRs were applied as a rule, a large proportion of children without CSI attending the emergency department for a blunt trauma assessment would receive imaging potentially exposing them to unnecessary radiation. These CDRs are at best a guide to clinical assessment with current evidence not supporting strict use of CDRs in trauma care for children. More research is needed to evaluate the accuracy of CDRs for use in cervical spine assessment in children. The quality of the studies was variable as there were differences in the children recruited, the number of CSIs, and the methods used making us uncertain about the results. There are currently two large ongoing studies that should contribute to the evidence of the accuracy of CDRs in children. The evidence is up to date to 13 December 2022.
This review included 13 trials with 5810 participants from Latin America, Africa and Asia. All trials compared the provision of MNP for point-of-use fortification with no intervention or placebo. Six trials included participants younger than 59 months of age only, four included only children aged 60 months of age or older, and three trials included children both younger and older than 59 months of age. MNPs contained from two to 18 vitamins and minerals. We searched existing clinical trials in December 2016 and ongoing trials in April 2017. We also contacted relevant institutions for additional information upon publication of the protocol and in April 2017. The review found that children receiving iron-containing MNP for point-of-use fortification of foods were at significantly lower risk of having anaemia and iron deficiency and had higher haemoglobin concentrations. We did not find any positive or negative effect on diarrhoea or mortality, but the data on these two outcomes were very limited. We rated the overall quality of the evidence for the provision of multiple MNP versus no intervention or placebo as moderate for anaemia, iron deficiency and adverse effects. We judged the evidence to be of low quality for haemoglobin, mortality and diarrhoea, and to be very low-quality for ferritin. In general, the most common risk of bias in the studies was the lack of blinding for participants, personnel and outcome assessors. Point-of-use fortification of foods with MNPs containing iron reduces anaemia and iron deficiency in preschool- and school-age children and seems feasible for public health purposes. However, future research should aim to increase the body of evidence on mortality, morbidity, developmental outcomes and adverse effects. Due to the lack of trials, we were unable to determine at this time if this intervention has comparable effects to those observed with iron supplements (provided as drops, tablets or syrup).
For people with focal onset seizures, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be moderate to high. The design of the trials (whether the people and treating clinicians knew which drug they were taking) may have influenced how long a participant stayed on their treatment. For the small number of people with generalised onset or unclassified seizures, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to moderate. The evidence is current to May 2018. Carbamazepine is currently recommended by experts for the treatment of individuals who are newly diagnosed with focal onset seizures and the results of this review do not provide any evidence to contradict this. More information is needed for people with generalised onset or unclassified seizures. All future trials comparing these drugs, or any other antiepileptic drugs, should be designed using high-quality methods, and the types of seizure of the people included in any trials should be classified very carefully to ensure that the results are of high quality.
This review of 35 randomised controlled trials found that laparoscopic surgery is feasible and less expensive than open surgery in the treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy. In selected patients, non-surgical treatment options can be used. Medical treatment with systemic methotrexate is an option for women with tubal ectopic pregnancy with no signs of bleeding whose pregnancy hormone blood levels are relatively low. An evaluation of expectant management of tubal ectopic pregnancy cannot be adequately made yet.
Researchers from Cochrane searched for all available literature up to 30 March 2015. We did not identify any eligible studies looking at the best strategy to wean or withdraw HHFNC once started as respiratory support in preterm infants for inclusion in this Cochrane review. The best strategy for weaning, or withdrawal, or both, of HHFNC used as a form of respiratory support in preterm infants remains unclear. Studies are required to answer these questions. Clear criteria are needed to establish a definition of stability prior to attempting to withdraw HHFNC, and for failure to withdraw/wean HHFNC.
This review includes seven studies (six low-quality and one high-quality) of four different anticonvulsants (gabapentin, carbamazepine, flunarizine and lamotrigine). We found that anticonvulsants do not have a beneficial effect in the treatment of tinnitus. Side effects of the anticonvulsants used were experienced by 18% of patients.
Twelve studies with a total of 12,168 patients were included in this review. The analyses show that, in patients with IC, antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of death from all causes, and from heart attack and stroke combined when compared with placebo. When aspirin was compared with other antiplatelet agents, there was some evidence that the alternative antiplatelet had a more beneficial effect in reducing all cause mortality or of suffering a cardiovascular event such as heart attack or stroke. However, this was based on only two trials. Antiplatelet usage, however, does increase the risk of indigestion and may also increase risk of major bleeding events. Despite its widespread use, the evidence for first line use of aspirin in patients with IC is weak and further research is required to determine whether aspirin would be better replaced by a different class of antiplatelet agent which has a greater beneficial effect with fewer side-effects.
We wanted to find out how accurate temporal artery US is at detecting features of GCA and whether it can potentially replace the biopsy altogether as one of the ACR's five criteria used for diagnosing GCA. We searched for published studies that measured the accuracy of US for diagnosing GCA and studies that also compared the accuracy of US and biopsy. We looked in depth at 16 studies with a total of 1479 participants, about 40% of whom were diagnosed as having GCA. In a group of 100 people with symptoms suggestive of GCA, we would expect 40 to actually have the condition.
If we set a threshold for US where 3 of the 60 people without the disease get a false-positive result, US will correctly identify 20 people that do have GCA, but give a false-negative result to the other 20. If a threshold is set where 12 of the 60 people without the disease get a false-positive result, US will correctly identify 34 people with GCA, but miss the remaining 6.
There were 11 studies with 808 participants in whom both US and TAB were performed and compared. In a group of 100 people where 40 have GCA and 60 do not, if a threshold is set where 3 out of the 60 people without the condition are wrongly given a positive diagnosis of GCA, US will identify 20 out of the 40 people with GCA, whereas TAB will identify 32. If a threshold is set whereby 12 of the 60 people are wrongly diagnosed as having GCA, US will identify 29 out of the 40 people with true GCA, and TAB will identify 7. These results are not reliable since most studies had flaws in the way they were designed, and their accuracy for detecting people with GCA was variable and uncertain. Additionally, as biopsy is currently part of the criteria used to diagnose GCA, it was always likely to compare favourably to US in the included studies. The evidence is current to September 2022.
This review has found no evidence of a difference between these two different operations for these outcomes. Surgery is faster with subtotal hysterectomy and there is less blood loss during or just after surgery, although these benefits are not large. With subtotal hysterectomy, women are less likely to experience fever during or just after surgery but are more likely to have long term ongoing menstrual bleeding when compared with total hysterectomy.
We included seven trials with a total of 980 participants. Five trials with 775 wake-up stroke participants were randomised to intravenous thrombolytic treatment or to control (either placebo (dummy treatment) or standard medical treatment alone). Two trials with 205 wake-up stroke participants with a blood clot in a large brain artery were randomised to either endovascular mechanical thrombectomy plus standard medical treatment or standard medical treatment alone. We found that recanalisation therapies can improve functional outcome and survival in selected patients with wake-up stroke. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that treatment increases the risk of bleeding in the brain. The optimal selection criteria with regard to imaging criteria or time window, or both, for choosing patients to treat is still unclear; these criteria differed between the trials. More trials to investigate this further are therefore warranted. We judged the included trials to be at low or unclear risk of bias, and the overall certainty of the evidence as high.
We found seven studies conducted in high-income countries including 876 adults (aged 19 to 87 years) with MESCC. Follow-up ranged from one month to three years, and the number evaluated in each varied from 29 to 303. Two studies compared different doses of radiation, two compared surgery before radiation versus radiation alone, and three small trials evaluated the effects of high-dose corticosteroids versus moderate-dose steroids or placebo.
The key results are: 1. For different doses of radiation: one dose of radiation was as effective as two doses and two doses were as effective as eight doses of radiation in adults with spinal cord compression with stable spines who are expected to live for less than six months. Adults with a better prognosis may require the longer radiation course to prevent local cancer recurrence, but the immediate benefits of shorter courses might be important for people with MESCC who have only a short time to live. No serious adverse events were noted, and the incidence of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting was low and no different with the different radiation doses. 2. For surgery before radiation: removing part of the vertebra to enlarge the spinal canal (laminectomy) before radiation offered no advantages over radiation alone. Direct decompressive surgery (directly accessing and removing affected parts of the vertebrae and, if required, fixing the spines using bone grafts and instruments) followed by radiation treatment was more effective than radiation alone in carefully selected adults younger than 65 years. Surgery plus radiation did not cause more harmful effects than radiation alone. 3. For high dose steroids: beneficial effects were not significantly different with high-dose versus moderate-dose steroids or placebo, but serious adverse effects were more frequent with high-dose steroids.
None of the studies reported on satisfaction with care or quality of life. We also did not find trials comparing different radiation doses in adults with MESCC with a good prognosis. We lacked full confidence in many results since they came from single trials or a few small trials. Also, in the study of decompressive surgery, some of the adults given radiation alone had cancers that were only moderately sensitive to radiation, and a third of patients in both intervention arms had unstable spines. In usual clinical practice, surgery, not radiation, is the preferred option in such instances. The overall GRADE quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes for the comparisons of different radiation doses and for the adverse effects of high doses of corticosteroids, indicating reasonable confidence in the results, though future research could alter the estimates in this review and our confidence in the estimates. The GRADE quality of evidence was very low for all outcomes in the comparison of laminectomy, and low for the outcome of local tumour recurrence with different radiation doses, for all outcomes in the comparison with decompressive surgery, and for the efficacy outcomes in the comparison of high-dose corticosteroids. This indicates less confidence in these results, and acknowledges that future research is likely to alter the estimates in this review. More studies are required to clarify these uncertainties and some are in progress.
We searched multiple databases to find studies that examined pharmaceutical chelating agents as treatment for ASD symptoms. We found only one randomised controlled trial that evaluated oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) for ASD, but this trial did not use ideal methods for answering our question. The evidence is current to November 2014.
The trial that we found was conducted in two phases. During the first phase, 77 children with ASD were assigned randomly to receive seven days of glutathione lotion or placebo lotion, followed by three days of oral DMSA. Forty-nine children who excreted high levels of heavy metals during phase one continued on to phase two to receive three days of oral DMSA or placebo followed by 11 days off, with the cycle repeated up to six times. Results from the included study show that multiple rounds of oral DMSA did not have an effect on any of the ASD symptoms measured in children found to be high excreters who had already received three doses of a pharmaceutical chelating agent. Currently no clinical trial evidence suggests that pharmaceutical chelation is an effective intervention for ASD. Given prior reports of serious adverse events, such as changes to calcium levels in blood, kidney impairment and reported death, risks of using pharmaceutical chelating agents for ASD currently outweigh proven benefits. The quality of the evidence is poor, with only one study, which had methodological shortcomings, included in this review. These factors, when combined, preclude confidence in the findings. However, before further trials are conducted, more evidence is needed to show that heavy metals cause or worsen the severity of autism, and the safety of pharmaceutical chelating agents for participants must be established.
This review found 81 relevant studies that recruited over 9000 participants in total. The studies mainly focussed on people having bowel surgery or caesarean section, but there were some studies of other surgery types. There were few studies of children. Most studies were of poor quality, which may mean their results are less reliable. We found some evidence that people who chewed gum after an operation were able to pass wind and have bowel movements sooner than people who did not chew gum. We also found some evidence that people who chewed gum after an operation had bowel sounds (gurgling sounds heard using a stethoscope held to the abdomen) slightly sooner than people who did not chew gum. There was a small difference in how long people stayed in hospital between people who did or did not chew gum. There were no differences in complications (such as infection or death) between people who did or did not chew gum. There was also no difference in the overall cost of treatment between people who did or did not chew gum. There is some evidence that chewing gum after surgery may help the digestive system to recover. However, the studies included in this review are generally of poor quality, which meant that their results may not be reliable. We also know that there are many factors affecting ileus, and that modern treatment plans attempt to reduce risk of ileus. Therefore to further explore using chewing gum after surgery, more studies would be needed which are larger, of better quality, include different types of surgery, and consider recent changes in health care systems.
We found no randomised clinical trials (search current until March 2017) that met the inclusion criteria of our review. Hence, the benefits and harms of thrombolysis for acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis remain unknown. Large trials using proper methods and reporting on patient-relevant outcomes are needed.
The review authors identified five randomised studies reported from 1980 to 1992. These trials recruited a total of 694 newborn infants with acute respiratory failure mainly caused by hyaline membrane disease. A long inspiratory time was associated with a significant increase in air leak from the lungs (NNT 8). There was no significant difference in the incidence of BPD but an increase in mortality before hospital discharge reached borderline statistical significance. Caution should be exercised in applying these results to modern neonatal intensive care because these studies were conducted before the introduction of antenatal steroids, postnatal surfactant and the use of synchronised modes of ventilatory support. Whilst there is increasing use of non-invasive ventilation such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury, mechanical ventilation will continue to have a role in extremely immature infants and those with hyaline membrane disease complicated by apnea.
Remaining on antidepressant medicines for one year appears to reduce the risk of depression returning from 61% to 42% but the benefits at other time intervals could not be determined. Antidepressant treatment appeared to be no more harmful than placebo as measured by number of participants dropping out of trials. The benefits of psychological therapies were not clear, due to the small number of studies. The quality of evidence was low.
The majority of participants in the studies were women. Few were over 75 years of age. Most had received treatment for their original depressive illness as outpatients, indicating less severe depression.
Antidepressant medicines used were both older type antidepressants (called tricyclics) and newer type (called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Psychological treatments were interpersonal therapy, which addresses obstacles in relationships, and cognitive behavioural therapy, which addresses inactivity and self-defeating thought patterns. This review provides limited evidence that continuing antidepressant medication for one year can reduce the risk of depression recurring with no additional harm. However, it cannot be used to make firm recommendations due to the limited number and small size of studies involved. Limitations in the design and reporting of these studies may also make the results unrepresentative. Similarly, no firm conclusions can be drawn about psychological treatments or combinations of antidepressant and psychological treatments in preventing recurrence.
Further, larger, trials are required to clarify any benefits of antidepressant and psychological treatments. These trials should include more people aged over 75, and people with other problems typical of people treated in routine clinical services, such long-term physical illness and mild memory problems.
We identified 28 randomized clinical trials. Eight trials with 4918 participants reported on risk of death, and 15 trials with 7219 participants reported on surgical site infections within 14 to 30 days of surgery. Four trials reported serious adverse events, three trials respiratory insufficiency, nine trials length of stay during the associated hospital admission and one trial quality of life. All trials were conducted without direct industry funding.
The number of participants in each trial ranged from 38 to 2012. The mean age of participants was 50 years (range 15 to 92 years) and 63% were women. Types of surgery included abdominal surgery (eight trials), caesarean section (four trials), breast surgery (one trial), orthopaedic surgery (two trials) and various other surgical procedures (four trials). A high percentage of inspired oxygen was not statistically associated with increased risk of death, or with a decrease in surgical site infections, in all trials that measured these outcomes, in trials of highest quality and in those with longest follow-up.
An increased risk of adverse events could not be proved right or wrong for a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Only five of the included trials had low risk of bias. The trials randomly assigned 9330 participants, of whom only 7537 participants provided data for this review. The number of participants required to detect or reject a 20% relative risk reduction in deaths was not reached; therefore the observed results were uncertain.
We found 14 studies involving 698 participants. Whilst all 14 studies compared broadly the analgesic efficacy of PVB and TEB in participants undergoing open thoracotomy, there were significant differences in the timing, method of insertion and medications used in PVB and TEB. This makes direct comparison difficult. Patient follow-up was limited to the immediate post-surgery period (up to five days post-surgery) with only two studies reporting long-term outcomes such as chronic pain. There are two studies awaiting classification. We found no difference between PVB and TEB in terms of death at 30 days and major complications. PVB appeared to be as effective as TEB in pain control post-surgery. TEB was associated with minor complications such as low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, itching and urinary retention when compared to PVB. We did not find any difference in length of hospital stay between PVB and TEB. There was insufficient information to assess chronic pain and health costs. We found low-quality evidence for death at 30 days, with limited information provided by only two studies reporting this outcome. We only found low to very low-quality evidence for major complications due to lack of information, with only one study reporting these outcomes. We found moderate-quality evidence for acute pain control in the immediate postoperative period. We found moderate-quality evidence for minor complications.
On 26 July 2018 we ran an electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register of trials for clinical trials that allocated people with schizophrenia randomly to receive occupational therapy provided by an occupational therapist or receive occupational therapy provided by anyone else. We identified 1633 potentially relevant records through our database searching, from which we obtained 17 full-text articles for closer inspection. We were unable to include any of these studies in the review and excluded a total of 14 studies. At present there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to permit a judgement as to whether occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists compared to anyone else. Research is needed to answer this question and to help service providers plan future services that include occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
We included 35 studies involving 2702 aged 15 to 78 years.
When compared with placebo, the duration of sensory block was prolonged in the perineural dexamethasone group by 6 and a half hours (27 studies, 1625 participants, low-quality evidence) and in the intravenous dexamethasone group by six hours (8 studies, 499 participants, moderate-quality evidence). When perineural and intravenous dexamethasone were compared, the duration of sensory block was longer in the perineural dexamethasone group by three hours (9 studies, 720 participants, moderate-quality evidence).
Postoperative pain intensity at 12 hours after surgery was lower in the perineural dexamethasone group compared with placebo (5 studies, 257 participants, very low-quality evidence) and at 24 hours after surgery (9 studies, 469 participants, low-quality evidence). When we compared intravenous dexamethasone with placebo, postoperative pain intensity was also lower in the intravenous dexamethasone group than in the placebo group at 12 hours (3 studies, 162 participants, low-quality evidence) and 24 hours (5 studies, 257 participants, low-quality evidence). The amount of opioid pain medication required was also lower in participants receiving perineural and intravenous dexamethasone. There was no difference in postoperative pain intensity or the amount of opioid pain medication required when perineural and intravenous dexamethasone were compared. We concluded that one way of administering dexamethasone does not provide better pain relief over the other.
Five serious adverse events were reported in three studies. One block-related adverse event (pneumothorax or collapsed lung) occurred in one participant in a trial comparing perineural dexamethasone and placebo; however group allocation was not reported. The remaining events were non-block-related and occurred in two trials comparing perineural dexamethasone, intravenous dexamethasone and placebo. Two participants in the control group required hospitalization within one week of surgery; one for a fall and one for a bowel infection. One participant in the placebo group developed a chronic pain syndrome called Complex Regional Pain Sydrome, and one participant in the intravenous dexamethasone group developed pneumonia. The quality of evidence for safety issues was very low.
Four studies at unclear to high risk of bias comprising 463 participants were included. The mean study duration was 7.5 months (range 3 to 18 months). None of the studies addressed our key primary outcome－'health-related quality of life'. Two of our secondary outcomes－'change from baseline in levothyroxine (i.e. thyroid hormone) replacement dosage at end of the study' and 'economic costs'－were not assessed either. One study at high risk of bias showed a statistically significant improvement in subjective well-being with sodium selenite 200 μg plus levothyroxine compared with placebo plus levothyroxine (14/18 compared with 3/18, respectively). Selenomethionine 200 μg reduced the serum levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies in three studies, and although the changes from baseline were statistically significant, their clinical relevance is unclear. Adverse events were reported in two studies, and selenium supplementation did not lead to more adverse events than were seen with placebo. One adverse event was reported in both studies in the selenomethionine 200 μg plus LT4 arm versus none in the control arm.
In conclusion, the results of these four studies do not provide enough evidence to support the use of selenium in the treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
In total, we included five randomised controlled trials involving 297 women. Three trials assessed imiquimod compared with placebo, one trial assessed imiquimod compared with cidofovir, and one compared two different doses of indole-3-carbinol. We pooled data from the three similar trials involving 104 women and found imiquimod to be more effective in clearing high-grade VIN lesions by six months than placebo. Most studies did not include longer term follow-up, but findings from one study suggested that women in whom VIN was completely cleared at six months were likely to sustain this response by 12 months. This single study showed no difference in rates of progression to cancer between study groups. We are uncertain about these longer-term findings and would like them to be corroborated by other trials. We found limited evidence on side-effects. However, evidence from one study found that side-effects, such as pain and itching of the skin over the vulva, occurred more frequently among women in the imiquimod group compared with the placebo group, and were usually managed by reducing the frequency of applications.
The trial comparing imiquimod with cidofovir involved 180 women. These topical treatments appeared to be similarly effective at six months. However, there were no longer term results available for this trial.
The trial of indole-3-carbinol was a small trial of only 13 women that compared two different doses of the medication and we could not draw any conclusions about this treatment.
We found no evidence on the effectiveness of other treatments, such as HPV vaccines to treat high-grade VIN; however, we identified five ongoing trials that may provide important evidence in the future. Imiquimod appears to be effective and reasonably safe for the treatment of VIN, and cidofovir shows considerable promise, but more research is needed. In particular, more evidence is needed on longer term effectiveness of both treatments, and on the risk of VIN progressing to vulval cancer after treatment.
This review sought to find all trials which compared any psychosocial intervention to other treatment or no treatment for pregnant or postpartum women in alcohol treatment. No articles were found which fit our inclusion criteria; most trials assessed psychosocial interventions to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnant or reproductive age women, not pregnant or post-partum women in alcohol treatment. We defined alcohol treatment as when the authors stated the women were in alcohol treatment or any validated psychosocial intervention for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Control trials need to be performed on this population of women to determine the most effective therapy for pregnant women seeking treatment for their alcohol dependence.
The review authors searched scientific databases and Internet resources to identify randomised controlled trials (in which participants were allocated at random to any anticonvulsant drug or placebo or another type of drug or non-pharmacological intervention intended to reduce,the use of cocaine). We assessed also dropout from treatment and frequency of side effects .We included people of any gender, age or ethnicity. The review authors identified 20 studies with 2068 participants, 77% male, with a mean age of 36 years. The mean duration of the trials was 11.8 weeks (range eight to 24 weeks). All but two of the trials were conducted in the USA, all with outpatients. The anticonvulsant drugs studied were carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, tiagabine, topiramate and vigabatrin. All studies compared anticonvulsants versus placebo. No significant differences were found between placebo and any anticonvulsant in reducing the number of dropouts from treatment, use of cocaine, craving and severity of dependence, depression or anxiety. Side effects were slightly more frequent in the anticonvulsant groups. No current evidence supports the clinical use of anticonvulsant medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence. The quality of the evidence was moderate for the outcomes dropout and use of cocaine, and was low for the outcomes side effects and craving. The major limitation of the trials was incomplete reporting of the methods used to protect against selection bias, randomly allocate participants to groups and conceal allocation. The evidence is current to June 2014.
Tiotropium is an inhaled medication that helps open the airways (bronchodilator) and is used to manage persistent symptoms of COPD. We found seven studies including 12,223 participants that compared tiotropium with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs), which are another type of bronchodilator. This systematic review found that currently there is insufficient evidence to suggest which of these treatments provides greater long-term benefit in quality of life. Furthermore, both treatments had similar effects on symptoms, lung function and death rates.
Tiotropium appears better than LABAs in preventing COPD exacerbations (worsening of COPD symptoms) and reducing the number of COPD-related hospitalisations. Furthermore, there were fewer participants during the study period with serious adverse events or who withdrew early from the studies with tiotropium compared with LABA treatment. However, there was no difference in the total number of people who were hospitalised.
We found six economic evaluations looking at the cost and effectiveness of tiotropium and the LABA salmeterol that were conducted in the UK, Greece, Netherlands, Spain, or USA. All the studies estimated tiotropium to be better than salmeterol based on medical outcomes (exacerbations or quality of life) and/or lower total costs, including respiratory medications and hospitalisations. However, these results were very uncertain.
We assessed all adjuvant pharmacological (drug) therapies (except corticosteroids) for which we found randomised controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) conducted in people with acute bacterial meningitis. We found eight studies examining five different interventions.
Three studies (1274 participants) evaluated paracetamol in children (excluding newborns) with bacterial meningitis. The studies were funded by government funding organisations and research foundations. One study additionally reported funding support from a daily newspaper, and one study reported funding support from a pharmaceutical company.
Two studies (49 participants) evaluated immunoglobulins in bacterial meningitis. One study included children (excluding newborns), whilst the other study included adults of unspecified age. Funding sources were not specified. One study received the study medication from a pharmaceutical company.
One study (15 participants) evaluated heparin (blood thinner) in adults with bacterial meningitis. The study was funded by a research foundation.
One study (57 participants) evaluated pentoxifylline in children (excluding newborns) with bacterial meningitis. Funding sources for the study were not specified.
One study (30 participants) evaluated a mixture of succinic acid, inosine, nicotinamide, and riboflavin mononucleotide in children (excluding newborns). Funding sources for the study were not specified. We found that paracetamol may make little or no difference for the number of deaths (paracetamol 35.2% (potentially causing between 7.1% fewer deaths up to 3.4% more deaths) versus placebo 37.4%, low certainty evidence). Paracetamol may make little to no difference in hearing loss (paracetamol 19.6% versus placebo 18.8%, low certainty evidence); neurological sequelae other than hearing loss (paracetamol 32.1% versus placebo 20.6%, low certainty evidence); or severe hearing loss (paracetamol 11.7% versus placebo 12.2%, low certainty evidence). Paracetamol may lead to slightly more short-term neurological sequelae other than hearing loss (paracetamol 15.7% versus placebo 7.9%, low certainty evidence) and slightly more long-term neurological sequelae other than hearing loss (paracetamol 8.8% versus placebo 3.8%, low certainty evidence). No side effects were reported.
The effect of immunoglobulins, heparin, pentoxifylline, and a mixture of succinic acid, inosine, nicotinamide, and riboflavin mononucleotide on number of deaths is uncertain due to the very low certainty of the evidence. No side effects were reported for immunoglobulins (very low certainty evidence), and a 3.3% rate of allergic reactions was reported in patients receiving a mixture of succinic acid, inosine, nicotinamide, and riboflavin mononucleotide (intervention group) (very low certainty evidence). None of our other outcomes (hearing loss, neurological sequelae other than hearing loss, severe hearing loss, and short-term or long-term neurological sequelae other than hearing loss) were reported in these studies. The certainty of evidence for paracetamol was low for all outcomes due to issues with study design, inconsistency of results and too few participants in the studies and sparse reporting of the outcomes of interest for this review. The certainty of evidence was very low for all other treatments due to issues with study design and not enough data. No conclusions could be drawn about the effectiveness of any of the evaluated treatments at this time because of the limited and low certainty of the evidence. This may change if results from larger studies with improved design become available.
For the present review, researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effects of gabapentin and two related drugs (pregabalin and gabapentin enacarbil) in adult patients (≥ 16 years of age) with 'episodic' migraine (headache on < 15 days per month). They examined research published up to 15 January 2013, along with three unpublished and previously confidential drug company research reports, and found six relevant studies, five of gabapentin and one of gabapentin enacarbil, both over a wide dose range. The studies showed that neither gabapentin nor gabapentin enacarbil was more effective than placebo at reducing the frequency of migraine headaches. Gabapentin commonly caused side effects, especially dizziness and somnolence (sleepiness). No studies of pregabalin were identified, and research on this drug is desirable.
The one included trial (of rivastigmine compared with placebo on 120 patients) showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups at 20 weeks. A possible beneficial effect on neuropsychiatric features was found only in analysis of observed cases, and may therefore be due to bias.
The goal was to understand how accurate ultrasound scans are in detecting structural anomalies in low-risk and unselected pregnant women when conducted in the first and second trimesters. The study also aimed to compare the accuracy of two different approaches: a single-stage screening approach involving only a second-trimester scan and a two-stage approach involving both first- and second-trimester scans. We reviewed 87 studies, covering over 7 million fetuses. These studies focused on low-risk pregnant and unselected women who had undergone first- and/or second-trimester ultrasound scans as part of routine prenatal care. We assessed the quality of the studies, extracted relevant data and used statistical methods to analyse the accuracy of the ultrasound scans. A first-trimester scan appears accurate in early detection of lethal and some severe fetal anomalies. However, its overall ability to detect anomalies is limited. In a hypothetical group of 100,000 fetuses, this scan is expected to correctly identify 113 out of 124 fetuses with lethal anomalies (91.3%) and 665 out of 1776 fetuses with any anomaly (37.5%). Unfortunately, about 79 out of 98,224 healthy fetuses (0.08%) might mistakenly receive a diagnosis of a fetal anomaly when, in reality, there isn't one (false-positive diagnosis). Although the chance of receiving a false-positive diagnosis is very low, in the cases where this occurs, this can lead to unnecessary anxiety and investigations.
The combination of a first- and second-trimester scan seems highly sensitive, expecting to identify 1448 out of 1776 cases (83.8%) before 24 weeks in a hypothetical group of 100,000 pregnancies. However, around 118 out of 98,224 healthy fetuses (0.1%) may receive a false-positive diagnosis.
Fewer fetal anomalies seem to be identified before 24 weeks in groups of women undergoing only a second-trimester scan (single-stage screening) compared to those also undergoing a first-trimester scan (two-stage screening). A single second-trimester scan is expected to detect 896 out of 1776 cases (50.5%, 592 fewer than two-stage screening), potentially resulting in false-positive diagnoses for around 205 out of 98,224 healthy fetuses (0.2%, 88 more than two-stage screening).
However, studies solely focusing on the second-trimester scan were designed differently. Women generally entered these studies after the first trimester. Easily detectable anomalies might have been identified before study entry through other investigations, leaving only the more subtle cases in the study populations. This difference may have led to underestimation of overall anomaly detection in studies assessing the accuracy of a single second-trimester scan.
It is crucial to note varying anomaly detection rates across organ systems. Abdominal wall anomalies had the highest detection rates: 95.6% (first-trimester scan), 99.0% (first- and second-trimester scan combined) and 90.8% (single second-trimester scan). Digestive tract anomalies had the lowest rates: 8.3%, 46.5% and 33.3%, respectively. The results of the included studies varied widely, making it challenging to draw consistent conclusions. Additionally, none of the studies were entirely free from potential issues in how they were conducted. Concerns mainly focused on confirming normal and abnormal prenatal findings after birth and how well the results applied to the general population, as most studies were conducted in major university hospitals. Lastly, no studies directly compared detection rates between groups receiving both scans and those with only a second-trimester scan. Although the results of the review indicate that the combination of a first- and second-trimester scan might be better at detecting anomalies before 24 weeks of pregnancy than a single second-trimester scan, this difference could be due to variations in study designs and entry times. The search for evidence was conducted up to 22 July 2022.
We identified only two randomised controlled trials, involving 71 participants, which could be included in this review. One was a small study which showed no statistically significant benefit of cartilage graft tympanoplasty over a watch and wait policy, either for disease progression or hearing. The other showed no additional benefit from the insertion of ventilation tubes ('grommets') over cartilage tympanoplasty alone for patients' hearing. Further high quality studies are much needed.
Current evidence from one randomised controlled trial indicates that betamethasone does not reduce the risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia and neonatal bleeding in ITP during pregnancy when compared to no medication. We could not identify evidence on other medical treatments for ITP during pregnancy.
This review included one controlled trial in which 38 women (41 pregnancies) were randomised, with only 26 women (28 pregnancies) being analysed. There was also a severe imbalance between comparison groups. Giving the mother betamethasone (1.5 mg/day) did not result in a difference in the neonatal platelet count at birth and at the first week of life. The study reported that the maternal platelet count of peripheral blood did not change significantly during the study period for both the betamethasone and no treatment groups. Maternal postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal intracranial haemorrhage were not studied. Nor were maternal clinical and pregnancy outcomes reported. The researchers used no treatment in the control group, which may have increased the risk of performance bias in the trial.
We included two trials with a total of 1785 participants in this review with participants whose back pain occurred suddenly and recently (acute). Most of the people in the study (90%) were middle-aged and came from a single trial that looked at acute back pain. Both trials tested paracetamol against a placebo (which contains nothing that could act as a medicine). Participants were followed between one day and 12 weeks. The main outcomes we studied were pain and disability; we also looked at quality of life, how easily people could go about their daily lives, unpleasant or unwanted side effects, how well people felt they had recovered, sleep quality, whether participants had taken the medicine as prescribed, and if it had been necessary to take ‘rescue medication’ because the paracetamol had not worked. We combined the findings from one trial (n=1651) into a single analysis (meta-analysis) that compared paracetamol to a placebo; the second trial did not report the results for the placebo, and so it could not be included. We found high-quality evidence that paracetamol (4 g per day) is no better than placebo for relieving acute LBP in either the short or longer term. It also worked no better than placebo on the other aspects studied, such as quality of life and sleep quality. About one in five people reported side effects, though few were serious, and there was no difference between intervention and control groups. As most of the participants studied were middle-aged, we cannot be sure that the findings would be the same for other age groups.
We included two trials for a total of 182 newborn infants comparing antithrombin with placebo (sugar or albumin solution). The use of antithrombin does not reduce the risks of bleeding in the brain, mortality or any other relevant outcomes in very preterm neonates when compared to placebo. However, the data collected are too limited to draw definitive conclusions on the use of antithrombin in the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain). The results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of antithrombin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question.
Three small trials of 271 babies were included in this review. The results of these studies show that it is possible to reduce the chance of serious blood infection occurring, but that almost 10 babies need to be given preventive antibiotics to avoid one case of infection. There was no difference in the likelihood of death. There were not enough data on other important effects of the antibiotics or on the possible serious side effects. There was not much similarity between the studies included in this review. Therefore, there is currently not enough evidence to recommend routinely using antibiotics in babies with central venous lines.
We wanted to find out which treatments were better than placebo (a 'dummy' or sham treatment, that looks or feels the same as the treatment being tested), or better than another treatment for:
• pain;
• function (walking-related activities);
• well-being; and
• satisfaction.
We also wanted to find out about any unwanted adverse effects. We searched for studies that looked at nonsurgical and surgical treatments compared with placebo or another treatment in people with Morton's neuroma. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 6 studies that involved 373 people with Morton's neuroma. Studies lasted from 4 weeks (1 study) to more than 12 months (3 studies), and were conducted in Europe (3), UK (2) and Asia (1).
Funding from government or university sources was reported for 2 studies.  At 3 months to 12 months, an injection of corticosteroid plus local anaesthetic (CS+LA) compared to an injection of local anaesthetic alone (LA):
• may make little to no difference to pain (2 studies, 157 people);
• may make little to no difference to function (2 studies, 157 people);
• probably makes little to no difference to well-being (1 study, 122 people);
• may make little to no difference to satisfaction (1 study, 35 people).
Unwanted effects were few in the CS+LA group and included reduction in thickness of the foot fat pad and loss of skin colour. There were no unwanted effects in the LA group.
At 3 months to 12 months, an ultrasound-guided CS+LA injection compared to a non-ultrasound-guided CA+LA injection:
• probably reduces pain (2 studies, 116 people);
• probably increases function (2 studies, 116 people);
• may increase satisfaction, (2 studies, 114 people).
These studies did not measure well-being.
There was little to no difference between these treatments for unwanted effects, which were few and included reduction in thickness of the foot fat pad and loss of skin colour. One study compared surgical removal of the neuroma via a cut through the top of the foot (dorsal neurectomy) against removal via a cut through the bottom of the foot (plantar neurectomy).
At 12 months or more, dorsal neurectomy:
• may make little to no difference to satisfaction (1 study, 73 people);
• may make little to no difference to serious unwanted effects (1 study, 75 people).
This study reported pain and function in a way we could not use, and did not measure well-being.
Unwanted effects occurred in 11 of the 75 people and included:
• plantar group: painful scar, foreign-body reaction;
• dorsal group: infection, wound reopening, blood clot in leg vein and plantar reoperation due to pain.
Studies investigating foot orthoses (shoe inserts), forefoot mobilisation and surgical neurolysis did not meet our requirements for consideration in this analysis. We have moderate to little confidence in this evidence because some studies were small, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, especially unwanted effects. We are uncertain about the accuracy of the satisfaction scale used by studies. It is possible that assessors in some studies knew which treatment they were assessing. Some studies used a different number of CS+LA injections, which could have affected the results. Further research may change our results. This evidence is up-to-date to July 2022.
Breast cancer is a common cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in women. Breast self-examination (examination of the breasts by the individual) or clinical breast examination (examination of the breasts by a doctor or a nurse) have been promoted for many years as screening methods to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage, in order to decrease the risk of dying from breast cancer. This review searched for well-designed trials that assessed these methods and found two large population-based studies involving 388,535 women who compared breast self-examination with no intervention. The review of data from these trials did not find a beneficial effect of screening in terms of improvement in breast cancer mortality. The trials showed that women who were randomised to breast self-examination were almost twice as likely to undergo a biopsy of the breast, with 3406 biopsies performed in the screening group compared to 1856 biopsies in the control group. The only large population-based trial of clinical breast examination combined with breast self-examination that was identified was discontinued. This was because of poor compliance with follow up and no conclusions can be drawn from the study.
Some women will continue with breast self-examination or will wish to be taught the technique. We suggest that the lack of supporting evidence from the two major studies should be discussed with these women to enable them to make an informed decision. Women should, however, be aware of any breast changes. It is possible that increased breast awareness may have contributed to the decrease in mortality from breast cancer that has been noted in some countries. Women should, therefore, be encouraged to seek medical advice if they detect any change in their breasts that may be breast cancer.
In addition to supportive care, treatments taken by mouth or injected include medicines that act on the immune system (e.g. etanercept) and intravenous immunoglobulins (antibodies).
We wanted to find out how well these treatments work to treat severe skin reactions. We searched for studies of all currently used treatments taken by mouth or injected to treat SJS, TEN, or SJS/TEN overlap. We were interested in studies that compared one of these treatments against another, or against supportive treatment alone to determine whether one worked better than the other. We found 9 studies in 308 people (adults and a few children), which took place in India, Europe, China, and Taiwan. We found three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). The other six studies observed the effectiveness of a treatment compared to another, without randomly assigning participants to a treatment (observational study). Most patients in the studies (where reported) had a moderate severity of disease, with 44% to 51% of their body surface area affected by rash. Studies were set in burn units, intensive care units and inpatient hospital wards. The evidence comparing no steroids to steroids came from only 2 observational studies in 56 people; we are uncertain about this result due to our lack of confidence in the evidence: on average, out of 1000 people given steroids, 232 people are at risk of dying, compared with 91 out of every 1000 not given steroids. The number of days to full skin healing and length of hospital stay were not reported.
The evidence comparing immunoglobulins to no immunoglobulins came from 1 observational study in 36 people; we are uncertain about these results due to our lack of confidence in the evidence: on average, for every 1000 people given immunoglobulins, 55 people are at risk of dying, compared with 167 of every 1000 people not given immunoglobulins. The skin of people given immunoglobulins healed almost three days faster, and people spent two days less in hospital.
Compared with steroids, etanercept may reduce the number of people who die: on average, for every 1000 people given etanercept, 83 people would die from complications of their severe skin reaction (usually infection), compared with 163 out of every 1000 people given steroids (evidence from 1 RCT in 91 participants). Unwanted side effects (such as breathing problems or severe infections) occurred in both etanercept and steroids study groups, but it was not clear if they caused participants to stop treatment. Other studies did not report on unwanted effects leading to discontinuation of treatment. The number of days to full skin healing and length of hospital stay were not reported.
The evidence comparing cyclosporin with immunoglobulins was from 1 observational study in 22 people; we are uncertain about this result due to our lack of confidence in the evidence: on average, for every 1000 people given cyclosporin, 65 people are at risk of dying, compared with 500 out of every 1000 people given immunoglobulins. The number of days to full skin healing and length of hospital stay were not reported.
No studies measured the length of stay in intensive care units. We are not confident in our results because they came from few studies with small numbers of participants. In most studies, the way in which the studies were conducted could have influenced the findings of the study. The evidence is current to March 2021.
Children in all the trials experienced a rapid, short-term reduction in pain after using ear drops. It is hard to know if this was the result of the natural course of the illness; the placebo effect of receiving treatment; the soothing effect of any liquid in the ear or the pharmacological effects of the ear drops themselves. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that when combined with oral pain medication, anaesthetic ear drops may help to relieve pain more rapidly in children aged three to 18 years. More good-quality trials are needed.
The results of seven clinical trials indicated that providing feedback from a force platform resulted in patients standing more evenly but did not improve balance during active functional activities, nor did it improve overall independence.
We found three randomised studies (randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where people are allocated at random i.e. by chance alone) involving a total of 613 women. Two studies tested methotrexate in all women with a CM and one study tested dactinomycin in women with a CM who were at a high risk of getting GTN. The two methotrexate studies are older studies that used relatively poor research methods, therefore their findings cannot be relied upon. Overall the review findings suggest that P-Chem reduces the number of women developing cancer after molar pregnancy; however, this is probably only true for women with high-risk moles (i.e. CM). In addition, P-Chem might make the time to diagnose the cancer longer and might increase the number of anti-cancer treatments needed to cure the cancer if it develops. We were unable to assess the short- and long-term side-effects of P-Chem in this review because there were not enough available data; however, we are concerned that the five- and eight-day courses of P-Chem used by researchers in these studies are too toxic to be given to women routinely. We consider this evidence to be of a low to very low quality. This conclusion is based on our assessment that two of the included studies were of poor methodological quality and at a high risk of bias; the third study was of a good quality but consisted of only 60 participants. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support giving anti-cancer drugs to women with molar pregnancies. However, GTN is almost always cured with modern care and P-Chem for molar pregnancy would only reduce the risk of needing full-scale chemotherapy, but would not remove that risk. In addition, it would not change the need for careful monitoring and follow-up of women with hydatidiform moles.
In this review, we focused on third wave CBT approaches, a group of psychological therapies that target the process of thoughts (rather than their content, as in CBT), helping people to become aware of their thoughts and to accept them in a non-judgemental way. The aim of the review was to find out whether third wave CBT was effective and acceptable to people in the acute phase of depression. The review included four studies, involving a total of 224 people. The studies examined three different forms of third wave CBT, consisting of extended behavioural activation (two studies), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (one study) and another form of third wave CBT called competitive mind training (one study). Three of the studies compared third wave CBT approaches with treatment as usual control conditions. The fourth study compared ACT with a psychological placebo condition. The results suggested that third wave CBT approaches were effective on a short-term basis in treating depression. However, the quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies/participants included in the review, together with the diverse client groups, interventions and control conditions used and possible allegiance of researchers towards the active treatments, making it difficult to draw conclusions with any confidence. It is notable, too, that none of the studies looked at the long-term effect of third wave CBT approaches. Given the increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice, further well-designed studies should be prioritised to establish whether third wave CBT approaches are helpful in treating people with acute depression.
Twenty relevant studies comprising a total of 986 participants (966 MS participants and 20 healthy controls) were identified and included in this review. Low-level evidence was found that neuropsychological rehabilitation reduces cognitive symptoms in MS. However, when analysed individually, 18 out of the 20 studies showed positive effects. Cognitive training was found to improve memory span and working memory. Cognitive training combined with other neuropsychological rehabilitation methods was found to improve attention, immediate verbal memory and delayed memory.
It is worth noting that the small numbers of patients in the studies and some methodological weaknesses reduce the level of the evidence. To further strengthen the evidence well-designed, high-quality studies are needed.
There were no data from randomised controlled trials to indicate that postoperative anticoagulation, with or without the use of mechanical devices, can safely reduce the incidence of DVT after abdominal aortic surgery. Only two randomised controlled trials that compared anticoagulants with control were found. Ninety-eight patients completed one study where one group was randomised to receive aggressive mechanical and pharmacological DVT prophylaxis while the other group did not receive any intervention. This study reported an equal DVT incidence of 2% in both groups. The trialists did not examine for calf DVT and considered it insignificant. An earlier study reported a high incidence of DVT (24% in the control group versus 8% in the heparin group) that did not reach statistical significance. All the confirmed DVT cases were in calf veins and only one case extended above the calf. The study used a regimen of calcium heparin 2500 U pre-operatively followed by 5000 U 12 hourly for seven days and was terminated early after recruiting only 49 participants because of eight cases of major bleeding. The other trial did not report any clinically-significant bleeding problems. Minor bleeding events including wound bruising and bleeding were reported in both included studies.
The reviewers evaluated the safety and effectiveness of a drug called terlipressin: they reported that terlipressin appears to be as safe as other treatments and that terlipressin may reduce the mortality from variceal bleeding as compared to placebo. The reviewers did not have sufficient data to decide whether terlipressin was better or worse than other available treatments such as other drugs (somatostatin, octreotide) or endoscopic treatment.
We found 22 studies including 23,309 participants, comparing the long-term effectiveness and side effects of tiotropium and placebo. Compared with placebo, tiotropium treatment led to an improvement in quality of life, fewer people had an exacerbation (worsening of COPD symptoms), or exacerbations leading to hospital admissions. The number of people that needed to be treated for a year, for one person to avoid one additional exacerbation was 16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 36). We found no statistically significant difference between the tiotropium and placebo groups in terms of the number of hospital admissions for any cause, serious adverse events or deaths during the studies. However, when we divided the data depending on whether a dry powder inhaler or a soft mist inhaler was used in the studies, these two subgroups were significantly different. With the dry powder inhaler there were fewer deaths in the tiotropium group than in the placebo group, whereas with the soft mist inhaler there were significantly more deaths in the tiotropium group than in the placebo group. Also, there was a larger number of participants that stopped study medication early in the placebo group than in the tiotropium group.
This review shows that treatment with tiotropium improves patients' quality of life, and reduces the risk of exacerbations, including exacerbations leading to hospitalisation. But tiotropium does not reduce hospitalisations for all causes or the number of deaths. Based on the evidence in this review, tiotropium appears to be a reasonable treatment choice for patients with stable COPD.
We searched medical databases for clinical trials looking at the potential benefits and harms of oxcarbazepine in different types of neuropathic pain and found five trials. They involved 634 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage), 145 people with neuropathic pain due to radiculopathy (pain that arises at the point where nerves leave the spinal column), and 83 people with peripheral neuropathic pain of various causes (e.g. peripheral nerve injury (injury to nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body), polyneuropathy (damage or disease affecting several peripheral nerves) and postherpetic neuralgia (pain that occurs after shingles)). The trials all compared oxcarbazepine with placebo (a pretend treatment). Four trials were funded by the manufacturer of oxcarbazepine. This review found little evidence to support the effectiveness of oxcarbazepine in painful diabetic neuropathy, neuropathic pain from radiculopathy and mixed neuropathies of various causes. Oxcarbazepine may have some effect, but we cannot be confident that the results would be the same with further studies. Side effects, including those that were serious or made people stop taking the medicine were probably more common with oxcarbazepine than placebo. We know of trials that have not reported results, for example in a form of facial pain called trigeminal neuralgia, and some of the trials we found did not report data in a form that we could analyse. We need more well-designed studies of oxcarbazepine for various types of neuropathic pain, with large numbers of participants spread over different centres (e.g. difference hospitals and clinics), and all relevant data need to be published or presented.
This is the first update of a review published in 2013. Evidence is up to date to November 2016.
This review is an update of the original review, published in 2014. After searching the medical literature up to August 2020, we found no new studies this time. We kept the two studies from the original review. –a drug commonly used in gout in an effort to reduce the uric acid levels in blood. Both studies enrolled people with gout who were predominantly middle-aged men. In the skim milk study, participants appeared to have severe gout, as they had frequent attacks, and 20% to 43% presented with tophi. Participants in the vitamin C study appeared similar to ordinary people with gout. Gout attacks
People who drank enriched skim milk powder for three months had 0.21 fewer gout attacks per month (from 0.76 fewer to 0.34 more), or 2.5 fewer gout attacks per year:
- People who drank enriched skim milk powder had 0.49 gout attacks per month (or six gout attacks per year).
- People who drank standard skim milk powder or lactose had 0.70 gout attacks per month (or eight gout attacks per year).
Withdrawals due to adverse events
Four more people out of 100 who drank enriched skim milk powder discontinued the supplement by three months (4% more withdrawals).
- 18 out of 100 stopped drinking enriched skim milk powder.
- 14 out of 100 stopped drinking standard skim milk powder or lactose.
Number of adverse events
People who drank enriched skim milk powder for three months had lesser adverse events (1% lesser adverse events)
- 47 out of 100 people who drank enriched skim milk powder had an adverse event.
- 48 out of 100 people who drank standard skim milk powder or lactose had an adverse event.
Effects on serum uric acid levels, joint pain, and overall assessment by participants were uncertain. The effect on the disappearance of tophus was not measured. Serum uric acid levels
- People who took vitamin C showed a reduction in serum uric acid levels of 0.014 mmol/L after eight weeks (or 2.8% reduction)
- People who took allopurinol showed a reduction in serum uric acid levels of 0.118 mmol/L after eight weeks (or 23.6% reduction).
There were no reports of side effects or withdrawals due to side effects in either treatment group.
Effects of vitamin C on gout attacks, pain reduction, overall assessment by participants, and tophus disappearance were not measured. Overall, we found low-quality evidence in both trials. We reduced the quality of the evidence because the trials were poorly conducted and reported, the sample sizes were small, and the results suggested both benefits and harms for most outcomes. Low-quality evidence from one study indicated that enriched skim milk, compared with standard skim milk or lactose powder, may not reduce the frequency of gout attacks or improve uric acid levels, but may reduce pain. Further research is likely to change these estimates. We do not have precise information about side effects and complications, but possible side effects may include nausea, bloating or diarrhoea.
Compared with the commonly used medicine, allopurinol, low-quality evidence from one study showed that vitamin C reduced serum uric acid levels less; the difference was probably clinically unimportant. Other possible benefits of vitamin C are uncertain, as they were not evaluated in the study. No side effects were reported. Further research is likely to change these estimates.
We wanted to evaluate the effects of following these diets in people with overweight or obesity. We checked the effects on weight, quality of life, side effects, and death. We looked for studies that compared the effects of these diets in adults with overweight or obesity with other diets, including high glycaemic index or high glycaemic load diets (diets that would produce a higher peak in blood sugar). The studies had to have a follow-up of at least 8 weeks. We included 10 studies with 1210 people (4.1% of participants were children and 1.9% were adults over 65 years old). Half of the studies were carried out in the USA, and there was one study each in Australia, Iran, Mexico, New Zealand, and Spain. Low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets compared to higher glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets
Low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight. Results indicated that a low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diet may improve mood, but the actual effect is likely substantially different from the estimate of the effect. None of the participants experienced unwanted or harmful effects. None of the studies reported on deaths.
Low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets compared to any other diets
Low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets likely result in little to no difference in body weight change compared to other diets. Participants in the studies reported experiencing unwanted effects, including eating disorders, kidney stones, and diverticulitis (infection or inflammation of pouches that can form in your intestines; the pouches are called diverticula). These effects may or may not have been caused by the intervention. None of the studies for this comparison reported on participants' quality of life or deaths. We were most certain about the findings related to weight, but there were greater uncertainties for other results. Not all studies reported what happened regarding participants' quality of life and deaths, and most of the studies were very small. Also, participants in many studies knew which diets they received, which might have influenced how they lived during the study and how the study outcomes were measured. The evidence is up to date to May 2022.
This update of the review of available clinical trials found that the risk of developing active TB was reduced when people infected with both HIV and TB used isoniazid. Isoniazid for latent TB is usually taken for six to 12 months, but more research is still needed to show optimal duration of treatment, the best treatment regime for people with HIV, and especially the best regimen in combination with HIV drugs.
This review assessed the effect of hormone replacement on treatment of osteoporosis in women with primary biliary cirrhosis. We found no evidence of effect of hormone replacement on mortality and fractures in women with primary biliary cirrhosis. It seems that hormone replacement given to women with primary biliary cirrhosis is connected with a significant increase in the occurrence of adverse events compared with placebo or no intervention. Hormone replacement appears to have no effect on the lumbar bone mineral density compared with placebo or no intervention. Hormone replacement may decrease bone mineral density measured at the proximal femur. We did not find evidence to support the use of hormone replacement for osteoporosis in women with primary biliary cirrhosis.
We considered twenty four studies for inclusion in this review. This review identified twenty randomised controlled trials enrolling a total of (2334) participants which compared an intervention using phlebotonics with a control intervention. Of these twenty studies, one study compared phlebotonics with a medical intervention and another with rubber band ligation. Of the remaining four trials, we identified two trials which compared phlebotonics with each other, one trial which compared phlebotonics with herbal therapy and one trial which compared phlebotonics with infrared photocoagulation. The trials obtained did not show any significant adverse events or side-effects from the use of phlebotonics. The studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of phlebotonics in treating the symptoms and signs of haemorrhoidal disease as well as symptom relief post-haemorrhoidectomy.
The review authors searched the medical literature to determine how effective and safe corticosteroids are for treating brain injury. They focused their search on randomised controlled trials in which one group of people received a medical treatment (corticosteroids) and was compared with a similar group who received a different treatment or no treatment other than standard care. The review authors found 20 of these studies with 12,303 participants. When the review was first done the results of the research were inconclusive. A new large study with about 80% of the total participants was completed by the time of the 2006 update of this review. This study, called CRASH, showed a significant increase in number of deaths in patients given steroids compared with patients who received no treatment. The significant increase in deaths with steroids suggests that steroids should no longer be routinely used in people with traumatic head injury.
Rimonabant is the first drug of a new class of medications that seems to reduce body weight and improve risk factors for diseases of the blood vessels and heart in people who are overweight or obese. We found four studies which evaluated weight loss, occurrence of disorders and adverse effects of treatment. The four studies involved 6625 people comparing rimonabant 20 mg with rimonabant 5 mg and placebo, in combination with a hypocaloric diet after one or two years of treatment. Greater weight loss and improvement in risk factors were seen after 20 mg of rimonabant. These results have to be interpreted with caution though, due to high discontinuation rates of study participants and the overall low quality of the included studies. 
We conclude that: 1. average weight loss with rimonabant appears modest, and 2. more rigorous studies examining the efficacy and safety of rimonabant are required to fully evaluate the benefit risk ratio of this new drug. 
In Europe, rimonabant is contraindicated for patients with severe depression and/or patients who are treated with antidepressive medications. Rimonabant is furthermore not recommended for patients with other untreated psychiatric conditions.
We reviewed the literature to evaluate the preventive effect of blunt needles compared to sharp needles on needle stick injuries among surgical staff. We searched multiple medical databases (to May 2011). We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of blunt versus sharp suture needles for preventing needle stick injuries among surgical staff. We located 10 RCTs with 2961 operations in which blunt needles were compared to sharp needles. Six studies focused on abdominal operations, two on vaginal repair and two on hip replacement. On average, a surgeon that used sharp needles sustained one glove perforation per three operations. The use of blunt needles reduced the risk of glove perforations by 54% (95% confidence interval 46% to 62%) compared to sharp needles. The use of blunt needles in six operations will thus prevent one glove perforation. In four studies the use of blunt needles also reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries by 69% (95% confidence interval 14% to 68%). Even though surgeons reported that the force needed for the blunt needles was higher, their use of the needles was still rated as acceptable in five out of six studies. We concluded that there is high quality evidence that the use of blunt needles appreciably reduces the risk of contracting infectious diseases for surgeons and their assistants over a range of operations by reducing the number of needle stick injuries. It is unlikely that future research will change this conclusion.
This review of 13 trials on diabetic and alcoholic peripheral neuropathy with a total of 741 participants showed only one study that suggested possible short-term benefit from eight-week treatment with benfotiamine (a derivative of vitamin B1) with slightly greater improvement in vibration perception threshold compared to placebo. Vitamin B complex when given in a higher dose administered for four weeks was more efficacious than a lower dose in reducing pain and other clinical problems based on another study. Two to eight weeks of treatment with vitamin B was less efficacious than alpha-lipoic acid, cilostazol or cytidine triphosphate in short-term improvement of clinical and nerve test findings. All these findings require confirmation in larger studies before they can be accepted as definite. Vitamin B is generally well-tolerated with only a few reports of mild side effects.
This review includes 108 randomised controlled trials with 23,407 participants. These were carried out in 25 countries. On average, participants were 76 years old and 77% were women. The majority of trials had unclear or high risk of bias, mainly reflecting lack of blinding of trial participants and personnel to the interventions. This could have influenced how the trial was conducted and outcome assessment. The certainty of the evidence for the overall effect of exercise on falls was high. Risk of fracture, hospitalisation, medical attention and adverse events were not well reported and, where reported, the evidence was low- to very low-certainty. This leads to uncertainty regarding drawing conclusions from the evidence for these outcomes. Eighty-one trials compared exercise (all types) versus a control intervention that is not thought to reduce falls in people living in the community (who also had not recently been discharged from hospital). Exercise reduces the number of falls over time by around one-quarter (23% reduction). By way of an example, these data indicate that if there were 850 falls in 1000 people followed over one year, exercise would result in 195 fewer falls. Exercise also reduces the number of people experiencing one or more falls (number of fallers) by around one-sixth (15%) compared with control. For example, if there were 480 fallers who fell in 1000 people followed over one year, exercise would result in 72 fewer fallers. The effects on falls were similar whether the trials selected people who were at an increased risk of falling or not.
We found exercise that mainly involved balance and functional training reduced falls compared with an inactive control group. Programmes involving multiple types of exercise (most commonly balance and functional exercises plus resistance exercises) probably reduced falls, and Tai Chi may also reduce falls. We did not find enough evidence to determine the effects of exercise programmes classified as being mainly resistance exercises, dance, or walking programmes. We found no evidence to determine the effects of programmes that were mainly flexibility or endurance exercise.
There was considerably less evidence for non-fall outcomes. Exercise may reduce the number of people experiencing fractures by over one-quarter (27%) compared with control. However, more studies are needed to confirm this. Exercise may also reduce the risk of a fall requiring medical attention. We did not find enough evidence to determine the effects of exercise on the risk of a fall requiring hospital admission. Exercise may make very little difference to health-related quality of life. The evidence for adverse events related to exercise was also limited. Where reported, adverse events were usually non-serious events of a musculoskeletal nature; exceptionally one trial reported a pelvic stress fracture and a hernia.
We searched for all relevant studies that compared mouth rinses used before dental procedures against placebo (fake treatment), no intervention or another mouth rinse considered to be inactive. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed our confidence in the evidence. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies used chlorhexidine, CPC, essential oil/herbal mouth rinses, povidone iodine and boric acid in comparison to no rinsing, or rinsing with water, saline (salt water) or another mouth rinse. None of the studies measured the how often dental healthcare providers became infected with micro-organisms. All the included studies measured the level of bacterial contamination in droplets or aerosols in the dental clinic. They did not examine contamination with viruses or fungi.
Most rinses decreased bacterial contamination in aerosols to some extent, but there was considerable variation in the effects and we do not know what size of reduction is necessary to reduce infection risk.
The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro-organisms in the patient's mouth or side effects such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess whether patients were happy to use a mouth rinse or whether it was easy for dentists to implement.
Overall, the results suggest that using a preprocedural mouth rinse may reduce the level of bacterial contamination in aerosols compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water, but we have only low or very low certainty that the evidence is reliable and we do not know how this reduction in contamination relates to the risk of infection. We have very little confidence in the evidence, and further studies may change the findings of our review. No studies measured infection risk or investigated viral or fungal contamination. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to February 2022.
This review includes 10 small and flawed trials that recruited a total of 388 people with chronic ankle instability. Limitations in the design, conduct and reporting of these trials meant that it was difficult to be certain that their results were valid.
Three trials compared neuromuscular training with no training. These found a programme of neuromuscular training appears to provide short term improvement in functional stability. One trial testing the use of a special cycle pedal found that it did not make an important difference to function. However, none of these four trials followed-up patients after the end of treatment.
Four trials compared different types of surgical intervention. There was insufficient evidence to strongly support any specific surgical procedure for treating chronic ankle instability. Two trials found that, after surgical reconstruction, early functional rehabilitation enabled patients to return to work and sports quicker than six weeks immobilisation.
This review examined whether there was any evidence for using methylxanthines in children with non-specific cough. There were no randomised controlled trials that assessed methylxanthines for prolonged non-specific cough in children. In four non-randomised controlled studies, the researchers described that dramatic improvements in cough were seen within 2-14 days of taking oral theophylline. However, this is possibly a placebo and/or time period effect. There is no RCT evidence to support the routine use of methylxanthines for the symptom of non-specific cough in children. Further research examining the effects of methylxanthines using child appropriate cough outcome measures are needed.
The purpose of this review was to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of auditory integration therapy and therapies like it that have been developed to improve abnormal sound sensitivity and autistic behaviours in such individuals. Seven relatively small studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. These often measured different outcomes and reported mixed results. Benefits for participants receiving auditory integration therapy were only reported in two studies, involving 35 participants, for two outcomes. A study of Tomatis therapy did not measure behavioural outcomes and did not find any difference in language development between intervention and control groups. As such, there is no evidence to support the use of auditory integration therapy or other sound therapies at this time.
We wanted to examine and compare two different approaches to administering the loop diuretics: slow administration over an extended period of time (continuous) and administering the loop diuretic in several individual doses (bolus) to assess if one delivery method was better than the other. We scrutinised over 3400 journal articles and identified seven trials that met our criteria for analysis. We evaluated these trials for any reported changes in bodyweight, probability of death (mortality), duration of hospitalisation, chance of readmission to hospital after being discharged, and whether one delivery method had any harmful effects on the kidneys compared to the other. We identified seven studies involving 681 adults aged over 18 years who received treatment in a hospital. The participants' average age ranged from 57 to 82 years. These studies were conducted across 32 hospitals in the USA, Canada, Spain, Sweden, India, Turkey, and China between 2010 and 2021, with data collection durations spanning from eight months to six years. The largest study involved 308 participants, while the smallest included 40 participants.
After our analysis, we found that intervention with either delivery method, continuous or bolus, may make little to no difference in:
– change in bodyweight (evidence from 5 studies in 497 people);
– probability of mortality (evidence from 5 studies in 530 people);
– duration of hospitalisation (evidence from 4 studies in 211 people);
– chance of readmission to hospital after being discharged (evidence from 3 studies in 400 people);
– harmful effects on the kidneys (evidence from 3 studies in 491 people).
Overall, we have little confidence in the evidence because the numbers of studies and participants were small and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Despite reviewing numerous journal articles, only seven studies met the criteria to answer our question. Some of the included studies had sections that were not described well, and made the evidence less reliable. This evidence is up to date to 29 February 2024.
We wanted to know whether medically administered fluids help adults in the end stage of illness.
We were interested in the effect of medically administered fluids on:
- the quality of life (well-being) of people;
- how long they lived; and
- the development of any unwanted or harmful effects. We searched for studies that investigated whether:
- medically assisted fluids compared to placebo with non-therapeutic amounts of fluid; or
- medically assisted fluids compared to standard care including good mouth care to alleviate the sensation of thirst
was effective and whether it caused any unwanted effects in adults over 18 years of age who were receiving palliative care in the end stage of illness.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 4 studies that involved a total of 422 people. Two studies compared medically administered fluids to placebo, and two compared medically administered fluids to standard care. The largest study was in 200 people, and the smallest study was in 42 people; studies lasted between 2 and 14 days. The age of people in the studies ranged from 28 to 98 years, of whom 226 were women and 196 were men. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, including the UK, the USA, and Argentina. Two studies were funded by clinical research grants. We found no studies where people did not have an advanced cancer diagnosis. In adults receiving medically administered fluids in the end stage of illness, compared to placebo:
- we are uncertain whether medically administered fluids improve quality of life;
- we are uncertain whether medically administered fluids increase how long people live, and whether they lead to the development of any unwanted or harmful effects.
In people receiving medically administered fluids in the end stage of illness, compared to standard care:
- we are uncertain whether medically administered fluids improve quality of life due to lack of information in the included studies;
- we are uncertain whether medically administered fluids increase how long people lived, and whether they lead to the development of any unwanted or harmful effects. We are not confident in the evidence, and the results of further research could differ from the results of this review. Three main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in, as we only found studies that included people with advanced cancer. Secondly, studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes. Finally, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, which could have introduced bias. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to November 2022.
We found that very little work had been done in this area; only three studies were suitable for inclusion. More than 300 participants were included in all. Each study involved a rehabilitation programme between 30 and 90 minutes long, provided once or twice weekly and starting six to 12 weeks after surgery.
We found that specially designed exercise programmes for people who have had back decompression surgery can help to reduce back pain and can improve their ability to carry out everyday tasks. This was true both in the short term (within six months of surgery) and over the long term (at 12 months). Because only three studies were suitable to be included, we cannot be certain that future studies will not change these conclusions.
We found eight studies that included 582 people with COPD who experienced a flare-up that required extra treatment in hospital. These studies compared oral or injected corticosteroid treatment given for seven or fewer days versus treatment for longer than seven days. Most of the people in these studies were in their late sixties and had severe or very severe symptoms of COPD; more men than women took part. The last search for studies to be included in the review was conducted in March 2017.
No differences were observed between shorter and longer courses of treatment. People treated for seven or fewer days did not have a higher rate of treatment failure or longer time to their next exacerbation; the number of people who avoided treatment failure ranged from 51 fewer to 34 more per 1000 treated (average 22 fewer people per 1000). Time in hospital and lung function (blowing tests) at the end of treatment were not different. No differences in side effects or death were noted between treatments. Information on quality of life, which is an important outcome for people with COPD, is limited, as only one study measured it.
The eight studies included in this review were generally well designed, and the quality of the evidence was rated as moderate because of imprecision in results; more research, especially involving people with less severe COPD, is needed.
We updated the search on 30 June 2016. We identified three studies, with a total of 1915 babies. One study could not be included in the analysis and so findings are based on two studies involving 1302 infants. The mothers in the studies were motivated to breastfeed recruited immediately after birth and at two weeks of life, respectively. We found that unrestricted use of a pacifier did not affect the proportion of infants exclusive or partial breastfeeding at three and four months. The studies were remarkably consistent. We judged this to be moderate-quality evidence. There was no information on the effect of pacifier use on any breastfeeding difficulties experienced by the mothers, maternal satisfaction, infant crying and fussing and infant problems such as otitis media and dental malocclusion. In motivated mothers, there is moderate-quality evidence that pacifier use in healthy term breastfeeding infants before and after lactation is established does not reduce the duration of breastfeeding up to four months of age. However, there is insufficient information on the potential harms of pacifiers on infants and mothers. Until further information becomes available on the effects of pacifiers on the infant, mothers who are well-motivated to breastfeed should be encouraged to make a decision on the use of a pacifier based on personal preference.
In this review we set out to examine all the evidence on how well paracetamol (alone or with morphine-like drugs) worked in adults and children with cancer pain. We also wanted to know how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were, for example, whether they caused people to stop taking their medicines.
In March 2017, we found three studies with 122 participants. All compared paracetamol plus opioid with the same dose of opioid alone. The studies were small, and were of poor quality. They used different study designs and different ways of showing their pain results. Outcomes of importance to people with cancer pain were not reported. We found no evidence that taking paracetamol alone made any difference to the level of pain experienced. We found no evidence that taking paracetamol together with a morphine-like drug was better than the morphine-like drug alone. Paracetamol did not appear to improve quality of life. No conclusions could be reached about side effects. The amount of information and the differences in how studies were reported meant that no conclusions could be made. The quality of the evidence was very low. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the impact of paracetamol for treating cancer pain. We do not know whether using paracetamol alone, or in combination with an opioid such as codeine or morphine, is worthwhile.
We wanted to find out if androgens (DHEA or T) as an adjunct treatment is better than placebo ('dummy' treatment), no treatment, or any other active treatment for improving:
- live birth rate/ongoing pregnancy ('live birth' is defined as the delivery of a live fetus after 20 completed weeks of gestational age; 'ongoing pregnancy' is defined as evidence of a gestational sac with fetal heart activity at 12 weeks or later, confirmed by ultrasound);
- miscarriage rate (defined as the number of pregnancies lost before 20 weeks of gestation);
- clinical pregnancy (defined as evidence of a gestational sac with fetal heart activity after six weeks of gestation, confirmed by ultrasound).
We also wanted to know if androgens (DHEA or T) used with ART affected the risk of:
- unwanted effects on the woman including ectopic pregnancy and complications during pregnancy or labour;
- unwanted effects on the fetus, including fetal anomalies. We searched for all published and unpublished studies comparing androgens (DHEA or T) as an adjunct treatment versus any other active treatment, placebo, or no treatment in women undergoing ART. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 28 studies involving a total of 3002 women. Participants were women with infertility of greater than one year in all included studies. Fourteen studies looked at DHEA, and 14 looked at T.
- T probably improves the chances of a successful pregnancy in women identified as poor responders to IVF.
- DHEA likely has little to no effect on the chances of a successful pregnancy in women identified as poor responders to IVF.
- Androgens (DHEA and T) likely do not decrease a woman's chance of miscarriage. It is uncertain if DHEA and T increase the chance of multiple pregnancy. Overall, we are only moderately confident in the evidence because people involved in the studies may have been aware of treatment assignment; the numbers of events were low; and study methods were poorly reported. Information on unwanted effects was very limited, and any reported events were minor. Further research is needed to identify the optimal duration of treatment with T. Future studies should collect data on unwanted effects and multiple pregnancy. This review updates a previous review. The evidence is current to January 2024.
The review authors could not find any studies that adequately assessed these interventions. This means that there needs to be more studies, not necessarily that the interventions are not helpful.
Older people who were not able to make decisions due to medical conditions were excluded from the review.
We wanted to find out which material works better for retrograde filling in root canal therapy, and whether they are associated with any unwanted (adverse) effects. We searched for studies that compared different materials used for retrograde filling in root canal therapy. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found eight studies with a minimum duration of 12 months that involved 1399 people (1471 teeth) over 17 years of age undergoing retrograde filling using different types of filling material.
The evidence:
- is not robust enough to determine which material is best to use in retrograde filling.
No studies investigated the unwanted effects of any of the materials. The main limitations of the evidence are that studies:
- were very small;
- were conducted in ways that may have introduced errors into their results; and
- there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.
Due to these limitations, we have little confidence in the evidence. The evidence is up to date to April 2021.
Evidence from this review of 630 people in two trials suggests that, in patients with polycythaemia vera and with no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin therapy, low-dose aspirin may reduce the risk of thrombotic and all-cause mortality. No data were provided on mortality from bleeding episodes. No studies in participants with essential thrombocythaemia and with antiplatelet therapy other than aspirin have been published.
We wanted to find out if any method of prolapse repair (native tissue repair, transvaginal permanent mesh repair, transvaginal graft repair) was better than the other. We also wanted to identify any associated adverse (harmful or unwanted) effects of each method of prolapse repair. This is a review update; the previous version was published in 2016. We searched for studies that compared any type of transvaginal graft repair with any other transvaginal repair (traditional native tissue suture repair, repair with grafts) for the management of vaginal prolapse (first occurrence or repeat). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods. We found 51 studies involving 7846 women. The studies were conducted in 19 countries around the world. The women having surgery ranged in age from 39 to 91 years old. Most had had 2 to 3 children. All permanent meshes were made of polypropylene, except for 1 study which used polytetrafluoroethylene, commonly known by its trade name of Teflon. Compared to native tissue repair, transvaginal permanent mesh repair:
• probably reduces the number of women who are aware (i.e. experience symptoms) of prolapse at 6 months to 7 years after surgery;
• probably reduces the number who need repeat surgery specifically for prolapse;
• may lead to a higher rate of repeat surgery for prolapse, incontinence, or mesh erosion (when mesh protrudes through the surgery cut and into the vagina) when considered together. If 7.1% of women undergoing native tissue repair require any repeat surgery, between 7.6% and 16% of women will require repeat surgery after transvaginal permanent mesh repair.
• probably results in more bladder injuries and new incontinence problems.
The most common reason women have permanent mesh implants removed is pain, rather than mesh erosion. Only 1 study in this review reported on women who had mesh removed due to pain.
We conclude that while the use of transvaginal permanent mesh is not supported in most cases, there may be isolated scenarios where women may benefit from this surgical option, due to their particular health and bodily conditions. In these scenarios, transvaginal permanent mesh should be used in compliance with national organisations that regulate medical devices and local ethics committees.
Our conclusions are largely the same as in the 2016 version of this review. We have more confidence in some results because more women have been involved in the studies we analysed. Overall, the quality of the evidence was largely moderate (very low to moderate). The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods, inconsistency in reporting, and variability in outcomes. The evidence is current to March 2022.
This review assesses the various forms of medication used to treat the condition. Nineteen randomised controlled trials were included (3382 participants). Most were of low quality. The findings of the review may not be wholly relevant to primary care as most of the trials were conducted in a hospital setting and over half involved ear cleaning as part of the treatment (this is generally not available in primary care). However, the review does demonstrate that topical treatments alone are effective at treating acute otitis externa. There was little to choose between them in terms of effectiveness. However, when treatment needs to be extended beyond one week acetic acid drops appear to be less effective than antibiotic/steroid drops. In addition, symptoms persist for two days longer in those treated with acetic acid. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of steroid-only drops. Patients treated with antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun.
We searched for studies up to 4 February 2019. This review included 34 studies that involved 1795 people with ID and 354 carers. Nineteen studies randomly allocated participants to two or more groups (i.e. randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and 15 were non-randomised studies (NRS).
The studies assessed different ways to improve the oral hygiene of people with ID: special manual toothbrushes; electric toothbrushes; oral hygiene training for carers; oral hygiene training for people with ID; varying the scheduled intervals between dental visits and supervising toothbrushing; using discussion of clinical photographs as a motivator; varying how frequently the teeth of people with ID were brushed; using a plaque-disclosing agent and using individualised oral care plans.
The studies evaluated gingival inflammation (red and swollen gums) and plaque. Some studies evaluated carer knowledge, behaviour, attitude and self-efficacy (belief in their competence) in terms of oral hygiene, as well as the oral hygiene behaviour and skills of people with ID. Tooth decay and quality of life were not measured. We grouped the studies according to when the outcomes were measured: short term (six weeks or less), medium term (between six weeks and 12 months) and long term (more than 12 months). A special manual toothbrush (the Superbrush), used by carers, may be better at reducing levels of gingival inflammation and possibly plaque in people with ID than an ordinary manual toothbrush in the medium term, though this was not seen in the short term.
We found no difference between electric and manual toothbrushes used by people with ID or their carers in terms of gingival inflammation or plaque in the medium term, and the short-term results were unclear.
Training carers to brush the teeth of people with ID may have improved carers' oral hygiene knowledge in the medium term.
Training people with ID to brush their own teeth may have reduced the amount of plaque on their teeth in the short term.
Regularly scheduled dental recall visits and carers supervising toothbrushing between visits may have been more likely than usual care to reduce gingival inflammation and plaque in the long term.
Discussing clinical photographs of plaque on participants' teeth shown up by a disclosing agent, to motivate them to better toothbrushing did not seem to reduce plaque.
Daily toothbrushing by a dental student may be more effective for reducing plaque levels in the short term than once or twice weekly professional toothbrushing.
Toothpaste with a plaque-disclosing agent and individualised oral care plans were each evaluated in one nonrandomised study that suggested they may be beneficial.
Only one study set out to formally measure negative side effects; however, most studies commented that there were none. Some studies found that some people had difficulties with the electric or special manual toothbrushes. Although some oral hygiene interventions for people with ID show scientific evidence of benefits, what these benefits actually mean for an individual's oral hygiene or oral health is unclear. The certainty of the evidence is mainly low or very low so future research may change our findings. Moderate-certainty evidence is available for only one finding: electric and manual toothbrushes are probably similarly effective for reducing gingival inflammation in people with ID in the medium term. More and better research is needed to fully evaluate interventions that show promise for improving the oral hygiene of people with ID, and to confirm which interventions are ineffective. In the meantime, changes to current habits based on this review should be made cautiously, and decisions about oral hygiene care should be based on professional expertise and the needs and preferences of people with ID and their carers.
Experimental studies suggest that ultrasound can help the effect of clot dissolving treatment (thrombolysis) in acute stroke. This systematic review was designed to find out whether adding ultrasound to clot-dissolving (thrombolytic) drugs or to conventional treatment (sonothrombolysis) is safe and effective. We identified five randomised trials with a total number of  233 participants. People treated with sonothrombolysis appeared to have a greater chance of independent survival (although with some statistical uncertainty), and had more chance of opening blocked blood vessels without an increased risk of bleeding (intracranial haemorrhage). When small bubbles (microbubbles or nanobubbles) are added to sonothrombolysis, the risk of haemorrhage may increase. More research is needed to find out if sonothrombolysis is safe and effective and if there are subgroups of patients who will benefit more from this type of treatment.
This review synthesized the results of five randomized controlled trials of social skills groups including 196 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (aged 6 to 21 years). We found individuals receiving treatment showed some indications of improved social competence and better friendships when compared with those not receiving treatment. Participants receiving treatment also showed indications of less loneliness. The ability to recognize different emotions was measured in two studies and there was no evidence that it was improved by taking part in a social skills group. Social communication as it relates to idiomatic expressions was only reported in one study and no significant differences between treatment and control group were found. Nor was there evidence of a beneficial effect of social skills groups on parental or child depression. No adverse effects were reported in the studies. Limitations of this review include a small number of studies and participants, and a high risk of bias due to parents knowing whether their child was in the intervention group or not. The studies focused mainly on children with ASD aged 7 to 12 with average or above average intelligence, and they were all carried out in the US.
This review examined 20 trials including 1,811 participants which compared insulin monotherapy with insulin in combination with oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA) in insulin-requiring patients with type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that a bedtime NPH insulin-oral hypoglycaemic agent combination therapy regimen provides comparable glycaemic control to insulin monotherapy. Due to lack of studies it remains unclear whether insulin-OHA combination regimens with metformin alone are superior to those with metformin plus a sulphonylurea. In most cases no significant differences in hypoglycaemic events were observed between insulin mono- and OHA combination therapy. No study assessed diabetes-related morbidity or mortality.
This review found that there was not enough evidence from good quality randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use and type of disposable napkins for the prevention of napkin dermatitis in infants. Better studies need to be done.
We found 30 trials, with a total of 1569 participants, and the interventions included changes to ventilator type and settings, earplugs and eye masks, relaxation therapy, sleep-inducing music, massage, foot baths, aromatherapy, valerian acupressure, sound masking, and changing the visiting times of family members. We assessed the effects of these interventions on sleep outcomes (e.g., quality and amount of sleep), length of stay in the ICU, the occurrence of delirium, other adverse events, and death. Overall, the quality of the evidence for an effect of the interventions on any of the outcomes was low or very low. Normally, we would try to pool findings from similar trials of each intervention, but this was difficult because the design of the trials varied greatly. We were able to combine the results from three trials of earplugs and eye masks and found that their use increased the number of hours slept and prevented delirium in adults in the ICU. However, we cannot be certain about these findings because of problems with how the trials were carried out.
There was also some low quality evidence from four studies that music may improve subjective sleep quality and quantity, but we could not pool the data. Similarly, a low number of studies found that relaxation techniques, foot massage, acupressure, nursing or social intervention, and sound masking can provide small improvements in participant-reported or nurse-assessed sleep quality and quantity, but the quality of the evidence was low. The effects of the interventions on objective sleep outcomes (e.g., sleep measured by a machine) varied: the majority of studies that looked at the use of earplugs and eye masks found no benefit, and although the results from six trials of ventilator modes suggested that certain ventilator settings might offer benefits over others, the results of the individual trials did not always agree with each other. Only one study measured length of stay in the ICU and found no significant effect of earplugs plus eye masks. None of the included studies looked at economic outcomes, risk of post-traumatic stress disorder, or deaths. The trials did not clearly report adverse effects, although there was very low quality evidence that ventilator mode might influence certain adverse effects that can happen when people are on a ventilator. In summary, further well-designed and conducted research is needed to strengthen the evidence for the use of these interventions for improving sleep in critically ill adults.
We included 25 trials in the review. Fourteen trials used family-based therapy, one used systems family therapy, one used structural family therapy and seven studies used therapy with family involvement but did not provide specific details about the theory behind the therapy or its procedures, termed other family therapy. Two studies included two family therapy arms each: one included family-based therapy and systems family therapy arms, and one included systems family therapy and other family therapy arms. Four studies compared family therapy approaches to treatment as usual, six compared family therapy approaches to other psychological interventions and two compared family therapy to educational interventions. Twelve studies compared various forms of family therapy approaches to each other. Two studies included both a treatment as usual as well as other psychological intervention arms. Overall there was some low-quality evidence from only two trials to suggest that family therapy approaches may be better than treatment as usual in the short term. The size and very low quality of the evidence base and the consistency of the trial outcomes are insufficient at this time to draw conclusions about whether family therapy approaches offer any clear advantage over educational or psychological interventions. We found very few differences between treatment groups on measures of weight, eating disorder symptoms and family functioning, and these differences were generally not maintained at follow-up. The reporting of death rates was not clear enough to assess whether death is reduced for those treated with family therapy approaches compared to other interventions. There was very little information about the effects of the interventions on general or family functioning. The way the trials were run was not adequately described in many studies and we found potential risks of bias in most of the studies. This limited the meaningful conclusions that we could draw from the studies. Overall, there is a very limited evidence base in this field. There is some low-quality evidence to suggest that family therapy approaches may be effective compared to treatment as usual in the short term. There is insufficient evidence to be able to determine whether family therapy approaches offer any advantage over educational interventions, other types of psychological therapy, or whether one type of family therapy approach is more effective than another. Most of the studies contributing to the findings were undertaken in adolescents and young adults. There are clear implications about how family therapy approaches might be delivered to different age groups, and we need further research to understand what the resulting effects on treatment might be.
This review looked at any restriction of fluids and food in labour compared with women able to eat and drink. The review identified five studies involving 3130 women. Most studies had looked at specific foods being recommended, though one study let women choose what they wished to eat and drink. The review identified no benefits or harms of restricting foods and fluids during labour in women at low risk of needing anaesthesia. There were no studies identified on women at increased risk of needing anaesthesia. None of the studies looked at women's views of restricting fluids and foods during labour. Thus, given these findings, women should be free to eat and drink in labour, or not, as they wish.
This review of three trials (1671 participants) found that routine administration of oxytocin with the anterior shoulder compared with use of oxytocin after delivery of the placenta did not have any influence on the amount of bleeding postpartum or retained placenta. The route of administration of oxytocin in two of the three included studies was through intravenous infusion. Cord management at delivery was consistent with double clamping and immediate cutting after delivery of the baby. Application of controlled cord traction was slightly different among the included studies. In two of the studies, the placenta was delivered with controlled cord traction when signs of placental separation were present. Fundal pressure on the uterus was used in one study from the beginning to ensure continued uterine contraction. Oxytocin was the only uterotonic assessed. There were no assessments of any impact on neonatal health. More well designed studies using consistent approaches in this area of the management of the third stage of labour are required.
We wanted to find out if surfactant administration via laryngeal mask airway compared to dummy treatment (placebo), no treatment, or surfactant administration via an endotracheal tube or other less-invasive methods given to premature infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome could improve survival. We also wanted to know if it reduced the risk of developing a chronic lung condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or duration of mechanical ventilation and other outcomes, such as any harmful effects. We searched for studies that compared surfactant administration via laryngeal mask to no treatment, surfactant administration via an endotracheal tube or other less-invasive methods in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome. We compared and summarised the results of the included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and size. We identified eight studies that investigated this therapy in 510 premature infants. Surfactant administration via laryngeal mask may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation at any time when compared to surfactant administration via endotracheal tube. Furthermore, we found that surfactant administration via laryngeal mask probably reduces the need for mechanical ventilation at any time compared to no surfactant administration. Long-term outcomes were not reported. No trial compared surfactant administered by laryngeal mask airway to surfactant administered by a thin catheter. Given the encouraging results from these trials, high-quality trials of laryngeal mask airway surfactant administration in very preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome are justified. We are not confident in the evidence because it was based on relatively few cases and few studies. The evidence is up to date to 1 December 2022.
This Cochrane review aims to determine whether drain tube insertion reduces complication rates or is associated with any risks or harms. We analysed seven randomised controlled trials including 960 participants that compared drain insertion with no drainage after axillary lymphadenectomy for the treatment of breast cancer. We found that the chance of getting a seroma if a drain was inserted was less than if no drain was inserted (0.46 times less likely), and that the number of aspirations required (using a needle to drain seroma fluid in the outpatient clinic) was lower (on average, 0.79 fewer per participant). These benefits must be balanced against a longer average hospital stay of 1.47 days in the drained population, although increasingly patients can be discharged with their drain in place, to be removed at a later date. Risk of infection, volume of fluid aspirated and rates of lymphoedema (arm swelling) or haematoma (bruising) did not differ between drained and undrained participants.
The review did not find enough evidence from trials to show which surgical options are the most effective. One small trial suggested that the ileum bowel segment (small bowel) may be better compared to ileocolonic bowel segment (combination of small and large bowel) for night time incontinence. More research is needed to determine the most effective surgical methods for urinary diversion, reconstruction or replacement of the urinary bladder that has been damaged by disease.
Nineteen trials, of which two were newly included in this update, involving 3044 participants, were included in this review. Some trials had weak methods, which required a more cautious interpretation of their results. There were many different types of devices and methods used to place these devices for both treatments in the included trials.
We found that each treatment has its own specific complications. Realigning the bones and fixing the fracture (reduction and internal fixation) is a shorter operation with less blood loss. However, people having internal fixation are more likely to need another operation than those treated with joint replacement (40% versus 11%). The reason for this is mainly from a failure of the bone to heal in those cases treated with fixation. No definite differences were found between the two treatment groups in the numbers of patients who had died by various follow-up times. People who had a replacement with an artificial hip joint that was fixed in place with cement seemed to have less residual pain and better function related to using the hip than those whose fracture was fixed. There is not enough evidence to be sure whether fixation of the bone or replacement with an artificial hip is best for treating fractures of the thigh bone near the hip joint.
We found 27 studies with 4656 men comparing Serenoa repens alone or in combination with other herbal products to a placebo (participants are made to believe they received treatment when in fact they did not). Most studies included men over 50 with moderate symptoms. Ten studies were funded by pharmaceutical organizations; two studies received government funding; and the remaining studies did not specify funding sources. Based on the most trustworthy studies, Serenoa repens alone results in little to no difference in urinary tract symptoms or quality of life compared to placebo at three to six months. This treatment is also likely not associated with adverse events. Results were similar at 12 to 17 months.
Serenoa repens in combination with other herbal products may result in little to no difference in urinary tract symptoms, but there is more uncertainty about effects on quality of life and adverse events.
The findings of this review are current to 16 September 2022. The certainty of the evidence is primarily high or moderate for Serenoa repens alone, but low for Serenoa repens in combination with other agents, meaning our confidence in the results is high, moderate, or low.
The researchers identified six studies that included a total of 517 participants. Five studies (total 485 participants) compared type I IFNs to placebo (fake medicine) injections. One small (32 participants) low quality study compared types I IFNs to prednisolone (a steroid drug) enemas. This study did not measure remission and found no difference between the treatment groups in quality of life or disease activity scores. There was no difference between type I interferons and placebo treatment groups for the number of people who achieved remission or improvement of their symptoms. These results suggest that type I IFNs do not produce remission from ulcerative colitis. Common side effects included headaches, arthralgias (joint pain), myalgias (muscle pain), fatigue, back pain, nausea, injection site reactions, rigors (cold and shivering), and fevers.
At present, the results from medical trials do not support the use of type I IFNs for the production of remission in active ulcerative colitis.
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorized the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. We found four studies on a total of 440 adults from the USA and Europe. The average age of people ranged between 48 and 56 years. They received treatment for between 2 and 25 months, and were then followed for between 8 weeks and four years. Three studies compared anti-cytokine medicines (mepolizumab, belimumab and etanercept) to a placebo (fake medicine) and one study compared two different anti-cytokine medicines (rituximab versus infliximab). Three studies received at least partial funding from pharmaceutical companies.
Mepolizumab versus placebo in people with EGPA that returned after, or did not respond to, initial treatment
Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that mepolizumab probably reduces the likelihood of the disease returning within a year of treatment.
Low-certainty evidence suggests that mepolizumab:
- may make little or no difference to mortality;
- may increase the likelihood of the disease partially or fully disappearing for at least 24 weeks, and may increase the chances of this disappearance lasting for another six months at least;
- may make little or no difference to unwanted events, serious unwanted events or withdrawal from studies due to unwanted events.
The impact of mepolizumab on disease flare (worsening) is unknown, as this was not measured.
Etanercept or belimumab versus placebo in GPA and MPA
Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that etanercept probably makes little or no difference to disease flare.
Low-certainty evidence suggests that etanercept or belimumab may make little or no difference to:
- mortality;
- the disease fully disappearing for at least 24 weeks, or disappearance lasting at least another six months after that;
- the disease returning strongly;
- unwanted events or severe/serious unwanted events
Evidence of low certainty suggests that etanercept or belimumab may slightly increase chances of people withdrawing from studies due to unwanted events.
Infliximab versus rituximab, plus steroids and cytotoxic agents (substances that kill cells), in people with GPA that did not respond to other treatments
The one study we found was too small to assess the differences between treatments (very low-certainty evidence). Mepolizumab probably reduces the likelihood of the disease returning within a year of treatment, and etanercept probably makes little or no difference to disease flare. We are less certain of the other potential benefits or risks of anti-cytokine medicines because the evidence is of low or very low certainty. Further research is likely to change the findings of this review. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to August 2019.
In January 2017 we searched for clinical trials in which gabapentin was used to treat neuropathic pain in adults. We found 37 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria, randomising 5914 participants to treatment with gabapentin, placebo, or other drugs. Studies lasted 4 to 12 weeks. Most studies reported beneficial outcomes that people with neuropathic pain think are important. Results were mainly in pain after shingles and pain resulting from nerve damage in diabetes. In pain after shingles, 3 in 10 people had pain reduced by half or more with gabapentin and 2 in 10 with placebo. Pain was reduced by a third or more for 5 in 10 with gabapentin and 3 in 10 with placebo. In pain caused by diabetes, 4 in 10 people had pain reduced by half or more with gabapentin and 2 in 10 with placebo. Pain was reduced by a third or more for 5 in 10 with gabapentin and 4 in 10 with placebo. There was no reliable evidence for any other type of neuropathic pain.
Side effects were more common with gabapentin (6 in 10) than with placebo (5 in 10). Dizziness, sleepiness, water retention, and problems with walking each occurred in about 1 in 10 people who took gabapentin. Serious side effects were uncommon, and not different between gabapentin and placebo. Slightly more people taking gabapentin stopped taking it because of side effects.
Gabapentin is helpful for some people with chronic neuropathic pain. It is not possible to know beforehand who will benefit and who will not. Current knowledge suggests that a short trial is the best way of telling. The evidence was mostly of moderate quality. This means that the research provides a good indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially different is moderate.
Until 4 August 2016, we did computer searches for studies of a POC compared with another birth control method or no contraceptive. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find other trials. The focus was on change in body weight or other body measure of lean or fat mass.

With six new studies in this update, we have 22 studies that included 11,450 women. The groups compared did not differ much for weight change or other body measures in 15 studies. Five studies with moderate or low quality results showed a difference between study groups. Three studies showed differences for users of the injectable ‘depo’ versus no hormonal method. Depo users had a greater weight gain in two studies. In the third study, adolescents had a greater increase in body fat (%) and decrease in lean body mass (%). Two studies showed a greater increase in body fat (%) for users of hormonal intrauterine contraception versus women not using a hormonal method. One also showed a similar difference with a progestin-only pill. Both studies showed a greater decrease in lean body mass with POC use.

We found little evidence of weight gain when using POCs. Mean weight gain at 6 or 12 months was less than 2 kg (4.4 lb) for most studies. The groups using other birth control methods had about the same weight gain. Good counseling about typical weight gain may help women continue using birth control.
The review of 121 trials found that larger doses of misoprostol are more effective than prostaglandin and that oxytocin is used in addition less often. However, misoprostol also increases hyperstimulation of the uterus. With smaller doses, the results are similar to other methods. The trials reviewed are too small to determine whether the risk of rupture of the uterus is increased. More research is needed into the safety and best dosages of misoprostol. Another Cochrane review has shown that the oral route of administration is preferable to the vaginal route.
The review found that people who had antibiotics before or during catheter use were less likely to have an infection, and less likely to have a large number of bacteria or pus cells in the urine. However, there was no evidence concerning the chance of allergic reactions or other side effects from the antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were identified in most studies but there was no definite link made to the use of antibiotics.
We searched for all relevant, well-conducted studies to February 2021. We included nine randomised controlled studies (an experiment in which participants are randomly allocated to two or more interventions, possibly including a control intervention or no intervention, and the results are compared). The nine studies included 1892 participants who underwent pancreatic surgery. Four of the nine studies randomised 1110 participants to drain use (number of participants = 560) or no drain use (N = 550). Two studies randomised 383 participants to an active drain (drains with low or high pressure suction, N = 194) and a passive drain (drains without suction, N = 189). Three studies randomised 399 participants with a low risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula (an abnormal communication between the pancreas and other organs due to leakage of pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes from damaged pancreatic ducts) to early drain removal (N = 200) or late drain removal (N = 199). Five of the nine included studies were sponsored by non-commercial grants. Two studies did not receive any funding. The other two studies did not report funding sources. Drain use may reduce death at 90 days. Compared with no drain use, the evidence suggested that drain use may result in little to no difference in death at 30 days, wound infections, duration of hospitalization, the need for additional open procedures for postoperative complications, and quality of life. There was one drain-related complication (the drainage tube was broken) in the drainage group (0.2%). Drain use probably resulted in little to no difference in overall complications. The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of drain use on infections in the abdomen and the need for additional radiological interventions for postoperative complications.
Compared with a passive drain, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of an active drain on death at 30 days, infections in the abdomen, wound infections, overall complications, duration of hospitalization, and the need for additional open procedures for postoperative complications. There was no drain-related complication in either group.
The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of early drain removal on death at 30 days, wound infections, hospital costs, and the need for additional open or radiological procedures for postoperative complications. We found that early drain removal may reduce infections in the abdomen, overall complications, and duration of hospitalization, but the evidence was very uncertain. None of the studies reported on drain-related complications.
It is unclear whether routine drain use had any effect on death at 30 days or complications after surgery, compared with no drain use. Routine drain use may reduce death at 90 days compared with no drain use. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of an active drain on death at 30 days or postoperative complications, compared with a passive drain. Compared with late drain removal, early drain removal appears to reduce infections in the abdomen, overall complications, duration of hospitalization for people with a low risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula, but the evidence is very uncertain. All nine studies had weaknesses that potentially affected the reliability of the results. Overall, the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
This review includes 72 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to July 2013 that compared at least two groups of participants, each presented with a different size of a portion, package or item of tableware. Included studies measured the amounts of food, alcohol or tobacco selected and/or consumed by participants, typically over a period of one day or less. Almost all of the included studies investigated food, with only three tobacco studies and no alcohol studies found. Almost all assessed participants' responses to different sizes rather than different shapes. The average age of participants in the different studies ranged from three to 55 years, with more studies involving adults than children and most conducted in the USA. Sources of funding were reported for the majority of studies and there was no evidence of study funding by agencies with commercial interests in their results.  We found evidence that people consistently ate more food or drank more non-alcoholic drinks when offered larger-sized portions, packages or items of tableware than when offered smaller-sized versions. We estimate the size of this effect to be small to moderate among both children and adults. If an effect of this size were sustained across the whole diet it would be equivalent to around a 12% to 16% change in average daily energy intake from food among UK adults. We rated the overall quality of the evidence for this effect as moderate, due to concern about study limitations arising from incomplete or unclear reporting of methods and procedures. From three tobacco studies, we found no effect of longer compared with shorter cigarettes on the amounts of tobacco consumed. We rated the overall quality of evidence for this effect as low due to concerns about study limitations and not having enough evidence. One study found that adults provided with shorter, wider bottles drank larger amounts of water from them, having already poured more, compared with those provided with taller, narrower bottles. However, we rated the quality of this evidence as very low, due to very serious concerns about study limitations and not having enough evidence (only one study with outcome data from 50 participants). We further found that adults, but not children, consistently chose (selected) more food (including non-alcoholic drinks) when offered larger-sized portions, packages or items of tableware than when offered smaller-sized versions. The estimated size of this effect was again small to moderate. We rated the overall quality of the evidence for this effect as moderate, due to concern about study limitations. Evidence from three studies suggested that adults and children provided with shorter, wider bottles or glasses selected increased quantities of non-alcoholic beverages for subsequent consumption, compared with those provided with taller, narrower bottles or glasses. We rated the quality of this evidence as low, again due to concerns about study limitations and unexplained variation in effects between the three studies. Overall, this review provides the most conclusive evidence to date that acting to reduce the size, availability and appeal of larger-sized portions, packages and tableware has potential to reduce the quantities of food that people select and consume by meaningful amounts. However, it is uncertain whether reducing portions at the smaller end of the size range can be as effective in reducing food consumption as reductions at the larger end of the range. Our findings highlight the need for further research that aims to reduce uncertainties about these effects and address identified gaps in the evidence base, including not having enough evidence for longer-term effects and the absence of evidence about alcohol products.
Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, they help people cope with symptoms such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. Guidelines state that there is no difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics, but low-potency antipsychotic drugs are often seen as less effective than high-potency drugs, and they also seem to differ in side-effects. The classification into high-potency and low-potency medication means that low-potency antipsychotic drugs need higher doses for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Side-effects that are common to most high-potency antipsychotic drugs include the movement disorders such as uncontrollable movements of the face, arms, or legs; tremors; problems with balance or walking; restlessness; seizures; joint pain whereas low-potency drugs are more likely to cause sedation, fever and loss of muscle strength. Research has not evaluated and compared high-potency drugs with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. The aim of the review was therefore to compare trifluoperazine (a high-potency antipsychotic) with low-potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Examples of low-potency drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine and levomepromazine. The review is based on a search carried out in 2010 and included seven studies with a total of 422 people. It compared trifluoperazine with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. Overall, information was poorly reported and the quality of the studies was low; authors rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes of interested as being either moderate, low or very low quality. Results do not show a superiority of trifluoperazine compared with low-potency antipsychotics. However, at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness) was significantly more with trifluoperazine. For people with schizophrenia it is important to know that trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics are approximately equal for dealing with symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things. They differ slightly in their side-effects, with trifluoperazine leading to at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness). However, no clear superiority of trifluoperazine versus low-potency antipsychotics was found. Due to the limited number of studies, participants and low quality of information, these results have to be interpreted with caution.

There are no trials of the impact of tobacco advertising and promotional activities on people taking up smoking. However, there are studies following nonsmokers and their exposure to advertising (such as the number of tobacco advertisements in the magazines they read). The review found that in all these studies, nonsmoking adolescents who were more aware of or receptive to tobacco advertising were more likely to become smokers later.
The review of trials found there was some evidence that suctioning without disconnection improves stability. These improvements were small so this can not be recommended as the only way to suction the babies. More research is needed.
Our review included one published randomised controlled trial, involving 17,802 participants, which reported outcomes of VTE. This trial investigated rosuvastatin compared with placebo for the primary prevention of VTE. Analysis showed that, compared with placebo, rosuvastatin reduced the incidence of VTE and DVT, the risk of any (fatal and non-fatal) myocardial infarction, and any (fatal and non-fatal) stroke. There were no differences between rosuvastatin and placebo in the incidence of pulmonary embolism, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, and death after VTE. The incidence of any serious adverse events was not different between rosuvastatin and placebo. No firm conclusions or suggestions could be made from these findings. More randomised controlled trials of statins (including rosuvastatin) are needed to evaluate the efficacy of statins in the prevention of VTE.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence was moderate because of imprecision, as the required sample size for the outcomes of this review was not achieved.
Controlled clinical studies that evaluated the effect of systemic corticosteroids to induce remission in Crohn's disease were reviewed. For inclusion in this analysis, studies could compare any form of corticosteroid that is systemically absorbed (e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, 6-methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone) to either placebo (fake medicine) or 5-aminosalicylates (e.g. mesalazine, mesalamine or sulfasalazine). Corticosteroids were found to be more effective than either placebo or 5-aminosalicylates at inducing remission in Crohn's disease. Although corticosteroids caused side effects more often in patients compared with placebo and 5-aminosalicylates, these side effects were not serious enough to cause withdrawal from the studies reviewed. In summary, corticosteroids are effective at inducing remission in patients with Crohn's disease. While they cause frequent side effects, these side effects were relatively minor in the reviewed studies, some of which followed patients for up to 24 weeks.
We wanted to identify whether insertion of ventilation tubes was better than no treatment, or other types of treatment (such as medicines or hearing aids), for children with OME. We also wanted to see if there were any unwanted effects associated with having ventilation tubes inserted. We searched for studies that compared ventilation tubes with either no treatment or a different treatment, in children with OME. We compared and summarised the study results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 19 studies with a total of 2888 participants. We considered the majority of the evidence we found to be uncertain, because of the relatively small number of children included and some issues with the conduct of the studies. The evidence from the studies done so far does not allow us to say when, and by how much, ventilation tubes will improve hearing in any specific child.
We looked for studies that compared ventilation tubes to different types of treatment, including no treatment, delayed treatment with ventilation tubes (if needed), hearing aids, antibiotics or creating a small hole in the eardrum (called 'myringotomy'). We did not find any studies that compared ventilation tubes to hearing aids, but we did find evidence for the other comparisons.
Ventilation tubes may reduce the number of children with persistent OME after three to six months of follow-up. This benefit was not seen after longer follow-up. However, many children in the 'control group' (who were planned to receive no treatment) either recovered spontaneously or received ventilation tubes during the follow-up period. This makes it hard to assess the evidence after longer follow-up.
We did not find any evidence about quality of life, so we do not know if ventilation tubes have any impact on this.
We were not able to combine the results of different studies to calculate how often an eardrum perforation may occur. However, the studies reported this side effect in between 0% and 12% of children who received ventilation tubes. We did not have enough information to identify whether certain groups of children would benefit from ventilation tubes (for example, children with Down syndrome or cleft palate, children with severe hearing loss or those in a certain age group). In clinical practice, different types of ventilation tubes are available, which last for different lengths of time - we did not identify any studies that specifically looked at the use of long-acting ventilation tubes, where the benefits and harms may be different. Further work needs to be done to identify which children with OME would benefit from treatment, and which children are likely to recover spontaneously. The evidence is up-to-date to January 2023.
The review found that although Danazol is effective at reducing menstrual blood loss there are not enough trials to show whether this treatment is acceptable to women with heavy menstrual bleeding.
In this review of randomised controlled studies, we evaluated the effects of adding marine omega-3 fatty acids to women’s diets during pregnancy or lactation on allergic diseases in their children. We analysed eight trials that involved 3366 women and 3175 children. The women were randomly assigned to receive a marine omega-3 supplement (as fish oil capsules, or added to foods) or no treatment during pregnancy (five trials), during breast feeding (two trials) or both pregnancy and breast feeding (one trial). Overall, the methodological quality of the trials varied, with only two trials being at low risk of bias.
Overall, the results showed little effect of maternal marine omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy and/or breast feeding for the reduction of allergic disease in the children. However there were reductions in some outcomes such as food allergy during the baby's first year and eczema with marine omega-3 supplementation in women with a baby at high risk of allergy. Currently, there is not enough evidence to say that omega-3 supplements from marine origin during pregnancy and/or breast feeding for mothers will reduce allergies in their children.
In terms of safety for the mother and child, omega-3 fatty acids supplementation from marine origin during pregnancy did not show increased risk of excessive bleeding after the baby was born (postpartum haemorrhage) or early childhood infections.
The evidence is up-to-date to 20 April 2021. We included 18 studies with a total of 4993 participants who were undergoing heart surgery. From these 18 studies, two were pilot randomised control trials (RCTs) and 16 were non randomised studies (NRSs). Thirteen of these NRS studies were in adults and three were in children. The two types of prothrombin complex concentrates used were 3-factor (contains three clotting factors) and 4-factor (contains four clotting factors). These prothrombin complex concentrates were compared to standard therapy in eleven studies and rFVIIa in five studies, with the remaining two studies having no comparator.
The clotting products were given in the operating room in nine studies, intensive care and operating room in three studies and were not described in the remaining six studies. We excluded any study that used the clotting products to reverse the actions caused by blood thinning medications that the patient was already taking. Prothrombin complex concentrates compared to standard therapy
Prothrombin complex concentrates had an overall reduction in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (both units of RBC transfusion and incidence of RBC transfusion) when compared to fresh frozen plasma. There was potentially no reduction in chest drain output (bleeding) in the RCTs. There was no difference in the reported outcomes of blood clots, death, intensive care stay and the requirement of dialysis in both RCTs and NRSs. The RCTs had moderate to low quality of evidence and the NRS had very low to low quality of evidence.
Prothrombin complex concentrates compared to rFVIIa
Prothrombin complex concentrates had a large reduction in red blood cell transfusion when compared to rFVIIa. The quality of this evidence was moderate. For the remaining outcomes that we reviewed, there were only two studies that could be analysed. These studies found that there was no difference in blood clots, death, bleeding into drains, intensive care stay and the requirement for dialysis. This lack of difference could result from the lack of ability of low participant numbers to find these rarer outcomes. The quality of the evidence for these outcomes was very low. The RCTs had a low risk of bias, but the overall quality of the evidence was graded as moderate for the majority of outcomes, rather than high due to low sample numbers. For the remaining outcomes, the evidence was graded as low as there was only one RCT that contributed to those outcomes.
The quality of evidence for the NRSs was low to very low. Many of the retrospective studies had significant confounding that may have influenced the final outcome. Prothrombin complex concentrates may reduce RBC transfusion rates (both the quantity of RBC transfusion and the incidence of RBC transfusion) in patients with bleeding issues following heart surgery when compared with standard care. We didn't identify a difference in any of the other outcomes but the total number of participants in the studies was likely insufficient to detect an outcome difference.
We identified five studies, involving 197 people (aged between 17 and 82). Participants were recruited from Europe, Scandinavia, Iran, and the United States. Most of the skin lesions were recorded on the face, ear, and scalp. The duration of disease ranged from one month to 16 years. Treatments included steroid creams of different potencies (fluocinonide and betamethasone cream, both potent steroids; and hydrocortisone, a low-potency steroid); oral hydroxychloroquine; oral acitretin; tacrolimus cream; pimecrolimus cream; and salbutamol cream. The tacrolimus and salbutamol trials used placebo in the control arm. In a trial involving 78 participants, fluocinonide cream 0.05% appeared nearly three times as effective as hydrocortisone cream 1% in terms of complete clearing of the DLE (27% versus 10%). The percentage of people who had a reduction in the redness of at least 50% of their sores was not reported, nor was patient satisfaction. Skin irritation occurred in three people using hydrocortisone and one person developed acne; burning occurred in two people using fluocinonide. Adverse events did not stop any participants continuing to apply the creams.
Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg and acitretin 50 mg appear to work equally well in terms of complete resolution (50% versus 46%, respectively). Marked improvement in redness may be less in the acitretin group (42% versus 68%), but neither drug has been compared with placebo. Patient satisfaction was not measured. Adverse events, more common in the acitretin group, were reported as minor, although four people stopped treatment due to dry lips and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Pimecrolimus cream 1% (an anti-inflammatory cream) was compared with betamethasone (steroid) 0.1% cream in a small 8-week study involving 10 people, but none of the review primary outcomes were reported; nor were adverse effects.
A longer study using a similar type of cream, tacrolimus 0.1%, compared with placebo did not report the primary outcomes. Slight burning and itching was reported in five participants applying tacrolimus, and a herpes simplex infection came back in one participant. A few people reported burning or irritation after the use of tacrolimus cream, but not sufficient to cause withdrawal.
R-salbutamol 0.5% topical cream was compared with placebo cream in a trial of 37 people, but the primary outcomes of this review were not reported. There were only minor adverse events reported in each group: 15 in the placebo group and 24 in the salbutamol group. For our primary outcome of clearing or excellent improvement, we had low-quality evidence for fluocinonide 0.05% compared with hydrocortisone 1% as the only study assessing this comparison contained a high number of dropouts; while for acitretin (50 mg) compared with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg), for our primary outcomes of reduction in erythema and complete resolution we rated the quality of evidence as low, as the study contained a small number of people and differences between the groups in the number of people who had forms of lupus other than DLE. Overall, moderate-quality evidence was found for adverse events.
The authors found 23 studies; only five of these measured the effect on injury, the remaining 18 measured the effect on behaviour (by the patrons and/or the servers of the alcohol within the premises). The studies investigated a range of interventions involving server training, health promotion initiatives, a drink driving service, a policy intervention and interventions that targeted the server setting environment.
The authors concluded that there is insufficient high quality evidence that interventions in the alcohol server setting are effective in preventing injuries. The evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions on patron alcohol consumption was found to be inconclusive. There is conflicting evidence as to whether server behaviour is improved and it is difficult to predict what effect this might have on actual injury risk.
Lack of compliance with interventions seems to be a particular problem; hence mandated interventions or those with associated incentives for compliance, may be more likely to show an effect. The methodology of future evaluations needs to be improved. The focus of research should be broadened to investigate the effectiveness of interventions other than server training, where previous research dominates. When the collection of injury outcome data is not feasible, research is needed to identify the most useful proxy indicators.
We systematically analysed the published trials comparing the usefulness of FG as a small-vessel sealing agent. Eighteen randomised controlled trials on 1252 people were retrieved following bibliographic searches on standard medical databases. There were significant clinical and methodological differences among the included trials. The use of FG following breast and axillary surgery did not reduce the incidence of postoperative seroma, mean volume of seroma, wound infections, postoperative complications and the length of hospital stays. FG reduced the total volume of drained seroma and the duration of persistent seroma requiring frequent aspirations.
This review showed no overall benefit of using FG. Although this conclusion is based on the combined analysis of 18 trials, the majority of these were of poor quality due to flaws in trial methods. Therefore, this conclusion should be taken cautiously and a major, multicentre, high-quality randomised controlled trial on people undergoing breast and axillary surgery for breast cancer is required to corroborate this conclusion.
The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of haloperidol for schizophrenia and other similar serious mental illnesses compared with ‘dummy’ or no treatment (placebo). A new search for trials was carried out in May 2012 and the review now includes 25 studies with a total of 4651 people. Review authors rated the quality of evidence reported in the trials for seven main outcomes (global state, death, discharge from hospital, relapse, leaving the study early, adverse effects and satisfaction with treatment). For global state, leaving the study early and adverse effects the reviewers rated the evidence as moderate quality, however, relapse and discharge from hospital were rated to be very low quality evidence. There were no data available for death and satisfaction with treatment.
Based on moderate quality evidence, haloperidol was found to be better than placebo in treating schizophrenia. More people given haloperidol improved in the first six weeks of treatment than those given placebo. However, a significant number of people on haloperidol suffered from side effects, including muscle stiffness, uncontrollable shaking, tremors, sleepiness and restlessness.
Authors concluded that haloperidol is a potent and effective antipsychotic for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia but has the potential to cause debilitating side effects. People with schizophrenia and psychiatrists may wish to prescribe a newer antipsychotic drug with fewer side effects.
Finally, a large proportion of other information and data in the trials were poor and badly reported, meaning that better studies are required. Many people, from both groups left the trials early. This suggests that the design and running of the trials was poor and perhaps not acceptable to people. In light of these findings, it is perhaps surprising that haloperidol is a benchmark antipsychotic in widespread use for treating schizophrenia. It is also surprising that haloperidol is widely used as a comparison for new medication. Haloperidol is an effective antipsychotic drug but has serious and debilitating side effects.

To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of HA products, in knee OA, we have conducted a systematic review using Cochrane methodology. The analyses support the contention that the HA class of products is superior to placebo. There is considerable between-product, between-variable and time-dependent variability in the clinical response. The clinical effect for some products against placebo on some variables at some time points is in the moderate to large effect size range. In general, sample size restrictions preclude any definitive comment on the safety of the HA class of products, however, within the constraints of the trial designs employed, no major safety issues were detected. The analyses suggest that viscosupplements are comparable in efficacy to systemic forms of active intervention, with more local reactions but fewer systemic adverse events, and that HA products have more prolonged effects than IA corticosteroids. Overall, the aforementioned analyses support the use of the HA class of products in the treatment of knee OA.
Thirty six studies involving 2117 participants are included in this review. The studies compared people with burns who were given antibiotics with people also with burns who received either an inactive treatment (placebo), no treatment, wound dressings, or another topical preparation or antibiotic. Twenty-six trials (72%) evaluated topical antibiotics and smaller numbers evaluated antibiotics given orally, intravenously or via the airway. Most studies were small and of poor quality.
There was some evidence that a particular antibiotic (silver sulfadiazine) applied directly to the burn actually increases the rates of infection by between 8% and 80%. Otherwise there was not enough research evidence about the effects of antibiotics to enable reliable conclusions to be drawn.
We performed a literature search up to 20 September 2013. We included 15 trials with 718 participants. Trials evaluated the effect of melatonin and hypnotics on sleep after the shift and the effect of modafinil, armodafinil and caffeine plus naps on sleepiness during the shift. People who take melatonin may sleep for 24 minutes longer during the daytime after the night shift but there may be no effect on other sleep outcomes, such as time needed to fall asleep (low quality evidence). Side effects of melatonin use were rare.
For hypnotics (zopiclone), there is insufficient evidence to know whether or not they affect sleep length (very low quality evidence). We did not find reports on their side effects in shift workers. People that take modafinil and armodafinil probably have a small reduction in sleepiness and an increase in alertness during the night shift, based on evidence at three months' follow-up in people with shift work sleep disorder (moderate quality evidence). Headache and nausea were the most common side effects both in the short and long term follow-up. However, serious skin disorders have been reported since these drugs have come on the market. We found no trials in shift workers without a diagnosis of shift work sleep disorder.
We found one trial which showed that people that took caffeine before the night shift in combination with a nap before the shift had increased alertness during the night shift. The evidence was of low quality and mostly from small trials. Both sleep and alertness promoting agents have potentially serious adverse effects. Therefore, we need more trials to determine the beneficial and harmful effects of these drugs.
This review identified one randomised controlled study (involving 883 women) at 26 to 42 weeks' gestation and in early labour who were admitted to a tertiary hospital in USA (between July 1992 and January 1993). Measuring the amount of amniotic fluid when women were admitted did not improve infant outcomes but increased/doubled the caesarean section rate for fetal distress. The use of artificial oxytocin for augmentation of labour was also higher in the group of women who received the test than for those that did not. Because of the limited evidence (one study with a small sample size), we cannot make a meaningful conclusion or recommendations. More studies are needed.
The review authors searched the medical literature up to 3 March 2015, and identified 28 relevant medical trials, with a total of 2365 participants. The trials were performed in ten different countries, generally in out-patient settings. All the trials had low numbers of participants, which makes potential overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms more likely. Half of the trials were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry that produces these growth factors.
The trials tested 11 different types of growth factor, usually by applying them to the ulcer surface. Growth factors had no effect on the risk of having one toe or more amputated when compared with either another growth factor, or placebo (inactive fake medicine), or standard care alone (evidence from four trials). However, when compared with placebo or no growth factor, growth factors seemed to make complete healing of ulcers (wound closure) more likely to occur (evidence from 12 trials). None of the trials reported data on participants’ quality of life. Harms caused by treatments were poorly reported, so the safety profile of growth factors remains unclear.
It is clear that more trials are required to assess the benefits and harms of growth factors in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. These trials should be well-designed, conducted by independent researchers (not industry-sponsored), and have large numbers of participants. They should report outcomes that are of interest to patients, such as: how many of the participants’ ulcers healed, and how long the healing took; any level of amputation in the foot; quality of life; ulcer-free days following treatment; and harms caused by treatment, including whether there are any potential cancer risks.
The review authors searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials to inform the most appropriate surgical techniques to use. Twenty-seven trials involving 17,808 women from a number of different countries contributed to the review. None of these trials assessed the type of uterine incision (side to side (transverse) lower uterine segment incision versus other types of uterine incision). Results from 18 randomised trials contributed to reports that single layer closure of the uterine incision was associated with a reduction in blood loss, and duration of the procedure. In these studies the surgical procedure for entering the abdominal cavity also differed and could have contributed to blood loss and duration of surgery.
Five trials compared blunt with sharp dissection at the time of the uterine incision (2141 women) and a further two trials auto-suture devices with standard hysterotomy (300 women). Blunt surgery was associated with a reduction in mean blood loss at the time of the procedure. The use of an auto-suture instrument did not clearly reduce procedural blood loss but increased the duration of the procedure. Overall, trials focused on blood loss and duration of the operative procedure rather than clinical outcomes for the women. The methodological quality of the trials was variable.
Our search identified one trial involving 425 women and their babies. In this trial, 214 women had an induction of their labour at term, the other 211 women waited for a spontaneous onset of their labour.
The findings of this trial highlighted no clear difference between the babies of women in either group in relation to the number of large babies, baby's shoulder getting stuck during birth or babies with breathing problems, low blood sugar and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. No baby in the trial experienced birth trauma. In the group of women whose labour was induced, there were more incidences of jaundice in the babies. There was no clear difference between women in either group in relation to serious health problems for women, caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth, postpartum haemorrhage, admission to an intensive care unit and intact perineum. There were no reports in either group of maternal deaths. It should be noted that most of the evidence was found to be of very low quality.
The following outcomes were not reported: postnatal depression, maternal satisfaction, length of postnatal stay (mother), babies with high blood acid, bleeding in the baby's brain, other brain problems for the babies, babies small-for-gestational age and length of baby's postnatal stay. There is insufficient evidence to clearly identify if there are differences in health outcomes for women with gestational diabetes and their babies when elective birth is undertaken compared to waiting for labour to start spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. More research is needed to answer this question.
The review authors identified 41 eligible controlled trials in which a total of 7161 participants were randomized to laparoscopic or open surgery repair. The mean or median duration of follow up of patients ranged from 6 to 36 months. 
Return to usual activities was faster for laparoscopic repair, by about seven days, and there was less persisting pain and numbness than with open surgery. However, operation times were some 15 minutes longer (range 14 to 16 minutes) with laparoscopy and there appeared to be a higher number of serious complications of visceral (especially bladder) and vascular injuries. Using a mesh for repair reduced the risk of a recurring hernia rather than the method of placement (open or laparoscopic surgery).
This review comprises published research studies current through June 2014. A total of 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or studies comparing one treatment to another, were included in the final analysis. In total, the included studies looked at 733 participants.
In this review, review authors compared conventional laminectomy versus three other surgical techniques for low back stenosis. Here's the breakdown:
Three studies - involving a total of 173 patients - compared conventional laminectomy with one-sided laminotomy. Four studies - involving 382 patients total - compared conventional laminectomy with two-sided laminotomy (one study included three treatment groups and compared conventional laminectomy with one-sided and two-sided laminotomy). And finally, four studies - involving 218 patients total - compared conventional laminectomy with a split-spinous process laminotomy. The Cochrane review authors did not receive outside funding. This review found that each of the three newer techniques of surgery for low back stenosis delivered results no different from those of conventional laminectomy regarding self-care abilities and leg pain. Only perceived recovery of symptoms favoured patients who underwent bilateral laminotomy compared with conventional laminectomy, but the difference between unilateral laminotomy and split-spinous process laminotomy was not significant. The quality of evidence was low or very low according to Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) recommendations. This was due to the limited number of studies available for review and to poor study designs. Included studies were not designed in such a way as to yield reliable information about surgical outcomes. Before high-quality, evidence-based recommendations can be made about techniques of decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis, more rigorous studies should be done.
In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. Twenty-two randomised controlled trials (about 4000 participants) were included in the present review. Escitalopram appears to be suitable as first-line antidepressant treatment for people with moderate to severe major depression. It has been compared with only a few other antidepressants and so we are unable to say whether it is better, worse or the same as many of the other drugs used in practice. However, it did perform better than citalopram when we brought together the results of six studies in nearly two thousand patients
We were interested to know which antiseptic solution is best in:
    • preventing CRBSI/CLABSI;
• reducing the rate of infection in the blood;
• preventing the growth of germs inside the catheters.
We were also interested to know if the use of these solutions increased the risk of chemical irritation on the skin of small infants or caused other adverse effects. We searched for trials that compared:
• different types of antiseptic solutions; or
• different concentrations of the same antiseptic solution.
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found three trials: one from the USA, one from the UK, and one from Ireland. These trials involved 466 babies and were conducted in neonatal intensive care units. Two trials compared 10% PI versus 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol. The third trial compared two different preparations of chlorhexidine: an alcohol-based solution, and a water-based solution. All the trials involved premature babies born between 26 and 35 weeks of pregnancy and had a birthweight between 1000 g and 2000 g. None of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. In trials comparing 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol (CHG-IPA) and PI:
    • Compared to PI, the use of CHG-IPA may result in little to no difference in CRBSI (2 trials, 352 infants) and death (1 trial, 304 infants). It is unclear whether CHG-IPA reduces skin burns and CLABSI (2 trials, 352 infants).
    • The use of 10% PI could disturb the production of thyroid hormone (1 trial, 304 infants).
Compared to water-based chlorhexidine, alcohol-based chlorhexidine may result in little to no difference in the rate of proven CRBSI and CLABSI and probably results in little to no difference in skin irritation (1 trial, 114 infants). Compared to PI, we have little confidence that chlorhexidine is better at preventing CRBSI, CLABSI, or death, and we are not confident in the evidence that chlorhexidine is better than PI for other outcomes. The studies included were small, and the people involved in the studies were aware of the solution received by the infants, which may have influenced the outcomes. The evidence is up-to-date to 22 April 2022.
The evidence is current to August 2012. The review included 32 studies and 2762 people with LBP. Most studies included a similar population of people with LBP with and without sciatica. The majority of studies included people with acute, subacute and chronic LBP. Most studies reported follow-up of one to 16 weeks, and a limited number of studies reported long-term follow-up of six months to one year.
The included studies show that traction as a single treatment or in combination with physiotherapy is no more effective in treating LBP than sham (pretend) treatment, physiotherapy without traction or other treatment methods including exercise, laser, ultrasound and corsets. These conclusions are valid for people with and without sciatica. There was no difference regarding the type of traction (manual or mechanical).
Side effects were reported in seven of the 32 studies and included increased pain, aggravation of neurological signs and subsequent surgery. Four studies reported that there were no side effects. The remaining studies did not mention side effects.
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. There was a scarcity of high-quality studies, especially those that distinguished between people with different symptom patterns (with and without sciatica, with pain of different duration).
This review compared the effects of amisulpride with those of other so called second generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs. For half of the possible comparisons not a single relevant study could be identified. Based on very limited data there was no difference in efficacy comparing amisulpride with olanzapine and risperidone, but a certain advantage compared with ziprasidone. Amisulpride was associated with less weight gain than risperidone and olanzapine.
Three studies looking at people with chronic wounds were included in the review and found that silver-containing foam dressings did not result in faster wound healing after up to four weeks of follow-up. One study did find that the overall size of the ulcer reduced more quickly when dressed with a silver-containing foam.
There is no enough evidence to recommend the use of silver-containing dressings or topical agents for treating infected or contaminated chronic wounds.
Our team of researchers searched the medical literature for studies that compared the effects of any antimicrobial mouthwash or nasal spray used by healthcare workers against no treatment, water or a salt solution. We found no completed studies to include in this review.
We found three studies currently in progress that aim to enrol nearly 700 participants. These studies are investigating the effects of povidone iodine (as a mouthwash and nasal spray), nitric oxide (as a mouthwash and nasal spray) and GLS-1200 nasal spray (though the content of this spray is unclear, and it may not turn out to include an antimicrobial agent).
Two of the studies are randomised controlled trials (clinical, real-life studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. The third study is a non-randomised clinical study.
Only one of the ongoing studies specifically states that it will investigate adverse events. It is not clear whether this will include changes in the sense of smell or to the mix of micro-organisms that are present in the mouth or nose, and the consequences of these changes. There is currently no evidence relating to the benefits and risks of healthcare workers' use of antimicrobial mouthwashes or nasal sprays to protect themselves when they treat people with COVID-19.
Two randomised controlled trials and one non-randomised study are underway. Once these studies are completed, we will be able to analyse them and include their findings in an updated version of this review.
It is important that future studies collect and analyse information about adverse events. Only one of the ongoing studies we identified specifically states that it will investigate these. If future studies show a beneficial effect of mouthwashes and nasal sprays, it may not be a large effect (very few health interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes). It will only be possible to weigh up potentially small benefits against risks if any adverse events that occur are reported in studies. We last searched for evidence on 1 June 2020. This review covered research that was available up to that date, but did not consider any evidence that may have been produced since then.
Key results: A single study showed some benefit of the inhaled ICS-LABA combination over high-dose ICS in terms of indices of clinical stability such as dyspnoea (shortness of breath), cough-free days and number of exacerbations but failed to show significant improvement in lung function or microbiology. No data are available on children with bronchiectasis or adults with bronchiectasis during an exacerbation phase. Until further evidence becomes available, we recommend that use of combined ICS-LABA should be individualised according to the presence or likelihood of co-existing asthma features and risks of medications.
Quality of the evidence: This review is based on a single study, hence the quality of evidence is substantially limited.
Bottom line: The decision to use combined ICS-LABA in bronchiectasis must be made for individual patients on the basis of the presence or absence of bronchial hyperreactivity, until further randomised controlled trials are conducted to answer this important question.
The review authors searched the medical literature for studies that evaluated mental and motor development in infants and children randomly assigned to receive either zinc supplements or a 'placebo' (fake) supplement. We found 13 relevant studies.
Eight studies measured development using the Mental Development Index and the Psychomotor Development Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. We found no difference between the results for those who had taken zinc supplements and those who had taken a placebo. Two studies measured children's attainment of motor milestones. Again, no difference as found whether zinc supplements were taken or not. No study measured possible side effects of zinc supplementation such as vomiting, diarrhea or anemia.
Overall, the results of the studies provided no convincing evidence that zinc supplements had any beneficial effect on mental and motor development in infants and children.
The evidence is current to May 2021. We included 11 studies in this review with a total 2314 participants. 1146 participants were assigned to lamotrigine, and 1168 participants were assigned to control intervention (869 received placebo and 299 received lithium).
Our review identified the following.
Lamotrigine versus placebo
Benefits: lamotrigine was found to be superior over placebo in the following outcomes.
1) Reduced the rate of recurrence of manic symptoms
2) Suppressed depressive symptoms
3) Less need for additional therapeutic agents for the recurrence of all symptoms
4) Reduction in the withdrawal rate due to any causes six months or more after the initiating of intervention
Harms: adverse-event profile of lamotrigine was similar to that of placebo.
Lamotrigine versus lithium
Benefits: lamotrigine was as effective as lithium, except for the recurrence of manic symptoms, for which the rate was higher in people who received lamotrigine than people treated with lithium.
Harms: the rate of adverse events associated with lamotrigine was lower than that of lithium. We assessed the certainty of our included evidence to be very low to moderate. This is because majority of the included trials did not describe how treatment allocation was concealed. Given that we were unable to identify high-confidence evidence the overall findings of this systematic review should be interpreted carefully. Lamotrigine may be superior to placebo in efficacy and may be comparable in safety. And then, lamotrigine was as effective as lithium except for its recurrence rate of mania, and was superior to lithium in terms of safety. Future studies in this field with robust methods and transparent reporting are needed to confirm our results and to fully answer our pre-specified review question.
The quality of evidence for the outcomes recurrent blood clots and death was moderate. The quality of this evidence was downgraded because of the small number of events reported, leading to imprecision. For the outcome bleeding, the quality of evidence was low because of inconsistency between studies and risk of bias. Continued research into long term treatment of blood clots in the veins with LMWH and VKA is needed. This review found no clear differences in recurrent blood clots and death between LMWH and VKA, and fewer bleeding episodes with LMWH than with VKA. However, when only high-quality studies were compared for bleeding, no clear differences were observed between LMWH and VKA. LMWH may offer an alternative for some patients, for example, those in geographically inaccessible areas, those unable or reluctant to visit the thrombosis service regularly, and those for whom taking VKA may be harmful.
We searched for evidence in December 2019, and identified 26 trials involving 2007 women. The trials assessed nine different interventions, but for most of them the trials were small and had a high risk of bias; we were therefore unable to draw firm conclusions. However, the most widely-used treatment, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), for which we identified seven trials (1008 women), included two trials at low risk of bias (755 women). There is now evidence that UDCA probably reduces itching (moderate-certainty evidence). However, the size of the effect is small and for many pregnant women may not be worthwhile. The evidence for an effect of UCDA on stillbirth or fetal distress is unclear, mainly due to limitations in study design and imprecise results (very low-certainty evidence). Although UDCA has not been shown to prevent the adverse outcomes of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, there is no other effective treatment for this condition, and there is a small reduction in maternal itch.
More high-quality trials of other treatments are needed in order to identify what is effective for maternal itching and to prevent adverse outcomes. It would also be helpful to identify those women who are mostly likely to respond to UDCA (for example, whether bile acid concentrations affect how women with ICP respond to treatment with UDCA).
The evidence is current to May 2017. We found 1 study including 45 participants with MCI with a follow-up of 4 years; gender was not reported and the median age for those with a PET-positive scan by quantitative assessment was 73.5 years old. For those with a PET-negative scan the mean age was 71.8 years old. Participants were mainly recruited from local memory clinics.
Study funding sources: the study was funded by the test manufacturer. The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only one study, with not enough details on how the participants were selected. The study was considered to be at high risk of bias, since the final ADD diagnosis was not established separately from the scan results, and due to potential conflicts of interest detected. In this review, based on only one study, we found that the18F-florbetaben PET scan, as a single test with visual assessment, correctly classified 100% of the participants who will progress to ADD and 83% of the participants who did not progress to ADD at four years follow-up. This means that in a cohort with 100 participants with MCI, 47 of whom will progress to ADD, we would expect that all those 47 MCI participants would test positive with the18F-florbetaben scan and that 0 participants would be falsely negative (i.e. none of the 47 participants would have a negative test and yet progress to ADD). In addition, we would expect 44 of 53 participants who did not progress to ADD to be18F-florbetaben-negative and 9 to be falsely positive (i.e. 9 of the 53 participants would have a positive test but not progress to ADD).
The small size of the included study lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy and it is still possible that the test is considerably less accurate than these results suggest.
We conclude that 18F-florbetaben imaging is a promising test to predict the progression from MCI to ADD; however, we need more studies to clearly demonstrate its accuracy.
Five studies randomly assigned 762 women experiencing hot flushes/night sweats. Three trials and two trials, respectively, were included in pooled comparisons of exercise versus control (n = 454 women) and exercise versus yoga (n = 279 women). One small study (14 women) compared exercise versus hormone therapy. When exercise was compared with no intervention, no evidence was found of any difference in their effect on hot flushes. One small study suggested that HT is more effective than exercise. Evidence was insufficient to show whether exercise was more effective than yoga. None of the trials found any evidence of differences between groups with respect to adverse effects, but data were very scanty. The methodological quality of the studies was variable. We assessed the evidence as of low quality: The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods, inconsistent results and lack of precision.
We wanted to find out if immunosuppressive therapy improved kidney function in children with IgA nephropathy. We searched for all randomised and non-randomised studies that assessed the benefits and harms of immunosuppressive therapy in children with IgA nephropathy. We compared and summarised the trials' results and rated our confidence in the information based on factors such as trial methods and sizes. We found 13 studies enrolling 686 participants (495 children) that assessed immunosuppressive therapies in children with IgA nephropathy. Ten studies were randomised, and in three non-randomised studies, participants were allocated to treatment groups based on how serious the disease was. We found no definite evidence of the benefit of steroids alone or with other immunosuppression in preserving kidney function. However, the evidence level was very low because of the small number of studies identified and the small number of children included.
We were unable to assess the side effects of steroids because the studies did not look closely for side effects or they did not report them.
Due to the small number of studies, we could not determine the role of other immunosuppressive therapies, fish oil, vitamin E, or tonsillectomy, in reducing kidney damage in children with IgA nephropathy. The small number of studies (per comparison) and the small size of the studies were limitations in this review. Not all the studies provided data about the outcomes we were interested in. We are unsure about the results. The evidence is current to October 2023.
We searched the medical literature in order to identify studies that provided information on the above question. The authors obtained information from randomised trials only since such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well. Two review authors independently identified the trials and collected the information. The information is current to March 2013. We found four trials including 431 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy who received either formal patient education (215 participants) or standard care (216 participants). The choice of whether the patient received formal patient education or standard care was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin in order to create comparable groups of patients. The patient education included providing information by just talking to the patient but in a more formal way or by using various method of presentation. All the trials were of high risk of bias (faults in study design that can result in erroneous conclusions). Only one trial including 212 participants reported deaths after surgery. There were no deaths in either group in this trial. There was no clear evidence of an effect on pain scores at 9 to 24 hours, patient knowledge, patient satisfaction, or patient anxiety associated with education. None of the trials reported surgical complications, quality of life, percentage of patients discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy, length of hospital stay, return to work, or the number of unplanned visits to the doctor.
A total of 173 participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy underwent patient education with repeat-back (patients repeating back the information provided) (92 participants) or patient education without repeat-back (81 participants) in one trial of high risk of bias. The only outcome reported in this trial was patient knowledge. The results we found for the effect onpatient knowledge between the patient education with repeat-back and patient education without repeat-back groups were uncertain and we could not exclude possible benefits of either education or control.
Due to the very low quality of the current evidence, we are uncertain as to whether formal patient education provided in addition to the standard information provided by doctors has any benefit to patients. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary. The overall quality of the evidence was very low.
The researchers searched medical databases up to September 2014, and identified 22 studies with a total of 7436 participants that were relevant to the research question. The studies investigated the following comparisons:
- nine studies compared sterile gauze with standard polyurethane dressings;
- six studies compared standard polyurethane dressings with chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated dressings (chlorhexidine gluconate is an antibacterial disinfectant);
- one study compared standard polyurethane dressings with silver-impregnated dressings (silver compounds may have antibacterial properties);
- one study compared standard polyurethane dressings with hydrocolloid dressings;
- one study compared 'modern' gas permeable standard polyurethane dressings with 'old' (original) standard polyurethane dressings;
- one study compared highly adhesive transparent standard polyurethane dressings with chlorhexidine gluconate dressings;
- one study compared standard polyurethane dressings with sutureless (stitchless) securement devices;
- one study compared sterile gauze with no dressing; and
- one study compared chlorhexidine gluconate dressings with no dressings.
The included studies sometimes did not clearly report the methods they had used to minimise accidental or statistical error, but overall the methods were adequate.
Analysis of the study results showed that there is high quality evidence that securing a CVC with a dressing impregnated with a medication (chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated or silver) reduces catheter-related blood stream infection compared with a dressing without medication. The results indicated moderate quality evidence for a reduction in the frequency of catheter-related BSI per 1000 patient days (this is a unit used in research that represents patient use; in this case 1000 patient days is equal to 1000 patients using CVCs for one day, or 500 patients using CVCs for two days, or 250 patients using CVCs for four days, etc.) when a chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated dressing was used rather than a standard polyurethane dressing. When the risk of infection with chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated dressings was compared with the risk with standard polyurethane dressings in another way (by calculating the ratio of the risk of infection with one versus the other without taking account to patient days of use) this difference was less clear. A less direct measure of infection, that is the extent of bacterial colonisation of the tip of the catheter after removal, showed more bacteria with the standard polyurethane dressing (moderate quality evidence).
The studies that contributed to this research were mainly carried out in intensive care unit settings, where a large number of CVCs are used for short durations. Other types of dressings and securement products for CVCs that were investigated by the studies analysed here did not show any observable effects on catheter-related BSI, catheter tip colonisation or any of the other outcomes assessed, such as skin irritation, failed catheter securement, condition of the dressing and patient death.
More, high quality research is needed to investigate the relative effects of the wide range of dressing and securement products that are available for CVCs.
This plain language summary is up-to-date as of 5th June, 2015.
We included 22 studies, involving a total of 3,854 participants, that evaluated the effects of self-management interventions that include an action plan. All studies had control groups who received usual care. Follow-up was from two to 24 months. Self-management interventions including an action plan for worsening COPD symptoms improved health-related quality of life compared with usual care (high-quality evidence). The number of people who had at least one hospital admission related to lung disease was reduced among those who participated in a self-management intervention (moderate-quality evidence). There was a very small but significant increase in respiratory-related deaths for self-management interventions (very low-quality evidence).
The included studies looked at different content of self-management interventions and action plans. Study populations also differed.
Although we were unable to identify the most effective components, we found that including a smoking cessation programme seemed to be effective to further improve health-related quality of life. The evidence in this review is reliable, and the evidence for the main findings is moderate to high.
We wanted to find out if exercise-based rehabilitation was better than no exercise to improve:
- deaths
- hospital admission
- health-related quality of life We searched for studies that assessed the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in people with heart failure. We compared and summarised the results of relevant studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure. The studies were conducted in countries around the world. About 40% of the people came from 2 large studies. All studies lasted for around 6 months or longer.
Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation:
• likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions from any cause and due to heart failure up to 12 months from the start of the study;
• probably makes little to no difference in the risk of death from any cause;
• likely improves health-related quality of life as measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire.
The effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation appear to be consistent:
• whether they are delivered in a hospital or medical centre, or are home-based; 
• regardless of the amount of exercise or whether the programme also includes other components such as education or counselling; 
• regardless of the type of training (just aerobic or aerobic plus resistance training). Our confidence in the evidence is limited because not all the studies used robust methods. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of alternative models of exercise-based rehabilitation relative to traditional centre-based programmes, especially home-based and digitally supported programmes. Future studies need to consider the generalisability of trial populations (women, older people, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction remain under-represented in trial populations), the application of interventions to enhance long-term maintenance of exercise training and outcome, and costs. This review updates our previous 2018 review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.
Although there are many published studies about treatment of Gaucher disease, those that are based on randomized controlled clinical studies are considered to provide the strongest evidence. Eight such studies (300 participants) were identified by systematically reviewing the medical literature. Potential risks of bias in the methods employed in the original studies and in the data reported were assessed; only one study scored 'low' in all bias domains. Six evaluated the possible beneficial effects on the disease by enzyme replacement therapy using different products, doses or frequencies of administration; two studies examined the effects of substrate reduction therapy. Owing to different study methods and data formats, the original results could not be pooled or combined in order to obtain summary measures of efficacy. Our analysis, despite being limited by the small number of studies, suggests that, at least during the first year of treatment, different enzyme replacement therapy drugs appear to have a similar safety profile and all improve some of the most obvious manifestations of the disease.
One randomized controlled study assessing substrate reduction therapy was published immediately prior to producing the final version of this review, and this, along with a further ongoing study (expected to be published in the near future), will be assessed for eligibility in a future update of the review.
Although this research reports that  positive gains have been reported from a case-based study of a child with dysarthria following ABI (specifically with traumatic brain injury), there are currently too few studies performed in this area to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of treatment for dysarthria in children and teenagers. This review therefore calls for Speech Language Pathologists/Speech Language Therapists (SLPs/SLTs) working in this area to perform studies of the natural history and treatment efficacy of this group.
The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low, so we can draw no conclusions about whether light therapy is effective in preventing winter depression. The included study provided no information on side effects of light therapy.
Doctors need to discuss with patients considering preventive treatment the advantages and disadvantages of light therapy and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as drug treatments, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, treatment selection should be strongly based on patient preferences. The review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare light therapy versus other treatments, such as drug treatments, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression.
By combining results, immunostimulants reduced 1.24 ARTIs in a six-month period, equivalent to a 39% reduction in ARTIs compared to the placebo group. Only 20 studies provided adequate data on adverse events: the most frequent were rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. The main limitations of this review were the poor methodological quality and diverse trial results. We conclude that ARTI-susceptible children may benefit from immunostimulants, but more high-quality studies are needed. We suggest that national health authorities conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials to assess the true effects of immunostimulant preparations.
Study characteristics: We found five studies, and we asked the study authors for more information. Three studies compared milrinone versus levosimendan, one study compared milrinone versus placebo, and one compared milrinone versus dobutamine. The patients were given the study drugs for 24 to 48 hours and were watched for six to 78 days. A total of 393 participants were included.
Quality of evidence: Thus, the data are from a limited number of small trials and therefore must be viewed with caution. In addition, it was not always clear that the patient groups were formed and treated in a way that would make them completely comparable, that patients stayed in the trial for complete assessment, or that all study results were reported conscientiously.
Key results: In one study comparing two doses of milrinone and placebo, milrinone was better than placebo to prevent reduced heart function within 36 hours after surgery, but there was not enough information about long-term heart function beyond the first postoperative days. It was not shown whether milrinone was better than placebo or than any of the other medications to prevent death, or whether the intensive care unit stay or hospital stay or time on mechanical ventilation was shorter if patients received milrinone. Similarly, when examining the studies regarding side effects of milrinone, we could not prove that milrinone caused more heart rhythm disturbances than dobutamine or placebo, or how it affected heart rhythm compared with levosimendan. We could not generate other useful information from comparing the trials regarding other harms which had been previously ascribed to milrinone, such as high heart rate, low blood pressure, bleeding into the brain's ventricular fluid, low potassium level in the blood, narrowing of the airways, low numbers of platelets in the blood, altered liver function tests, or low measurements of heart function by ultrasound. This was in part due to the different trial designs.
This review encompasses three randomised controlled trials and concludes that risperidone may be beneficial for various aspects of autism including irritability, repetition and hyperactivity. However, all studies were relatively small and used different ways to assess effectiveness, making comparisons difficult. In addition, side effects were identified, notably weight gain. Further studies are therefore necessary to determine the long term benefits, if any, compared with the potential risks.
The review of trials found that cyproterone acetate appears to have a similar impact on hirsutism as other drugs used for hirsutism caused by excessive androgen. There was not enough evidence to compare adverse effects of the treatment options.
We searched the scientific literature up to March 2014 for studies of adults over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, anaplastic oligoastrocytomas or anaplastic astrocytomas. After surgery, the participants had to have received radiotherapy alone, chemotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. In the first review on this topic in 2009, we found two trials to include. In this update, we identified another trial for inclusion, and updates from the two previously included trials were taken into consideration. Three randomized controlled trials, which included 931 participants, assessed the role of chemotherapy alone or in addition to radiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone. One study was able to demonstrate a significant survival benefit for the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy after surgery, compared with radiotherapy alone. In addition, during examination of these brain tumour biopsy specimens, they found specific chromosome deletions and mutations in two studies, which helped to identify a group of participants with better survival outcomes. Furthermore, in one study, these specific chromosome deletions and mutations predicted which group of participants derived benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy after surgery. Evidence for giving radiotherapy and chemotherapy was of good quality, but sparse.
The evidence is current to July 2015. We found 12 studies, with 733 participants, which included both children and adults. Studies were conducted in specialist allergy centres in nine countries. The duration of trials ranged from four months to three years. Immunotherapy was administered to the participants in four different ways. Allergen manufacturers funded seven of the 12 studies. We found no evidence from the studies in our review that SIT may be an effective treatment for atopic eczema, as rated by participants or parents for disease severity and symptoms. We found limited evidence that SIT may improve investigator-rated disease severity. Immunotherapy did not cause any more harm than a standard treatment or placebo. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low. We downgraded quality mainly due to the differing results between studies, lack of blinding in some studies, and that relatively few studies reported outcomes relevant to patients. Future studies should use high quality allergen formulations with a proven track record in other allergic conditions and should include participant-reported outcome measures.
Our search found one trial with 46 adult volunteers with cystic fibrosis which compared nasal drops containing a steroid (betamethasone) to identical drops containing no active treatment. Two drops were applied directly to polyps twice a day for six weeks. Volunteers were put into the different treatment groups at random and a total of 22 volunteers received the steroid drops and 24 received the dummy treatment. The trial measured each person's perception of their symptom scores, but found no difference to the scores whether volunteers were using the steroid drops or the dummy treatment. The trial also measured the change in polyp size and found that they shrank. There were no major side effects linked to using betamethasone, and only three volunteers reported increased nose bleeds and discomfort.
The small number of volunteers in this trial means the calculations and results should be regarded with some caution. More trials are needed to confirm the findings and these trials should report on measures of symptoms and quality of life issues. We think that volunteers had a truly equal chance of being put in either the steroid group or the control group and wouldn't have known which treatment they were receiving, so these issues would not have influenced the results in any way. However, over 50% of people enrolled did not complete the study and the reasons for dropping out were not very clearly explained. We think it is important to take this fact into account when considering the trial results. Also, the trial only followed the volunteers for six weeks, which is a short time when evaluating a treatment that could be needed for the rest of a person's life.
We identified 15 publications (10 studies) looking at 1019 patients who were followed between three months to 10 years. We found many of the publications had poor quality of reporting and had small numbers of participants. However, there does seem to be evidence from this review that the drug sulphonylurea (like glibenclamide or glyburide, gliclazide) could make patients insulin dependent sooner and it does not control blood sugar as well as insulin. Therefore, this suggests that this drug should not be a first line treatment for patients with LADA. In addition, insulin combined with vitamin D, or Chinese herbs may maintain natural insulin production better than insulin alone. Similarly, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) may maintain natural insulin production. However, there was no conclusive evidence that any of the other remaining treatment methods were better than each other. Studies on oral agents or insulin reported no adverse events in terms of severe hypoglycaemic attacks.
This review represents very early days of our understanding of the best way to treat LADA. It is limited by the poor reporting quality of the studies, small sample sizes, no clear single definition of LADA and many of the studies being carried out in different ethnic groups (China, Japan, Cuba, UK, Sweden) with different clinical care systems. 
None of the publications reported on complications of diabetes, health-related quality of life, costs or health service utilisation. All but one of the publications reported there were no deaths. 
In summary, this review demonstrates that insulin treatment may be preferable compared to sulphonylurea treatment but there is little evidence regarding other forms of treatment. Future studies are needed, should have a clear definition of LADA, investigate patient-important outcomes and use a common method of measuring stimulated C-peptide (a marker of natural insulin production reflecting improved beta-cell function of the pancreas).
We found 14 studies up to April 2016 involving 1863 participants that looked at the benefits of these programmes for people with stroke. They were conducted in a variety of countries in a variety of formats - sometimes in groups, sometimes individually, and for varying time periods. We found that such programmes may improve the quality of life after stroke. People with stroke reported improvements in their ability to live the way they wanted and that they felt more empowered to take charge of their lives, rather than be dependent on other people for their happiness and satisfaction with life. There were no reports of any risks or negative effects. The majority of the studies were well conducted and represent credible evidence that self management programmes may benefit people with stroke who are living in the community.
The search is up-to-date to 7 August 2020. We identified 23 studies involving 6285 men. Five studies compared combination therapy with anticholinergics and alpha-blockers versus placebo (a pill with no therapeutic effects). A total of 22 studies compared combination therapy with anticholinergics and alpha-blockers versus alpha-blockers alone. Three studies compared combination therapy with anticholinergics and alpha-blockers versus anticholinergics alone. The follow-up period in the studies ranged from 12 weeks to one year. Combination therapy versus placebo: combination therapy with anticholinergics and alpha-blockers was associated with little effect in urinary symptoms and uncertain improvement on quality of life, but combination therapy may increase unwanted side effects.
Combination therapy versus alpha-blockers: combination therapy with anticholinergics and alpha-blockers may have uncertain effects on improvement of urinary symptoms and quality of life compared to alpha-blockers alone. Combination therapy may not increase unwanted side effects.
Combination therapy compared to anticholinergics: combination therapy with anticholinergics and alpha-blockers may be associated with uncertain effects on urinary symptoms, but an improvement in quality of life in comparison with anticholinergics alone. Combination therapy may not increase unwanted side effects. A majority of included studies were not well conducted or reported, which is why we rated down the certainty of evidence (the confidence to state the conclusion is right) to moderate, low or very low. This means that the true effect may be substantially different from what this review found.
For people with cancer and febrile neutropenia, there may be little or no difference in the number of deaths between those receiving pre-emptive and those receiving empirical antifungal therapy. Pre-emptive therapy may increase the rate of identifying IFD, and reduce the duration and rate of use of antifungal medicines, but has not been shown to reduce adverse events. The certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low; at best, our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. Pre-emptive therapy may be a promising treatment method for people with cancer who have FN. Since the trials reported different treatments, standardising treatment protocols will help to determine a more valid evaluation of the treatment effects.
In this review, only one study of moderate quality evidence was included. The study reported on 4155 women randomly assigned either to an intervention group (2058 women received infection screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas vaginalis and candidiasis) or a control group (2097 women received screening, but the results of the screening program were not revealed). The present systematic review found that a simple infection screening and treatment program during routine antenatal care may reduce preterm births and preterm low (below 2500 g) and very low (below 1500 g) birthweight. The simple infection screening reduced preterm births from 5% of women in the control group to 3% in the intervention group. The number of low birthweight preterm infants and very low birthweight preterm infants were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. Moreover, an infection screening and treatment program during routine antenatal care is likely to save over EUR 60,000 for each preterm birth averted.
Standard treatment options for venous leg ulcers often include compression therapy. This involves applying external pressure around the lower leg to help the return of blood from the legs to the heart. Compression therapy uses bandages, stockings or other devices.
We wanted to find out if compression therapy delivered by bandages and stockings compared with no compression:
- heals venous leg ulcers;
- has any unwanted effects;
- improves people’s quality of life;
- has health benefits that outweigh the costs (cost-effectiveness); and
- reduces pain. We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where the treatment or care people receive is chosen at random). This type of study design provides the most reliable health evidence about the effects of a treatment. We searched for studies that evaluated the effects of any types of compression bandages or stockings compared with no compression in people affected with venous leg ulcers in any care setting. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 14 studies (1391 people, average age: 70.1 years) that lasted on average for 12 weeks. People in eight of the 14 studies were treated in outpatient and community settings. People had venous leg ulcers that had lasted for 22 months on average, and most ulcers had an area between 5 and 20 cm2.
The studies used three types of compression therapy: short-stretch bandage, four-layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of compression bandage containing zinc oxide). These therapies were compared with no compression in forms of 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where only some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). Compared with no compression, the evidence suggests that:
- people wearing compression bandages or stockings probably experience complete ulcer healing more quickly; and
- more people treated using the compression bandages or stockings are likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months.
However, we did not find clear evidence to tell if using compression bandages or stockings causes any unwanted effects. The evidence suggests that, compared with not using compression, the use of compression bandages or stockings:
- probably reduces pain more than not using compression; and
- may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life in 12 weeks to 12 months.
However, we are uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings results in health benefits that outweigh their costs. Most studies were small (51 people on average) and 10 of the 14 included studies used methods that could introduce errors in their results. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to June 2020.
Current evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support the use of antidepressants. Positive results obtained by antidepressants on mood-related outcomes are consistent with the primary effect of antidepressants. They do not seem to be associated with any effect on dropouts from treatment, cocaine use or side effects, which are direct indicators of cocaine abuse and dependence. A total of 37 randomised controlled clinical studies involving 3551 participants were included in the review. All the studies except one took place in the USA; 33 trials were conducted with outpatients in the community or in mental health centres. In 10 trials patients were also treated for opioid dependence with methadone or buprenorphine. The antidepressants included desipramine, fluoxetine and bupropion and the mean duration of the trials was 10.7 weeks. The included studies utilised 43 different rating instruments and differed in design, quality, characteristics of patients, tested medication, services and the treatments delivered.
This review focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anticoagulants compared with conventional care for the prevention of catheter malfunction patients receiving haemodialysis. We found 27 studies, involving 3003 patients followed for an average six months, which assessed alternative anticoagulant locking solutions, systemic agents and low or no dose heparin. Catheter malfunction were not affected by any of these classes of agents. Subgroup analysis showed that the only agent reducing catheter malfunction was recombinant tissue plasminogen locking solution based on the results of a single study. A significant reduction was observed on the incidence of catheter-related bacteraemia for alternative anticoagulant locking solutions. There was no evidence to suggest that alternative anticoagulants to heparin locking solutions had an effect on death rates or bleeding events, although only a small proportion of studies reported bleeding events. Further high quality information is needed on both potential benefits and safety of alternative approaches to maintaining dialysis access catheter function.
The review shows that treatment with artemisinin drugs may be better than quinine at preventing death in adults and children with severe and complicated malaria. There is no evidence so far against early treatment with suppositories in rural areas whilst patients are transferred to hospital. Few side effects have been reported with these drugs.
This review searched for high-quality research studies that considered whether mobilizing community first responders could improve survival or neurological outcome, or both, following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults and children. We last searched available databases in January 2019. We found two eligible research studies with a total of 1136 participants.
One study conducted in Stockholm, Sweden, and funded by the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation, Laerdal Foundation, and Stockholm County, found that mobilizing community first responders increased the rate of CPR performed before arrival of emergency medical services (data on 665 participants). The other study was conducted in Amsterdam and surrounding areas (the Netherlands) and was funded by the Netherlands Heart Foundation and Medtronic Physio-Control. Study authors reported that when community first responders were mobilized, more patients received defibrillation before emergency medical services arrived and survived to be admitted to hospital (data on 469 participants).
Neither study found that dispatching community first responders resulted in significantly more overall survivors (data on 612 participants in one study and on 469 participants in the other). Neither study reported on the neurological function of survivors or on their health-related quality of life.
Further research is needed to establish whether mobilizing community first responders can yield more survivors of cardiac arrest. Future research should consider both survival and the neurological function of survivors. The certainty of available evidence in terms of overall patient survival was considered low. The certainty of available evidence in terms of performance of CPR and defibrillation before arrival of emergency medical services and in terms of survival to hospital admission was considered moderate. This evidence is current to January 2019.
We identified three randomised controlled trials involving 333 children up to 24 months of age hospitalised with bronchiolitis. All three studies compared nebulised rhDNase with placebo. Any additional treatments were given to both groups. Overall, the studies did not show that nebulised rhDNase shortened the duration of hospital admission, or improved the severity of symptoms. No serious side effects were reported by any of the studies.
One study showed that in patients suffering from atelectasis, a severe complication of bronchiolitis wherein the lung does not expand completely, nebulised rhDNase treatment resulted in a distinct improvement within two days. To confirm this beneficial effect, further clinical studies in patients with severe bronchiolitis are needed. Currently, the use of this treatment in young children hospitalised with bronchiolitis is not recommended.
Based on an electronic search carried out in 2012, this review now includes seven studies that randomised a total of 1113 people with serious mental illness. Six studies compared general physical health advice with standard care, one compared advice on healthy living with artistic techniques such as sketching and pottery. Information was of limited low or very low quality, there were a small number of participants and findings were ambiguous.
There is some limited evidence that the provision of physical healthcare advice can improve health-related quality of life mentally but not physically. No studies returned results that suggest that physical healthcare advice has a powerful effect on physical healthcare behaviour or risk of ill health. More work is needed in this area. Only one adverse effect outcome was presented, death, but there were no differences between the treatment groups for this outcome.
Funders and policy makers should be aware that there may be some benefit for physical health advice for people with serious mental illness. There is an increased demand for preventative health services that involve the provision of advice and which may also reduce costs to health services.

We assessed the trials with regards to potential bias and certainty. Overall, we rated the certainty of the evidence as moderate to high which means that we are fairly certain that the findings that we have reported are accurate. The trials included in this review did not examine the long-term effects of topiramate as an add-on treatment and only one study investigated the use of add-on topiramate in children. The findings should, therefore, only be applied to adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Future research should test which dose is most effective.
The evidence is current to July 2018.
From the four randomised controlled trials involving 644 pregnant women that we included in this review, results indicate that a higher dose of oxytocin (4-7 mU per minute, compared with 1-2 mU per minute) reduced the length of labour and the rate of caesarean sections with increased spontaneous vaginal births, but the studies did not provide enough evidence on possible differences between the high- and low-dose regimens on adverse events including hyperstimulation of the uterus, and outcomes for the newborn infant. Only one trial reported on the possible effect on women. The overall quality of the included trials was mixed, but this might reflect how clinical trials were reported in the past.
While the current evidence is promising and suggests that the high-dose regimens reduce the length of labour and the rate of caesarean sections, this evidence is not strong enough to recommend that high-dose regimens are used routinely for women delayed in labour. We recommend that further research is carried out.
This review includes five small studies which compare omega-3 supplements to a different supplement without omega-3. In total there were 106 participants, including both children and adults. The studies lasted between six weeks and 12 months. Due to the very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the following effects are due to supplementation or not. One 12-month study reported a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use when taking omega-3 supplementation compared to placebo and one three-month study reported no change in antibiotic use during the study period. Few side effects were reported in any of the studies. One six-week study reported that lung function and clinical status improved when taking omega-3 supplements. Sputum levels were also noted to be reduced in this six-week study. Three studies reported no difference in lung function when taking omega-3 supplementation compared to placebo. Two longer studies found that people taking omega-3 supplements showed definite increases in levels of essential fatty acids in their white blood cell membranes and also in levels of phospholipids (molecules that provide structure and protection to cells) measured in blood samples.
We are uncertain whether regular omega-3 supplements benefit people with cystic fibrosis and whether they cause side effects, or not. We are not able to draw firm conclusions or recommend the routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. Larger and longer studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit of omega-3 supplementation and to determine the appropriate dosage. We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to very low participant numbers, low event rates, limited reporting and poor study design. There was no consistency with regards to the time points when results were reported or the measurements used for the same outcome in different studies.
On 25th October 2011, the European Medicines Agency issued a press release on the worldwide withdrawal of Xigris® (human recombinant activated protein C) from the market by Eli Lilly due to lack of beneficial effect on 28-day mortality in the PROWESS-SHOCK trial. Furthermore, Eli Lily has announced the discontinuation of all ongoing clinical trials. APC should not be used for sepsis or septic shock outside randomized clinical trials.
Current evidence does not support the use of human recombinant activated protein C in adults or children with severe sepsis or septic shock; moreover, there is an increased risk of bleeding associated with its use.
This is an update of a previous review. The first version was published in 2012 and included seven studies. For this update we searched for new studies in December 2016 and found one. This review now includes eight trials. Seven of these were trials of the 'Smokefree Class Competition' (SFC), which has been widely used throughout Europe. In this competition, classes (generally between the ages of 11 and 14 years) promise to be smoke-free for a six-month period. They report regularly on their smoking status, and if 90% or more of the class are non-smokers at the end of the six months, the class goes into a competition to win prizes. In the one trial that did not test the SFC, classes with the smallest percentage of students smoking at the school year's end were given rewards. We assessed the results from seven trials of SFC and found that the competition did not have a significant impact on whether or not young people started smoking. As there was only one trial that was not of the SFC, we concluded that we do not have enough information to evaluate whether this programme was effective in preventing young people from starting to smoke. Potential negative effects of the SFC have not been widely researched, but the available data suggest that the SFC programme does not have any significant negative effects. We judged the overall quality of evidence to be low or very low, because it is based on a small number of studies, with imprecise effects and with a high or uncertain risk of bias.
We did not find any randomised controlled trials comparing Hib conjugate vaccines with placebo ('dummy' treatment) or no treatment in people with SCD. There are no randomised controlled trials of this vaccine in people with SCD. However, there has been a dramatic decrease in the occurrence of severe Hib infections in children with SCD living in high-income countries since the vaccination has been included in childhood immunisation schedules. Therefore, including universal Hib conjugate vaccination in low-income countries may improve the survival of children with SCD. There is not enough data to allow us to assess the potential effect of Hib vaccination in unvaccinated adults with SCD. Future trials should assess the ideal Hib immunisation schedule in children and adults with SCD.
The review found reliable evidence that taking vitamin D only, in the forms tested in the trials, is unlikely to prevent fractures. However, reliable evidence showed that vitamin D taken with additional calcium supplements slightly reduces the likelihood of hip fractures and other types of fracture. The review found that there was no increased risk of death from taking vitamin D and calcium.
Although the risk of harmful effects (such as gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms and kidney disease) from taking vitamin D and calcium is small, some people, particularly with kidney stones, kidney disease, high blood calcium levels, gastrointestinal disease or who are at risk of heart disease should seek medical advice before taking these supplements.
This review is up-to-date as of 5 November 2019. The review includes four studies involving 342 adults who had received radiotherapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer. The review looks at three different ways to prevent ORN:
- the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in bone after removal of healthy teeth prior to radiotherapy. Plasma is a part of blood that contains special proteins that help the blood to clot, and PRP is concentrated plasma which supports cell growth. Injecting PRP into damaged tissue may stimulate the body to grow new, healthy cells to make it heal more quickly;
- taking out teeth because of tooth decay makes the risk of developing ORN greater. Preventing tooth decay in people having radiotherapy is very important. We looked at a study comparing using fluoride gel with a toothpaste with a higher level of fluoride than normal to prevent tooth decay after radiotherapy;
- hyperbaric oxygen therapy is breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber to improve blood supply, which may help heal damaged tissue. Two studies compared the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for taking out teeth or placing dental implants with antibiotics. Antibiotics are drugs which stop or slow the growth of bacteria. One study showed no reduction in ORN when using platelet-rich plasma in bone after the removal of healthy teeth. Another study found no difference between fluoride gel and toothpaste with a higher level of fluoride than normal as no cases of ORN were reported. A third study showed that treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy caused a reduction in the development of ORN in comparison to patients treated with antibiotics following the removal of teeth. The fourth study found no difference between combined hyperbaric oxygen therapy and antibiotics compared to antibiotics alone.
Harmful effects of the different interventions were not reported clearly or were not important. The level of certainty we have in these findings is very low. This was due to high risk of bias, not all studies mentioning important details, and the small number of people studied in the four included trials. We do not have enough evidence to say which intervention works better to stop ORN of the jaws from happening or making it less severe in adults receiving head and neck radiotherapy. We suggest that more, well-conducted, and bigger studies including more people, should be done in this area.
While the drug is very acceptable to those who use it, the review of trials did not find enough evidence to show whether it is helpful. Further research is needed.
There was evidence of benefit that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were more effective than placebo, although the evidence was of very low quality. There was also evidence of benefit for monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs), and benzodiazepines, even though the evidence was low in quality. The anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin also showed moderate-quality evidence of a clinical response. We did not observe this effect for the remaining medication classes. The SSRIs were the only medication proving effective in reducing relapse based on moderate-quality evidence. There was low-quality evidence that more people taking SSRIs and SNRIs dropped out due to side effects than those taking placebo, but absolute withdrawal rates were low.
For the outcome of SAnD symptom severity, there was evidence of benefit for SSRIs, the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine, MAOIs, RIMAs, benzodiazepines, the antipsychotic olanzapine, and the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) atomoxetine, but most of the evidence was of very low quality. SSRIs and RIMAs reduced depression symptoms, and SSRIs reduced functional disability across all domains.
We also observed response to long-term treatment with SSRIs (based on low-quality evidence), MAOIs (based on very low-quality evidence), and RIMAs (based on moderate-quality evidence). Most evidence for treatment efficacy is related to SSRIs. Nevertheless, SSRI trials were associated with very low-quality evidence and high risk of publication bias. It would be useful for future studies to evaluate the treatment of SAnD in people with comorbid disorders, including substance use disorders. Trials that provide adequate information on randomisation and allocation concealment are needed.
The evidence is current to May 2015. We found 12 relevant studies (with 2351 participants) comparing colloids with crystalloids. Eleven of these studies included people with ischaemic stroke (stroke sustained due to a clot), whilst one study included people with haemorrhagic stroke (stroke due to a bleed). Five of these studies (1420 participants) also made a comparison between 0.9% saline, the most commonly prescribed iv fluid, and another fluid type. The largest study had 841 participants, whilst the smallest had 27 participants. The length of time that fluids were given varied between trials, from two hours to 10 days.
Ten studies revealed a source of funding. Of these, two studies were funded by fluid manufacturers. We did not find any studies that examined the best fluid volume, mode of fluid delivery, or duration of fluid treatment.
We found that people with acute stroke given crystalloids (including 0.9% saline) had about the same risk of death or dependence as people given other fluid types. People given crystalloids also had a lower risk of pulmonary oedema, a complication that can lead to breathlessness due to excess collection of watery fluid in the lungs. From the evidence we obtained, it was difficult to make any concrete conclusions about which fluids were better for reducing brain swelling (cerebral oedema) or a serious lung infection (pneumonia).
We found no evidence to guide the best volume, duration, or mode of parenteral fluid delivery for people with acute stroke. The majority of studies had a low to moderate risk of bias based on study limitations and inconsistency. Most studies reported the outcomes they stated they would.
First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies in which people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence-based on factors such as study methods and sizes and the consistency of findings across studies. We found one study that involved a total of 19 people with glaucoma. The study was set in Canada and funded by the University of Alberta. People were followed for up to one year after surgery. All participants were operated on by the same surgeon. Trabectome surgery was compared against a standard surgical procedure (trabeculectomy).
Based on the single study we found, we cannot determine whether Trabectome surgery is better or worse than conventional surgery. The study was very small, and there were problems with the way it was conducted. Therefore, we have too little confidence in its results about the following:
- the need to use any, or fewer, eye drops one year after surgery;
- improvement in eye pressure one year after surgery;
- the need for more surgery; and
- complications.
Other aspects, such as changes in vision or quality of life, were not studied.
We identified one ongoing study that is being conducted in Japan. Once results are available for this study, it will be possible to add them to future versions of this review. We do not know whether Trabectome surgery is better or worse than other treatments for glaucoma. This is because there is too little evidence at present. It would be helpful if more studies were conducted in this area in future. In particular, there is a need for robust studies that assess the long-term benefits and risks of Trabectome surgery. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to July 2020.
We included eight randomized controlled trials in the review, and we based our analysis on seven of these: two cross-over trials that included 125 participants, and five parallel trials involving 492 participants. The mean age of participants varied from 71.5 years to 83.5 years. Oral sedation was used for two trials only. No trial used oral analgesics before the operation, and no trials mentioned their source of funding. This review showed that sub-Tenon’s anaesthesia provided slightly better pain relief than topical anaesthesia during cataract surgery. The difference was equal to 1.1 on a scale from 0 to 10. Pain on the day after surgery was slightly lower for participants who received topical anaesthesia, and the difference was equivalent to 0.2 on a scale from 0 to 10. Both surgeons and participants preferred sub-Tenon’s anaesthesia. However, all trials were performed at a time when surgeons were only starting to use topical anaesthesia. There was not enough evidence from included trials to say whether one anaesthetic technique would be associated with a lower or higher incidence of important surgical complications during surgery (posterior capsular tear, iris prolapse) that may lead to postoperative complications and eventually to poorer vision. Topical anaesthesia and sub-Tenon’s anaesthesia therefore are accepted and safe methods of providing anaesthesia for cataract surgery.
The review authors searched the literature and identified two controlled trials from the USA that involved 187 heroin addicts, aged 14 to 21 years; the participants were treated as outpatients. One study of 37 participants compared methadone with levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) for maintenance treatment. After 16 weeks of maintenance treatment the adolescents were detoxified. The second trial of 150 adolescents compared buprenorphine and naloxone as maintenance treatment for nine weeks followed by tapered doses for up to 12 weeks with buprenorphine detoxification over 14 days. In the first trial methadone and LAAM led to similar improvements in social functioning. No side effects were reported.
In the second trial the maintenance treatment seemed to be more effective in retaining patients in treatment but not in reducing the use of drugs of abuse. At one-year follow-up, self reported opioid use was clearly less in the maintenance group and more adolescents were enrolled in other addiction programmes. The most common side effect in both groups was headache. No participants left the study because of side effects.
It is difficult to draw conclusions about the use of maintenance pharmacological interventions from only two trials. Conducting trials with young people may be difficult for both practical and ethical reasons. This review was limited by the very low number of trials retrieved. The quality of the evidence was very low for the comparison between methadone and LAAM and low for the comparison between buprenorphine detoxification and buprenorphine maintenance. The evidence is current to January 2014.
We identified two trials (of high risk of bias or systematic error) involving 152 patients randomised to gastrojejunostomy (80) and no gastrojejunostomy (72). In both studies, patients were found to be unresectable during operations aimed at surgical removal i.e. the stomach was opened to remove the cancer but the cancer could not be removed. There was no evidence of any difference in the overall survival, surgical complications, quality of life, or hospital stay between the two groups. The proportion of patients who developed long-term stomach outflow obstruction was significantly lower in the prophylactic gastrojejunostomy group (2.5%) compared with no gastrojejunostomy group (27.8%). The operating time was significantly longer in the gastrojejunostomy group compared with no gastrojejunostomy group by about 45 minutes. Routine prophylactic gastrojejunostomy is indicated in patients with unresectable periampullary cancer undergoing open operation of the stomach. There is no information available currently about the necessity for prophylactic gastrojejunostomy in patients with periampullary cancer diagnosed to be unresectable by investigations such as scans. Further trials of low risk of bias are necessary to assess the role of prophylactic gastrojejunostomy in patients with unresectable periampullary cancer.
In this systematic review of the literature we did not find any controlled studies assessing the effects of interventions to increase participation in sport.
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10 µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti-diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon-like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon-like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon-like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti-diabetic treatments. The incidence of hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. The studies were not long enough to assess long-term side effects. None of the studies investigated mortality or morbidity.
We looked for randomised controlled trials in people with recent onset of stroke symptoms that compared LMWH or heparinoids with UFH. We found nine trials involving 3137 participants; overall these trials had a moderate risk of bias (this means that the results are likely to be less credible than if the risk of bias was low). No new trials were included in this updated review. None of the studies reported reliable information on disability or recovery after stroke. Compared with UFH, there was no evidence of an effect of LMWH or heparinoids on death from all causes during the treatment period (quality of the evidence was low). Although LMWH or heparinoid were associated with significantly fewer clots in leg veins (DVT) than UFH, the number of major events such as when a blood clot becomes lodged in an artery in the lung (pulmonary embolism) and bleeding inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhages) was too small to know whether the harms outweighed the benefits. For people with ischaemic stroke who need immediate treatment with anticoagulants, evidence from the included clinical trials did not provide reliable evidence on the balance of risk and benefit for each type of heparin. Additional large scale research would be needed to resolve this uncertainty. Overall, there was a moderate risk of bias in the included studies. Using GRADE criteria we found that evidence quality was low overall.
COPD trials lasting longer than six months often have large numbers of people leaving the trial early. In INSPIRE, the largest trial in our review, comparing fluticasone/salmeterol to tiotropium, there were seven to 11 times more people leaving the trial early than the number who died; a number that swamps the death rate. Therefore we felt unable to draw a reliable conclusion as to which treatment has the lowest mortality rate. This uncertainty also left us unable to reliably say which drug was better in terms of reducing COPD exacerbations, hospitalisations and serious adverse events or improving quality of life and health status.
More information about COPD and explanations of terms used in this summary can be found here.
We searched the scientific literature for studies of anticoagulants in people with cancer. The evidence is current to 14 August 2017. We included 19 eligible trials. We selected 19 trials including 9650 participants with cancer. Most trials included participants with various types of cancer, especially small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. All studies were conducted in the outpatient setting. The results suggest that the effect of injectable blood thinners on survival is uncertain, but if anything of small size. Also the results suggest that injectable blood thinners reduce the risk of blood clots by about half and possibly increase the risk of major bleeding and minor bleeding by 4 more per 1000 and 17 more per 1000, respectively. The effect on quality of life is uncertain. We judged the certainty of evidence to be high for symptomatic VTE and minor bleeding, and moderate for mortality, major bleeding and quality of life.
Editorial note: This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence, as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.
In this review we set out to examine the evidence on how well NSAIDs worked (alone or with morphine-like drugs) in adults with cancer pain. We also wanted to know how many people had side effects, and how severe they were.
In April 2017, we found 11 studies with 949 participants. They compared NSAID with NSAID, or NSAID with opioid drug (morphine or codeine). No studies looked at using NSAID together with an opioid-like morphine, which is how they are often used. The studies were small and of poor quality. They used different designs and different ways of showing their pain results. Outcomes important to people with cancer pain were often not reported. Many different NSAIDs were tested, and it was not possible to make sensible comparisons. With an NSAID, initially moderate or severe cancer pain was reduced to no worse than mild pain after one or two weeks in 1 in 4 (26%) to 1 in 2 (51%) people in four studies.
Side-effect reporting was poor. Two serious side effects were reported with NSAIDs, and 22 deaths, but these were not related to pain treatment. Common side effects were thirst/dry mouth (1 in 7; 15%), loss of appetite (1 in 7; 14%), sleepiness (1 in 10; 11%), and heartburn (1 in 10; 11%). One in four people stopped taking NSAIDs because the drug did not work, and 1 in 20 stopped because of side effects. The quality of the evidence was very low. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the impact of an NSAID alone for treating cancer pain. We do not know whether using NSAIDs together with an opioid such as codeine or morphine is worthwhile.
This review found six studies, involving 1902 participants, comparing the long-term efficacy and side effects of tiotropium combined with combination inhalers for treatment of patients with COPD. Not all of the people included in these studies had COPD that was severe enough to be recommended for combined therapy according to current guidelines. Current evidence shows potential benefits of treatment with tiotropium in addition to inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist combination therapy through increased health-related quality of life and a small improvement i n lung function in patients receiving this combined therapy. However, this evidence does not allow us to draw conclusions about the effects of these treatments on mortality, hospitalisation for all causes and exacerbations. The frequency of serious and non-serious adverse events was not increased in either of the two groups. Overall, we assessed the evidence presented in this review to be of moderate or low quality, which means we are reasonably confident in some of the findings, but less confident in others.
We searched the available literature for trials in which people were invited either to collect specimens at home or to attend a clinic for collection of specimens. We found 10 relevant trials in total. Three trials (including 1566 people) provided data to assess the proportion of people who completed testing, diagnosis and treatment. All trials gave information about the percentages of people who took self-collected specimens for detection of chlamydia and gonorrhoea infections at home and those who took the test at a clinic. Nine studies reported percentages related to positive test results. Trials in this review were funded by governmental or non-governmental organisations. There was no evidence of a difference between home-based and clinic-based specimen collection in the proportion of people who completed testing, diagnosis and treatment. In the home-based group 45 infections were detected and treated in a total of 778 people invited to collect specimens at home. In the clinic-based group 51 infections were detected and treated in a total of 788 people invited to attend a clinic. We could not combine data from individual studies looking at the number of participants tested because the proportions varied widely. A lower number of participants diagnosed in the home-based compared with the clinic-based group was documented. The potential harms of testing with home-collected specimens were not evaluated in any trial. The GRADE quality for the main outcomes was moderate (index case management, positive test prevalence) or low (proportion of individuals tested). The quality of evidence was downgraded because of methodological limitations in the studies. Home-based specimen collection could result in similar levels of index case management forChlamydia trachomatisorNeisseria gonorrhoeaeinfection when compared with clinic-based specimen collection. The safety of home-based specimen collection compared with clinic-based specimen collection have not been evaluated.
In this review, we found only one study that focused on the effects of healthcare professionals using email to communicate with each other. This study included 327 patients and 159 healthcare providers, and compared an email reminder for physicians with usual care. It found that healthcare professionals who received an email reminder were more likely to provide guideline-recommended osteoporosis treatment than those who did not, and this may or may not have improved patient care. We were unable to properly assess its impact on patient behaviours or actions as the results were mixed. The study did not measure how email affects health services, or whether email can cause harms. This evidence is current to August 2013.
As there is a lack of evidence for the effects of healthcare professionals using email to communicate with each other, high-quality research is needed to evaluate the use of email for this purpose. Future research should look at the costs of using email and take into account ongoing changes in technology.
We searched medical journals for reports of clinical trials which examined the effects of removing white blood cells from donated blood. We were interested in finding out whether the removal of white blood cells from donated blood resulted in patients receiving a blood transfusion having few complications such as transfusion-related acute lung injury, death, infectious and non-infectious complications, or any other adverse event. We included people of any age or sex, who received a blood transfusion for any reason. The evidence is based on studies retrieved up to 05 December 2014. We found 13 studies which included people who received a blood transfusion during heart or cancer surgery, or because they were injured, had cancer, HIV or sepsis.
We found no clear evidence showing either benefits or harms for removing white blood cells from donated blood. For all of the outcomes examined (transfusion-related acute lung injury, death from any cause, infection from any cause, non-infectious complication or any other adverse event), there was no sign of benefit or harm. The overall quality of evidence of the included studies ranges from very low to low. None of the studies included enough people to give a definitive answer about the usefulness of removing white blood cells from donated blood. New high-quality studies, involving a few thousand people, are needed to enable us to know the true benefits and harms of this procedure.
This review found 69 studies that evaluated educational outreach visits. Educational outreach visits appear to improve the care delivered to patients. When trying to change how health care professionals prescribe medications, outreach visits consistently provide small changes in prescribing, which might be potentially important when hundreds of patients are affected. For other types of professional practice, such as providing screening tests, outreach visits provide small to moderate changes in practice. But the effects really varied and why it varied could not be explained.
We carried out a systematic review and searched for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared open and laparoscopically assisted vaginal methods of performing radical hysterectomy in women with early cervical cancer. The evidence is current to July 2013.
We found only one relevant trial. It included only 13 women; seven had a laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy (LARVH) and six had radical abdominal hysterectomy (RAH). Women who underwent LARVH appeared to have less blood loss, shorter hospital stay and less requirement for pain medication compared with those who underwent RAH. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of complications related to the operation in women who underwent LARVH and RAH. However, RAH had a significantly shorter operation time compared with LARVH.
The trial did not assess overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS; the time that a woman lives with the cancer but does not get worse) or quality of life (QoL) as the main focus of the trial was to examine short-term complications. Due to the small number of cases and the short-term scope of the trial, we were unable to reach any definite conclusions about the relative benefits and harms of the two forms of treatment and we were unable to identify subgroups of women who are likely to benefit from one treatment or the other.
We wanted to find out if psychological interventions for depression and anxiety reduce depression and anxiety in people with coronary heart disease, heart failure or atrial fibrillation compared with people receiving no psychological intervention.
We also wanted to find out if psychological interventions for depression and anxiety improve any other related factors, such as mental (mood; thinking) and physical (body; fitness) health-related quality of life, deaths and major adverse heart events (e.g. heart-related hospital admissions; heart-related deaths). We searched databases for studies of psychological interventions for people aged over 18 years with heart disease.
We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 21 eligible studies involving 2591 people. Of these 21 studies, 16 included people with coronary heart disease, five with heart failure and none with atrial fibrillation. We found wide variation in the kinds of interventions included in the review, in terms of what the interventions included, how and by whom they were delivered, and the clarity with which they were reported.
Compared to no psychological intervention, we found that psychological interventions for depression and anxiety probably reduce depression and anxiety, and may improve mental health-related quality of life in adults who have a diagnosis of coronary heart disease or heart failure, but not physical health. Further, they probably do not reduce mortality and do not reduce the risk of major cardiac events. There was much variation in the types of psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness, a mix of therapies), patients (different types of coronary heart disease and heart failure) and tools used to measure outcomes (a range of tools to measure the same outcome, e.g. anxiety). This made it difficult to compare the effects of psychological interventions across studies.
Also, there was some indication of inconsistent findings, not all findings were reported (only a selection) and a lack of blinding (participants knowing which group they were in) in the included studies. Further, some studies had very small sample sizes, or there were not enough studies to draw conclusions about the impact of psychological interventions (i.e. costs, deaths and major adverse heart events). Taken together, our confidence in the overall effects of psychological interventions was reduced across the main outcomes. The evidence is up-to-date as of July 2022.
We looked at whether increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids when asthma symptoms worsen reduces the need for further treatment, and if there are any harms with doing so. We looked for all studies that randomly allocated people with asthma taking a daily inhaled corticosteroid to take a blinded inhaler if their symptoms worsened. The blinded inhaler either increased their usual dose of inhaled corticosteroid or kept it the same. We were interested in whether fewer people allocated to receive an increased dose went on to have an asthma attack. We measured asthma attacks in two ways: those needing a course of oral steroids, and those needing urgent care in the emergency department or in hospital. We also looked at whether the increased inhaled corticosteroids doses led to more adverse events compared with a stable dose.
We conducted broad searches, and two researchers independently evaluated studies to judge if they should be included. We recorded information about the studies, participants, and treatment strategies. We used the latest methods for bringing the results together and assessing how much each study result could be trusted. We rated each combined result as high, moderate, low, or very low quality, depending on how confident we were that it was reliable. We included nine randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of people with mild to moderate asthma. Five studies looked at adults, and four looked at children.
People who were given the inhaler with an increased dose of inhaled corticosteroid were about as likely to get worse and need a course of oral corticosteroids as those who were given an inhaler with a placebo (dummy treatment) or their usual dose. We have moderate confidence in this main result, but it was much more difficult to tell whether there was a benefit of a dose increase for other types of unscheduled care (seeing a doctor or going to hospital) or for reducing the duration of the attack. The results for adverse events suggest that it may be safer to keep inhaled corticosteroids stable, but we had very low confidence in the results. Studies varied in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids people were taking at the start of the study, how much the dose was increased in the treatment group, when and how people were told to start the inhaler, and what other medicines they were allowed to take. Only about half the participants actually needed to take the study inhaler, and when we looked just at those people, it appeared that there might be a small benefit, but we had very low confidence because the study results varied and there was a high risk of bias.
Whilst not many people needed to go to hospital or visit the emergency department during the course of the studies, this made it difficult to tell if a short-term increase in inhaled corticosteroids is worthwhile, and our confidence in the evidence was low or very low. Studies did not report harms consistently, and the combined results were very uncertain. The review is current to 20 December 2021, and the studies were published between 1998 and 2018.
We found 25 studies, including two new ones that had been published since the last search was done in 2015. Overall, almost 2000 people received either macrolides or placebo. There were many problems in the way studies were described and how well they reported data, which made us consider the overall evidence to be low quality, undermining our confidence in most of the results. The studies were quite different from each other, for example in the severity of people's asthma, the type of macrolide they were given and the length of the treatment period.
Our review showed that macrolides were better than placebo in reducing exacerbations and may have benefits for some people in improving asthma symptoms, asthma control, asthma quality of life and some measures of lung function, but how much benefit and for whom are uncertain. Based on one well conducted study, the macrolide azithromycin may have some benefit for people with severe asthma, but overall the findings of this review do not support the use of macrolides for all asthma of any grade or severity. There were no reports of serious side effects of macrolides, but 16 studies did not report whether any occurred.
We wanted to know if in vitro maturation is beneficial or harmful compared to in vitro fertilisation techniques in women with reduced fertility and polycystic ovarian syndrome. We searched for studies investigating in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilisation techniques in women with reduced fertility and polycystic ovarian syndrome. We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study method and size. We were interested in live births (delivery of a live baby after 20 weeks of pregnancy), miscarriage (loss of pregnancy during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy), clinical pregnancy (a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound scan at seven weeks of pregnancy), ovarian hyperstimulation, premature births, and the baby's development while in the womb. We found four studies. Two provided insufficient data, but the other two published their results in full. These two studies involved 810 women. Live birth rate was similar between in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilisation, but our confidence in the evidence is very low (2 studies, 739 women). If 45 women out of 100 have a live birth following in vitro fertilisation, the chance with in vitro maturation would be between 13 and 53 women out of 100.
In vitro maturation increases miscarriage compared to in vitro fertilisation (2 studies, 378 women). If 20 women out of 100 have a miscarriage following in vitro fertilisation, the chance with in vitro maturation would be between 20 and 40 women out of 100.
In vitro maturation results in a large reduction in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (2 studies, 739 women). If 4 women out of 100 have ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with in vitro fertilisation, the chance with in vitro maturation would be between 0 and 2 women out of 100.
There may be little to no difference in clinical pregnancy, but our confidence in the evidence is very low (2 studies, 739 women). In vitro maturation probably results in little to no difference in premature birth (2 studies, 739 women) and our confidence in the evidence is very low about the baby's health, development, or genetics while in the womb (1 study, 351 women). There is still uncertainty about the effect of in vitro maturation on live births and clinical pregnancies compared to in vitro fertilisation because the study methods differed and did not include enough women to provide meaningful results. We are confident that in vitro maturation increases the chance of miscarriage, and reduces the possibility of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
We are moderately confident in the evidence for premature birth due to the small number of women enrolled and have little confidence in the evidence for the baby's health, development, or genetics while in the womb due to the small number of women enrolled in only one study. These findings should be interpreted with caution. We reviewed the evidence up to February 2023. This is the third update of this review.
We searched for studies comparing women who got emergency contraception in advance to women who got it in standard ways. We examined whether these groups had different rates of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. We also studied how often and how quickly both groups used emergency contraception. Finally, we looked at whether advance provision of emergency contraception changed sexual behavior. Studies showed that the chance of pregnancy was similar regardless of whether or not women have emergency contraception on hand before unprotected sex. Women who had emergency contraception in advance were more likely to report use of the medication, and to use it sooner after sex. Having emergency contraception on hand did not change use of other kinds of contraception or change sexual behavior.
We searched scientific databases for clinical studies comparing platelet count, spleen length, or platelet count-to-spleen length ratio versus oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy in detecting the presence of varices in children or adults with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis (narrowing of the portal vein). The evidence is current to June 2016. We found 25 studies with 5096 participants assessing the use of platelet count to diagnose the presence of varices and grade the risk of bleeding, and comparing platelet count versus oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy in adults with cirrhosis: 13 studies with 1489 participants assessed the diagnostic ability of spleen length, and 38 studies with 5235 participants assessed the diagnostic ability of platelet count-to-spleen length ratio. Platelet count-to-spleen length ratio was the most accurate and could be used to identify people with liver disease who were at high risk of having oesophageal varices. Particularly, in people with hepatic cirrhosis among whom 580 out of 1000 people are expected to have oesophageal varices, only 41 (7% of 580) people will be missed as having varices and will have no appropriate preventive treatment or follow-up. Thus, if platelet count-to-spleen length ratio is lower than 909 (n/mm3)/mm (the most used threshold), the presence of oesophageal varices can be excluded. Thus, it is possible to reduce the number of endoscopic examinations needed to find a person with oesophageal varices. On the contrary, this ratio is not accurate enough to replace endoscopy for identification of high risk of bleeding oesophageal varices. All but one study had problems of risk of bias involving mainly the definition of positive or negative index tests (platelet count, spleen length, and their ratio), which should be defined before and not after data analyses, and blinding of test results to the endoscopists who performed oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. Hence, these problems could impair the accuracy estimates of the three tests.
We wanted to find out if older people who used video calls felt less lonely than those who did not. We also looked at whether video calls affected symptoms of depression or quality of life. We looked for studies that randomly allocated older people to different groups to use either video calls, another method of keeping in touch, or no particular method (usual care), with the aim of examining their effects on loneliness or social isolation. For our review, we considered older people to be aged 65 years or above. We considered video calls to be calls made via the internet, using computers, tablets or smartphones.
COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, so we needed to answer this question quickly. This meant that we shortened some steps of the normal Cochrane Review process. Two review authors checked 25% of our search results for studies and one review author checked the remaining 75% of our results, where normally two review authors would check all the results. Similarly, only one review author collected data and assessed the quality of the studies, and a second review author checked this work. We included three studies, with 201 participants, in our review. All three studies took place in nursing homes in Taiwan between 2010 and 2020 and compared video calls to usual care.
The evidence from these three studies suggests that video calls have little to no effect on loneliness after three, six or 12 months. There is also little to no difference in symptoms of depression after three or six months, although after a year, older people who used video calls may have had a small reduction in depression compared to those who received usual care. Similarly, video calls may make little to no difference to older people’s quality of life. Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence was limited because we found few studies with a small number of participants, and they either used unreliable methods or did not fully describe their methods. Also, all of the participants were in nursing homes, so our findings may not apply to older people living in other places, such as their own homes. Also, some of the participants may not have been feeling lonely or socially isolated. Based on the current evidence, we are unable to say whether video calls help to reduce loneliness in older people. We need more studies, that use rigorous methods to investigate this question, and focus on older people who are lonely or socially isolated. This review includes evidence published up to 7 April 2020.
We reviewed a total of 5 trials which included 742 patients. We found that after two years of treatment, the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and forearm of patients taking calcium and vitamin D therapy improved more than patients who had no treatment. There was no difference in the number of fractures or laboratory measures of bone density between the two groups. We found that calcium and vitamin D is effective at preventing and treating corticosteroid-induced bone loss at the lumbar spine and forearm. The treatment appears to be safe.
We included trials comparing the efficacy and safety of whole-cell and acellular pertussis vaccines in children up to six years old. This updated review included six trials with 46,283 participants evaluating the efficacy and 52 trials with 136,541 participants assessing the safety of pertussis vaccines. Duration varied from 12 months to 27 months and from 3 days to 12 months for efficacy trials and safety trials, respectively. The efficacy of acellular vaccines with three or more components varied from 84% to 85% in preventing typical whooping cough (characterised by 21 or more consecutive days of severe coughing attacks with laboratory evidence ofB. pertussisinfection or contact with a household member who has culture-confirmed pertussis) and from 71% to 78% in preventing mild pertussis disease (characterised by seven or more consecutive days of cough with laboratory evidence ofB. pertussisinfection). In contrast, the efficacy vaccines with one and two components varied from 59% to 78% in protecting against typical whooping cough and from 41% to 58% against mild pertussis disease. Most systemic and local side effects were significantly less common with acellular vaccines than with whole-cell vaccines for the first doses and booster dose. We found that acellular pertussis vaccines with three or more components are more effective than low-efficacy whole-cell vaccines, but may be less effective than the highest-efficacy whole-cell vaccines. Acellular vaccines have fewer side effects than whole-cell vaccines. The implications of the findings of this review for clinical practice may be different in high-income and low-income countries. In high-income countries, death from whooping cough is rare and parental acceptance is a major determinant of immunisation uptake. In these circumstances, the improved side effect profile of acellular vaccines argues in favour of their use, even though they might sacrifice some degree of effectiveness compared to the best whole-cell vaccines. In low-income countries, where the risk of pertussis is higher and cases are more likely to be fatal, greater weight needs to be given to vaccine efficacy. If an acellular vaccine has been shown to be less effective than a high-efficacy whole-cell vaccine it is intended to replace, the safety advantage of the acellular vaccine may be offset by increased mortality and morbidity due to a significantly higher rate of pertussis. However, most of the whole-cell vaccines used in low-income countries have not been adequately studied for efficacy and, therefore, it is not known where on the wide spectrum of whole-cell vaccine efficacy an individual product lies. All included trials were randomised and double-blind, that is, the participants had an equal chance of receiving either acellular or whole-cell vaccines and both researchers and participants were unaware of the treatment assignment. However, most of trials did not report details of these methodological techniques. This may cast some uncertainty on the quality of evidence in this review.
We wanted to find out whether psychological therapies were beneficial for managing depression in LTC settings. Depression is common amongst older people living in LTC. This population is often prescribed medication to manage depression. Psychological therapies may be a viable alternative. Psychological therapies to treat depression in people living in LTC include behavioural therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, and reminiscence therapy. We searched for studies that compared psychological therapies for older adults with depression living in LTC facilities with an alternative care approach. We examined outcomes following the completion of therapy, and at short-term (up to three months), medium-term (three to six months), and long-term (more than six months) follow-up.
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 19 studies with 873 participants with depression. Most studies compared cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural therapy, or reminiscence therapy to usual care services or to a condition providing residents with a similar level of attention (for example, friendly visits from volunteers or current events discussion groups).
We found that psychological therapies may be better at reducing symptoms of depression than other approaches immediately following therapy and for up to six months. This effect was not as apparent in studies where psychological therapies were compared with a condition where older people were given increased attention in LTC.
Psychological therapies may also improve older peoples' quality of life and psychological well-being for up to three months after therapy, but we did not find evidence that psychological therapies reduce symptoms of anxiety in older people with depression. Our confidence in the evidence is very limited because most studies included small numbers of participants and used unreliable methods.
Given the ageing population and projected increase in older people requiring LTC, high-quality clinical trials on the effectiveness of treatments for depression are urgently required. The literature search was completed in October 2021.
This Cochrane review included all studies of psychotherapy for non-cardiac chest pain. Seventeen trials met the inclusion criteria, and included a total of 1006 participants. The review found that cognitive-behavioural treatments are probably effective (in terms of reduced chest pain frequency) in the short term, for the treatment of non-cardiac related chest pain. No adverse effects of the psychotherapy were found. Hypnotherapy is also a possible alternative. A limitation of this review is the high variability of the studies included, reflected in a wide range of outcome measures, although there was an overall fairly low risk of bias.
We searched for evidence in August 2018 and found 70 randomised controlled trials (RCTs; this type of trial provides the most reliable results) (involving 19,927 women). Most trials evaluated a group of women who received omega-3 LCPUFA and compared them with a group of women who received something that looked like omega-3 LCPUFA but did not contain it (placebo) or received no omega-3. The trials were mostly undertaken in upper-middle or high-income countries. Some studies included women at increased risk of preterm birth. The quality of the evidence from the included studies ranged from high to very low; this affected the certainty of the findings for different outcomes.
We found the incidence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks) and very preterm birth (before 34 weeks) was lower in women who received omega-3 LCPUFA compared with no additional omega-3. There were also fewer babies with low birthweight. However, omega-3 LCPUFA probably increased the incidence of pregnancies continuing beyond 42 weeks, although there was no difference identified in induction of labour for post-term pregnancies. The risk of the baby dying or being very sick and going to neonatal intensive care may be lower with omega-3 LCPUFA compared with no omega-3. We did not see any differences between groups for serious adverse events for mothers or in postnatal depression. Very few differences between the omega-3 LCPUFA groups and no omega-3 groups were observed in child development and growth.
Eleven trials reported that they had received industry funding. When we omitted these trials from the main outcomes (such as preterm birth and very preterm birth) it made very little, or no difference, to the results. Increasing omega-3 LCPUFA intake during pregnancy, either through supplements or in foods, may reduce the incidence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks and before 34 weeks) and there may be less chance of having a baby with a low birthweight. Women who take omega-3 LCPUFA supplements during pregnancy may also be more likely to have longer pregnancies. More studies are underway and their results will be included in a further update of this review. Future studies could consider if and how outcomes may vary in different populations of women, and could test different ways of increasing omega-3 LCPUFA during pregnancy.
10 studies involving 1349 women. The evidence is current to September 2019. This review found that for women with mTNBC, a chemotherapy containing platinum:
- may increase survival time over chemotherapy without platinum;
- reduces the number of breast cancer recurrences compared to chemotherapy that did not contain platinum but we are uncertain about these results;
- appears to cause tumours to shrink more than chemotherapy without platinum;
- may increase the chance of severe nausea and vomiting compared to treatment without platinum; and
- may increase the chance of anaemia compared to chemotherapy without platinum. Chemotherapy containing platinum may provide a small survival benefit to mTNBC participants, but still large enough to justify its use. This potential benefit needs to be weighed against the higher risks of toxic side effects from platinum-based regimens compared to non-platinum regimens. Further studies are required before a more definitive conclusion can be made.
We wanted to find out if using videolaryngoscopy increased the success and safety of the placement of a breathing tube compared to the direct laryngoscopy technique, in babies who were 0 to 28 days old. We searched for studies that were trying to find out whether video devices were better than the standard approach without video assistance (direct laryngoscopy) for placing breathing tubes in babies. The studies could measure time, the number of attempts, the success rate of the first attempt to place the breathing tube, or side effects.
We compared and summarized the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found eight eligible studies, which included 759 intubation attempts in newborn babies. They reported time, the number of attempts, the success rate of the first attempt to place the breathing tube, and side effects. In summary:
Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of placing a breathing tube on the first attempt, and may result in slightly fewer tries by a care provider to place the breathing tube in sick newborn babies, but does not reduce the amount of time it takes to place the breathing tube.
Videolaryngoscopy may have little or no effect on how many babies have episodes of low oxygen or low heart rate (or both) while the breathing tube is being placed, but the evidence is very uncertain. Videolaryngoscopy may result in little or no difference in the lowest levels of oxygen while the breathing tube is being placed.
Videolaryngoscopy likely results in slightly less injury to the newborn baby’s airway while the breathing tube is being placed.
There were no data available on other adverse effects while the breathing tube is being placed. We found that the included studies were small, we were unable to assess the risk of bias in some, and the study results varied. The care providers who placed the breathing tube knew which device was being used. This decreases our confidence in the results of the review, and the results of further research could differ from the results of this review.
Funding and equipment support was provided in some of the included studies. In some cases, funding sources and declarations of interest were not stated. The evidence is up to date to November 2022.
We identified a broad range of studies of different types of preparations used at different dosages in both adults and children. The evidence is current up to March 2014. We found no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medications in acute cough. Nineteen studies reported adverse effects of these medications and described infrequent, mainly minor side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and drowsiness. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult. While all studies were placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials only a minority reported their methods of allocation and randomisation and there was lack of reporting of blinding of outcome assessors and whether cough outcome measures were validated. In addition, studies supported by pharmaceutical companies or other providers were more likely to have positive results. Studies were very different from each other in terms of treatment types, treatment duration and outcomes measured, making evaluation of overall effectiveness of OTC cough medicines difficult.
The review authors identified eight controlled trials in which a total of 2222 adults were randomised to have balloon angioplasty or drug treatment only. The overall quality of the evidence was considered to be moderate because the methodological quality of the studies varied substantially and two of the studies had not provided sufficient data to be able to assess their risk of bias. Overall, the data were insufficient to show that one treatment was better than the other for preventing loss of kidney function or restenosis of the renal artery. Those treated with balloon angioplasty may require fewer antihypertensive drugs or lower doses and experience a slight improvement in diastolic but not systolic blood pressure. Balloon angioplasty appears to be safe and there were similar numbers of renal and cardiovascular adverse events in participants treated with either approach. A small number of procedural complications of balloon angioplasty were reported (collection of blood outside the blood vessel at the site of catheter insertion (6.5%), dilated groin artery (0.7%), renal artery or kidney perforation or tear (2.5%) as well as deaths shortly before, during or after the procedure (0.4%)). No side effects of medical therapy were reported.
We found six studies that included 477 kidney transplant patients. The majority of these patients had a kidney transplant from a living donor. The overall quality of the studies was low to average, and the main problem was the small number of studies and the small size of the studies. There was no information on funding source for most of the studies.
Compared to normal saline, giving kidney transplant patients solutions that contain less chloride during their transplant operation resulted in lower blood acid levels but did not affect how the transplant kidney worked after surgery, or the number of patients who had high blood potassium levels. Harmful effects were not reported in many studies. In the group of patients who were given lower-chloride fluids, the transplant failed in one patient and one patient rejected the transplant. In the group of patients who were given normal saline, the transplant failed in four patients, and two patients rejected the transplant. However, this is probably an incomplete picture of harmful effects.
We wanted to find out which types of treatment with corticosteroids work best in babies born too early who are at risk of getting BPD. We also wanted to know if the treatments have unwanted side effects. We looked for systematic reviews that included preterm babies at risk of BPD who were treated with corticosteroids. Systematic reviews summarise all the studies on a particular subject.
We sorted the different treatments into the following four categories.
• Effective treatment: more or larger positive effects than negative effects.
• Promising treatment: positive effects, but we are not sure enough yet to use this treatment in everyone. Such treatments need to be studied more.
• Ineffective or possibly unsafe treatment: the treatment is not working or has more or larger negative effects than positive effects.
• No conclusions are possible: we don’t know enough about this treatment. We found nine systematic reviews summarising 88 studies. The studies used various types of treatment with corticosteroids in 9419 preterm babies. Treatments differed in the following ways: type of corticosteroid, age of the baby at the start of treatment, amount of drug given, and the way the drug was given. Effective treatment after the first week of lifemay increase babies' survival, decrease BPD, and seems to be safe in babies at high risk of BPD.
Promising treatment
Giving corticosteroids directly into the windpipe, together with surfactant (a substance that allows the lungs to remain open after each breath, which is commonly used in preterm babies with breathing problems in the first few days after birth), likely results in a positive effect but has not been examined enough yet. This might be a promising treatment in the future.
Ineffective or possibly unsafe treatment in the first week of lifelikely results in a higher chance of surviving without BPD, but has serious unwanted effects (such as bowel perforation and development of spasticity (stiff or rigid muscles)). Treatment with hydrocortisonein the first week of lifemay result in a higher chance of surviving without BPD, but also has too many serious side effects to be used. Treatment with hydrocortisoneafter the first week of lifelikely has no effect on survival or BPD.
No conclusions possible
There is not enough information to know if treating with corticosteroids through inhaling is effective or might be better than infusion or by feeding tube. We have low to moderate confidence in the results of the studies included in the reviews. This is because the types of babies included and the treatments given differed across studies. Also, many of the studies were very small with few participants. As a result, we are uncertain about the best way to use corticosteroids for the prevention or treatment of BPD. The search is current to April 2023.
In July 2012 we searched medical databases for controlled trials of participants who had undergone aortic or arterial surgery and were randomly assigned to either statins or placebo (or standard care). Many vascular surgery patients are already taking statins; therefore we also included trials that randomly assigned participants to different doses of statin. Statin treatment should have been started any time between the decision to operate and performance of the operation and continued for at least 48 hours after the operation. We wanted to investigate the effect of this short-term statin therapy on the risk of death and cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke within 30 days of surgery. We also considered adverse effects of statins such as muscle pain.
We found five studies that compared participants receiving statins with a control treatment or with placebo, but only three of these reported outcomes could be combined in the meta-analyses. These three studies were of high quality but studied only 178 participants in total. This means that evidence was insufficient to allow review authors to determine whether statins improved patient outcomes after surgery. We were also not able to establish whether any adverse effects such as muscle pain were associated with statin use.
We found that two studies had compared different doses of atorvastatin, but evidence was insufficient to determine whether any benefits or risks were associated with using a higher dose.
Given the limited quantity of data obtained from randomized controlled trials, further studies are required to allow investigators to gather better information about whether prescribing statins around the time of vascular surgery can improve outcomes. However, widespread use of statins in patients before they need surgery may make these studies impracticable.
Randomised studies have been successfully conducted in this area but poor study reporting meant that no conclusions could be drawn from them. The benefits or harms of the use of drama therapy in schizophrenia are therefore unclear and further large, high quality studies are required to determine the true value of drama therapy for schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses.
Review authors identified three randomised studies comparing different diets in 192 children and adults with different types of cancer. Other interventions, such as antimicrobial prophylaxis (i.e. prevention of infection via antimicrobial therapy such as antibiotics) and hygiene practices, and definitions of study outcomes also differed between studies, and very limited information on anticancer treatment was given. All studies had methodological problems. Unfortunately, combining the results of included studies was not possible, but at the moment, no evidence from individual studies suggests that a low bacterial diet prevents infection. Data on survival, time from onset of neutropenia to start of fever, duration of empirical (i.e. start of treatment before determination of a definitive diagnosis) antibiotics and antimycotics (i.e. agents that target fungal infection), diet acceptability and quality of life all were evaluated by only one study; for all outcomes, no statistically significant differences between treatment groups were observed. None of the studies evaluated infection-related mortality. It should be noted that 'no evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. No differences between diets were identified, possibly because few patients were included in these studies. On the basis of currently available evidence, the review authors were not able to give recommendations for clinical practice. Additional high-quality research is needed.
We undertook this review to determine the effectiveness of NPPV in patients with severe acute asthma. Six randomised controlled trials were included in the review. Compared to usual medical care alone, NPPV reduced hospitalisations, increased the number of patients discharged from the emergency department, and improved respiratory rate and lung function measurements. The application of NPPV in patients with asthma, despite some promising preliminary results, still remains controversial. Further studies are needed to determine the role of NPPV in the management of severe acute asthma and especially in status asthmaticus.
- More people who received epoetin or darbepoetin died during and up to 30 days after the end of study compared with people who took placebo or underwent standard treatment. The increased risk for people taking epoetin or darbepoetin was 17%. One hundred and fourteen out of 1,000 persons receiving epoetin or darbepoetin died, compared with 98 out of 1,000 persons not receiving epoetin or darbepoetin. We could not identify particular characteristics of people or treatment strategies that increased or decreased the risk for dying.
- Concerning long-term survival people taking epoetin or darbepoetin were 5% more at risk for dying than people taking placebo or receiving standard treatment.
- People receiving epoetin or darbepoetin rated their fatigue symptoms to be an average of 2.08 points improved on a scale of 0-52 points after 3-4 months, compared with people taking placebo or having standard treatment. This improvement, however, is less than the 3.0 point increase which is considered to be the minimum required for the patient to feel a difference in his experience of fatigue-related symptoms using this scale.
- People taking epoetin or darbepoetin rated their fatigue and anaemia symptoms had to be an average of 6.14 points improved after three to four months, on a scale of 0-80 points. This improvement is considered to reflect a positive change in the way patients experience their fatigue and anaemia related symptoms, as it is more than four to five points of increase which is the minimum required for this scale.
- Seven people out of 100 who took epoetin or darbepoetin suffered a thromboembolic event such as stroke and myocardial infarction compared with five people out of 100 who did not receive epoetin or darbepoetin.
- Six out of 100 people receiving epoetin or darbepoetin developed high blood pressure compared with four out of 100 people who took placebo or had standard care.
We wanted to find out if eating food early was associated with nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal distension, the need for a nasogastric tube after surgery, infectious complications, wound complications, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and deep venous thrombosis (blood clots).
We also wanted to find out if early feeding was better than delayed feeding for improving the recovery of bowel function, as represented by the time to first: bowel sound, gas, stool, the start of a regular diet, and the length of hospital stay. In addition, women's satisfaction and quality of life were compared between the two feeding schedules. We searched for studies that looked at early feeding compared with delayed feeding after major gynaecologic surgery, which may be done using an abdominal, vaginal, or laparoscopic approach. We defined early feeding as having fluids or food within 24 hours of surgery. We defined delayed feeding as having fluids or food 24 hours or more after surgery, and only if there were bowel sounds, the passage of gas or stool, and a feeling of hunger. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes. We found seven studies that involved 902 women who underwent major gynaecologic surgery.
- Early feeding may offer some benefits to women. It probably leads to a slightly faster resumption of bowel movements and may result in women starting a solid diet sooner. It might also contribute to a slightly shorter hospital stay.
- Despite these potential advantages associated with early feeding, there was no difference between the women who received early or late feeding on the time to the first passage of gas.
- The effects of early feeding compared to delayed feeding are uncertain for these post-surgical outcomes: the occurrence of nausea and vomiting, and abdominal distension. This review has some limitations that make the findings less certain. We had some uncertainty about most of the evidence. The main problem was that the studies were not 'blinded'. This means that the women and researchers knew who was getting early or delayed feeding. This knowledge could influence how the women reported their symptoms or satisfaction, potentially skewing the results. In addition, the studies were not consistent with each other, which makes it harder to draw firm conclusions. And finally, some studies had very few participants or recorded very few events, which makes their results less reliable. We updated the previous Cochrane review of randomised controlled trials of early and delayed feeding after abdominal gynaecologic surgery. In this update, we also considered women who underwent surgery through vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches. The evidence is up-to-date to June 2023.
We found 23 relevant studies conducted in Europe, North America, Oceania, Israel, and Japan. The studies compared treatment with CCBs versus treatment with other classes of blood pressure-lowering medications in people with hypertension and included 153,849 participants. Follow-up of trial participants ranged from 2 to 5.3 years. There was no difference in deaths from all causes between CCBs and other blood pressure-lowering medications. Diuretics probably reduce total cardiovascular events and congestive heart failure more than CCBs. CCBs probably reduce total cardiovascular events more than beta-blockers. CCBs reduced stroke when compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and reduced heart attack when compared to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), but increased congestive heart failure when compared to ACE inhibitors and ARBs. We assessed the quality of the evidence as mostly moderate, although more trials are desirable.
We searched for evidence (October 2018) and found two trials (involving 99 women) conducted in Canada and the USA. Both trials compared guided imagery with quiet rest. There were no trials comparing guided imagery with no intervention, or other with another non-pharmacological method for hypertension.
The two included studies reported different outcomes and the Intervention frequency was slightly different between the two studies. One study performed guided imagery for 15 minutes at least twice daily for four weeks or until the baby was born (whichever came first). The other study involved guided imagery, self-monitoring of blood pressure, and thermal biofeedback-assisted relaxation training for a total of four hours; the women were instructed to practice the procedures twice daily and complete at least three relaxation breaks each day. The control groups between the two studies were similar - one used quiet rest and the other used quiet rest as bed rest.
Neither trial reported data for our main outcomes of interest: severe hypertension, severe pre-eclampsia, or death of the baby during birth or within the first week of life. The trials provided data for only one of our secondary outcomes of interest.
Low-certainty evidence from the one trial (69 women) suggests that, compared with quiet rest, guided imagery may make little or no difference in the use of antihypertensive drugs. We included two small trials comparing guided imagery with quiet rest. We did not identify any trials comparing guided imagery with no intervention, or another non-pharmacological treatment for hypertension.
The available evidence for this review is sparse and the effect of guided imagery for treating hypertension during pregnancy (compared with quiet rest) remains unclear.
The included trials did not report on any of the main outcomes in this review and only provided low-certainty evidence on the uncertain effect on the use of antihypertensive drugs.
There is insufficient evidence to inform practice about using guided imagery for hypertension in pregnancy.
Large and well-designed studies are needed to identify the effects of guided imagery on hypertension during pregnancy and on other relevant outcomes associated with the short-term and long-term health of mothers and their babies. The trials should also consider the use and costs of health services.
We searched electronic databases of published research studies, looking for all studies of IQCODE in a hospital setting. We searched from the first available papers in scientific databases up to and including January 2013.
We found 13 relevant studies which had results suitable to be combined in a single analysis. Of these papers, six (1352 participants) described studies conducted in “specialist” services such as memory clinics or wards. Three papers (566 participants) described studies conducted in general older adult services and four studies (827 participants) included both specialist and general services.
Summarising the available papers, we found that IQCODE was useful for 'ruling out' possible dementia in the general hospital setting. This means if a person has a low score on IQCODE testing they probably do not have dementia. IQCODE was less useful in specialist memory clinics and psychiatry wards. We also found that a short version of the IQCODE gave similar results to the traditional longer version.
As part of our assessment we looked at whether the design of the available studies was suitable for the study question. We found several instances where the design of the study could be improved. For example, seven of the thirteen studies only included a selection of all the people attending the service who could have been assessed with IQCODE. We also looked at how well researchers reported the conduct and results of their studies. Again, there were many instances where the reporting could be improved. A common issue was not describing the severity of memory and thinking problems in those thought to have dementia, only reported in three of the included studies.
In summary, IQCODE may be a useful tool for assessing adults for possible dementia. There are still a number of unanswered questions around how useful IQCODE may be in hospital settings. For example, before we start using IQCODE routinely we need to describe if it is practical and acceptable to hospital staff, to patients and to their carers.
The review was performed by a team based in research centres in the UK (Glasgow, Leicester, Oxford). We had no external funding specific to this study and we have no conflicts of interest that may have influenced our assessment of the research data.
Approximately 1% of people in industrialised countries have a leg ulcer at some time, mainly caused by poor blood flow back from the legs towards the heart. Skin grafts, either using the patient's own skin, artificial skin or donor skin/cells, have been evaluated to see whether they improve the healing of ulcers. The review of trials found evidence that tissue-engineered skin composed of two layers increases the chance of healing. There was not enough evidence to recommend any other type of graft, and further research is required.
The quality of the evidence for the first trial was low due to poor reporting of study methods. For the second trial, there was high-quality evidence for the absence of clinical manifestations of congenital syphilis on neonates, but moderate-quality evidence for serological cure due to few data. Compared with no intervention, treatment with benzathine penicillin may increase rates of serological cure by the age of three months and possibly reduce the the clinical manifestation of congenital syphilis. There is probably no difference between long-acting benzathine penicillin and procaine benzylpenicillin for treating newborns with congenital syphilis.
In this review we included 14 studies, randomising 1390 participants to either a pre-emptive correction of an access stenosis (i.e. before the access became dysfunctional) or a deferred correction of an access stenosis (i.e. if and when the access became dysfunctional). This review shows that pre-emptive correction of an arteriovenous access stenosis does not improve longevity of the access overall. In people using grafts pre-emptive correction does not reduce the risk of thrombosis or access loss. In people using fistulas pre-emptive stenosis correction reduces the risk of thrombosis and may prolong the longevity of the access. However, this surveillance and pre-emptive correction strategy may increase the number of access-related procedures and procedure-related adverse events.
This systematic review presents, to clinicians and patients, evidence-based data that do not support the use of access surveillance and pre-emptive correction of stenosis in grafts. Although surveillance and pre-emptive correction of stenosis reduce the risk of thrombosis and may reduce the risk of access loss in fistulas, they may also increase the risk of procedure-related adverse events and health-care cost. Large multicentre clinical trials are necessary in this patient population to better clarify potential harms and expected benefits of routine surveillance and pre-emptive correction of fistula stenosis.
The main aim of this review was to find out whether pentoxifylline compared with placebo (an inactive drug) or no drug offers important advantages to babies born early. Only one study of moderate size and quality was identified in this review. This study did not show strong evidence that pentoxifylline offers important advantages to babies born early. We have therefore been unable to determine the effects of pentoxifylline in preventing long-lasting breathing problems in babies born early. Future high-quality studies are needed to answer this question.
There are beds, mattresses and mattress toppers specifically designed for people at risk of pressure ulcers. These can be made of a range of materials (such as foam, fibre, air cells or water bags) and are divided into two groups:
- reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin, unless a person moves or is repositioned; and
- active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body.
We wanted to find out if mattresses and mattress toppers made of foam (a reactive surface):
- prevent pressure ulcers;
- are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
- have health benefits that outweigh their costs (cost-effectiveness); and
- have any unwanted effects. We searched the medical literature for studies that evaluated the effects of mattresses and mattress toppers made of foam. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 29 studies (9566 people, average age: 76 years) that lasted between five days and one year (average: 15 days). The studies compared foam with active and reactive surfaces made of gel, air cells, water bags and other foam types.
Pressure ulcer prevention
The evidence suggests that:
- foam surfaces may increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers when compared with active or reactive air-filled surfaces (8 studies);
- denser memory foam (foam that adapts to a person’s body shape) may be better than lighter memory foam for preventing pressure ulcers if the data on the time it takes to develop a new ulcer is looked at (1 study, duration: 11.5 days);
- flat foam surfaces may be better than ridged foam surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers if the data on the time it takes to develop a new ulcer is looked at (1 study, duration: 1 month).
It is unclear if foam has an effect on pressure ulcers compared to water or gel surfaces.
Other effects
Evidence from one study suggests that foam is probably less cost-effective than active, air-filled surfaces.
We did not find sufficiently robust and clear evidence to determine how foam affects comfort, quality of life and unwanted effects. Most studies were small (101 people on average) and more than half (17 studies) used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019.
This review identified and collated the evidence for these type of resilience-building programmes. Only studies that used an experimental group versus control group design (randomised controlled trial (RCT)/cluster-RCT) were selected for the review. Over 6774 records were screened, with 28 studies selected for inclusion in the review. The programmes included in this review were informed by different theories (‘theoretical orientation’) and delivered in different ways (e.g. on-line/off-line; group-based/individual). There is not yet enough evidence to support the assertion that such programmes can build resilience to symptoms of psychological stress and prevent a diagnosis of PTSD following critical incidents. This said, there are limitations to the existing evidence base. There is significant variety in the ways resilience-building programmes are: theoretically orientated, populations targeted, how they are delivered, setting used, and outcomes measured (with further variety in scales used within specific outcomes). This has made drawing conclusions on how effective these programmes are, difficult as they are often not sufficiently similar to make fair comparisons. Future evaluations need to overcome these limitations, thus allowing us to determine if these programmes have value in pre-deployment preparation and training.
randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) where participants had come to medical attention because they had taken a paracetamol overdose, intentionally or by accident, regardless of the amount of paracetamol taken or the age, sex, or other medical conditions of the person involved.
There are many different interventions that can be used to try to treat people with paracetamol poisoning. These interventions include decreasing the absorption of the paracetamol ingested and hence decreasing the amount absorbed into the bloodstream. The agents include activated charcoal (that binds paracetamol together in the stomach), gastric lavage (stomach washout to remove as much paracetamol as possible), or ipecacuanha (a syrup that is swallowed and causes vomiting (being sick)). Paracetamol once absorbed into the bloodstream goes to the liver where the majority is broken down to harmless products. However, a small amount of the medicine is converted into a toxic product that the liver can normally handle but, when large amounts of paracetamol are taken, the liver is overwhelmed. As a consequence, the toxic product can damage the liver leading to liver failure, kidney failure, and in some cases death. Other interventions to treat paracetamol poisoning include medicines (antidotes) that may decrease the amount of the toxic products (such as a medicine called cimetidine) or breakdown the toxic products (including medicines called methionine, cysteamine, dimercaprol, or acetylcysteine). Finally, attempts can be made to remove paracetamol and its toxic products from the bloodstream using special blood cleansing equipment. All these treatments were examined.
We found 11 randomised clinical trials with 700 participants. Most of these trials looked at different treatments. activated charcoal, gastric lavage, and ipecacuanha may reduce absorption of paracetamol if started within one to two hours of paracetamol ingestion, but the clinical benefit was unclear. Activated charcoal seems to be the best choice if the person is able to take it. People may not be able to take charcoal if they are drowsy and some may dislike its taste or texture (or both).
Of the treatments that remove the toxic products of paracetamol, acetylcysteine seems to reduce the rate of liver injury from paracetamol poisoning. Furthermore, it has fewer side effects than some other antidotes such as dimercaprol and cysteamine; its superiority to methionine was unclear. Acetylcysteine should be given to people with paracetamol poisoning at risk of liver damage, risk is determined by the dose ingested, time of ingestion, and investigations.
More recent clinical trials have looked at ways to decrease side effects of intravenous (into a vein) acetylcysteine treatment, by altering the way it is given. These trials have shown that by using a slower infusion and lower initial dose of acetylcysteine, the proportion of side effects such as nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting, and allergy (the body's bad reaction to the medicine such as a rash) may be lowered. this review of interventions for paracetamol poisoning found surprisingly few published randomised clinical trials for this very common condition. Furthermore, the majority of trials had few participants and all were at high risk of bias. Accordingly, the quality of the evidence should be considered as low or very low.
We looked at clinical trials that compared the two kinds of inhalers to find the effects of each on health and well-being in patients with COPD. We found seven studies (involving 5997 participants) comparing the long-term benefits and side effects of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists for treating COPD. Overall, we found no significant difference between the two drugs in the number of people having an exacerbation (worsening of COPD symptoms). More people taking inhaled corticosteroids suffered episodes of pneumonia compared to people using long-acting beta2-agonists, although  pneumonia was extremely rare in both groups. Inhaled corticosteroids do not improve lung function as much as long-acting beta2-agonists but did improve patients' quality of life more than long-acting beta2-agonists. The differences in lung function and quality of life were rather small.
We found 19 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) evaluating mainly women receiving different doses of fluoxetine. A total of 1280 overweight or obese participants received fluoxetine and 936 participants received mainly placebo or another anti-obesity medication. The participants in the included studies were followed up for periods varying between three weeks and one year. For our main comparison group — fluoxetine compared with placebo — and for all fluoxetine doses there was a 2.7 kg weight loss in favour of fluoxetine. We are uncertain, however, if an additional study would again show a benefit for fluoxetine. A total of 399 out of 627 participants (63.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 352 out of 626 participants (56.2%) receiving placebo experienced a side effect. Dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea were observed approximately twice as often after fluoxetine compared to placebo. A total of 15 out of 197 participants (7.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 12 out of 196 participants (6.1%) receiving placebo experienced depression. The studies did not report on death from any cause, health-related quality of life and socioeconomic effects.
This evidence is up to date as of December 2018. The overall certainty of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because of the small number of studies per outcome measurement and the small number of participants.
Depression is common in young people and can contribute to a variety of negative outcomes, such as poor academic functioning, difficulties in peer and family relationships, increases in substance use, and both attempted and completed suicide. This review contained 19 trials (with a total of 3353 participants) testing the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants (these are antidepressants developed and used since tricyclic antidepressants were developed). These include the well-known selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that have an impact primarily on the brain chemical called serotonin, as well as several other newer classes of antidepressants now being used, which aim to target noradrenaline and dopamine as well as serotonin and include selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs) and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs)) for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. Based on 14 of the trials (2490 participants in total), there was evidence that those treated with an antidepressant had lower depression severity scores than those on placebo, however, the size of this difference was small. Based on 17 trials (3229 participants in total), there was evidence of an increased risk (64%) of suicide-related outcomes for those on antidepressants compared with those given placebo. Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed an antidepressant. There was no evidence that one particular type of newer generation antidepressant had a larger effect than the others when compared to placebo.
It is unclear how meaningful the results regarding the effectiveness of these medications are in terms of a young person's day-to-day functioning. Children and adolescents with other conditions (such as anxiety, substance use disorder or a conduct disorder) as well as depression, and those at risk of suicide, were often excluded from trials. However, these young people are more representative of the population who present to clinical services, therefore it is not possible to predict how they would respond to antidepressants. There was often insufficient information to judge the quality of the trials accurately. With these limitations, it is difficult to answer questions about the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants for treating depression in children and adolescents. Clinicians need to provide accurate information to children and adolescents, and their families, about the uncertainties regarding the benefits and risks of newer generation antidepressant medication as a treatment option for depression. If a decision to use medication is agreed then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations and, if used, the risk of suicide should be assessed and monitored particularly closely.
We searched the medical literature up to 18 April 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as these provide the most reliable evidence. We identified 31 relevant RCTs that contained results from 2392 participants and compared these medicines either against placebo (inactive treatment) or another medicine or blood product. The RCTs focused on three types of factors that may improve blood clotting: fibrinogen (a clotting factor that increases clot strength), clotting factor XIII (important for holding clots together) and prothrombin complex concentrate (a combination of four precursor clotting factors).
The trials either gave these medicines before bleeding occurred (prophylactically) or to treat existing bleeding (therapeutically). Most trials focused on surgery, especially heart surgery, trauma, and bleeding after childbirth.
Seventeen of the RCTs we identified had industrial support, eight had unclear funding sources and six declared non-industrial funding. No medicine had any effect on the risk of dying, regardless of clinical setting or how the medicine was used. However, our certainty in the results is low and this finding may change in the future when new studies are published.
No medicine increased the risk of harmful clots in the veins or arteries, but our certainty in these findings is low.
Prophylactic fibrinogen reduced bleeding after heart and orthopaedic surgery compared to placebo. Prophylactic fibrinogen, compared to placebo, almost halved the need for blood transfusion following heart surgery, and reduced the need by three-quarters in other surgery. Fibrinogen reduced the need for blood transfusion when used to treat bleeding.
Prophylactic factor XIII reduced bleeding after heart surgery.
Sample sizes in future randomised trials need to be greatly increased in order to show any differences in overall survival and death due to bleeding. Our certainty in the evidence is low, but future research may change the findings of this review. The low certainty of the evidence makes it difficult to draw conclusions about how well these medicines work and whether they should be used in current health care. Further research is required in larger-scale RCTs to determine the benefit and costs of these treatments and whether this outweighs their risks.
A much smaller amount of blood is needed for the lactate test than to measure pH. This review identified two studies of 3348 mother-baby pairs that compared lactate and pH testing in labour. Lactate testing was more likely to be successful than pH testing, but with no differences in newborn outcomes, including the number of babies with low Apgar scores, low pH in their cord blood or admissions to the neonatal intensive care nursery. There were no differences in the number of mothers having caesarean sections, forceps or vacuum births between the two groups. We conclude that lactate testing in labour may be more likely to be successfully achieved than pH testing.
Our evidence is current to May 2015. We found three trials in total. Two trials recruited adults from the general population or from among hospital staff in Finland. These trials (total 253 adults) compared intranasal steroid sprays, which allow steroids to be puffed into the nostrils, to sprays containing placebo only. We found a third trial, which recruited 100 children referred to outpatient clinics in an Iranian paediatric hospital. This trial compared intranasal steroid spray to no spray and gave oral antibiotics to all participants. Neither of the two trials comparing steroid spray to placebo spray in adults showed a benefit of steroids across a range of different measures. The trial comparing steroid spray to no spray in children did find some evidence of benefit but we rated the quality of the evidence from this trial as very poor and the results were unclear. We could not combine the results of the trials to assess this question further. There were no reports of adverse events. The available evidence suggests that we should not use intranasal steroids for the common cold. However, as we found only three small trials, we cannot be sure that there is no effect without performing larger, well-designed trials.
However, our primary research for this review showed that there was no strong evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs in stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids. The included studies were few and of low quality. Limited, weak evidence showed that some formulae, when including Radix Sanguisorbae, Radix Rehmanniae, Fructus Sophorae, etc., may alleviate some symptoms caused by haemorrhoids. These symptoms include hematochezia and congestive haemorrhoidal cushions, in the short term. Additional, standardised trials are needed for meta-analysis to draw a final conclusion.
We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) for this review. We include 11 RCTs involving 13,627 participants, with an average age from 51 to 74 years. Length of follow-up ranged from four weeks to 36 months. Low-certainty evidence showed no difference between RIs and ACE inhibitors for deaths from any cause, for heart attacks, for serious side effects or for leaving the study because of side effects. Low-certainty evidence suggested that RIs reduce blood pressure more than ACE inhibitors do, but this could have been due to bias in the design and conduct of the studies. More independent RCTs are needed to assess illnesses and deaths, and to see if the difference in blood pressure-lowering is real.
The prevalence of depression in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is high; a study has shown it to be four times that of women without PCOS. Therefore, systematic evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants for women with PCOS is important. We found no evidence to support the use or non-use of antidepressants in women with PCOS, with or without depression. Well-designed and well-conducted randomised controlled trials with double blinding should be conducted.
Critical appraisal involves interpreting information, in particular information within research papers, in a systematic and objective manner. This review looked at whether teaching critical appraisal skills to health professionals led to changes in processes of care, patient outcomes, health professionals' knowledge of how to critically appraise research papers, or all three. The review found that teaching critical appraisal skills to health professionals may improve their knowledge. However, there was a lack of good quality evidence as to whether teaching critical appraisal skills led to changes in the process of care or to changes in patient outcomes.
The authors of this Cochrane review looked for studies which showed how effective visibility aids are for protecting pedestrians and cyclists. They focused their search on a type of study called a randomised controlled trial, which compares two similar groups of people who only differ on the issue being studied, for instance, the rate of crashes in communities with and without introduction of visibility aids. The authors found no studies that compared number of crashes but to date they have found 42 studies which compare driver detection of people with or without visibility aids. These studies showed that fluorescent materials in yellow, red and orange improved driver detection during the day; while lamps, flashing lights and retroreflective materials in red and yellow, particularly those with a 'biomotion' configuration (taking advantage of the motion from a pedestrian's limbs), improved pedestrian recognition at night. Although these visibility measures help drivers see pedestrians and cyclists, more research should be done to determine whether the increased visibility actually does prevent deaths and serious injuries.
We searched databases until December 2015 for randomized controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) in adults (aged 18 years or over), diagnosed with late-stage stomach cancer. We found 11 trials (4014 participants) that met our selection requirements and randomized people to receive targeted treatment plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Adding molecular-targeted treatment to chemotherapy may have a small effect on survival and on stopping further development of the disease, compared with chemotherapy alone, but the evidence is of low quality. The treatment may increase the likelihood that tumors get smaller (low-quality evidence), but there is insufficient evidence to know how much of a difference it can make to the person's quality of life (very low-quality evidence). It probably increases the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events (moderate-quality evidence). Currently, the evidence is of low quality for survival outcomes, mainly due to the type of study design, and the inconsistencies between the results of individual studies. We therefore suggest that well-designed clinical trials should be performed, to improve the evidence base.
We only found two small trials involving 79 patients; the results of the review suggested that anticoagulant drugs are probably safe and may be beneficial for people with sinus thrombosis but these results are not conclusive.
The review found that patients treated within a care pathway may be less likely to suffer some complications (e.g. urine infections), and more likely to have certain tests (e.g. brain scans). However, the use of care pathways may also reduce the patient's likelihood of functioning independently when discharged from hospital, their quality of life, and their satisfaction with hospital care. Currently, there is not enough evidence to justify introducing care pathways for the routine care of all patients with stroke. Further research is needed to find out if care pathways for stroke do more good than harm.
We found one trial from the UK, which included 15 participants with delirium. The average age of the participants was 82.5 years; eight participants were male and seven were female. Seven participants also had a history of dementia. This trial compared rivastigmine (a type of cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of dementia) with an inactive treatment (placebo). The trial did not show any difference in effect between those participants given rivastigmine and those given placebo. The study was conducted and reported appropriately, but the small number of participants limits any conclusions that could be made about rivastigmine as a treatment for delirium.
Electronic bibliographic databases were searched up to 11 July 2010. Fifteen randomised controlled trials (1660 participants) looking at the effectiveness of patient education strategies for neck disorders were included. Of the 15 selected trials, only one trial depicting moderate quality evidence favoured the educational video for acute WAD. The remaining trials showed that patient education trials did not demonstrate evidence of benefit or favoured the comparison treatment being exercise for pain. Other outcomes were less frequently reported and did not yield results that diverged from those associated with pain. Participants who received advice to stay active reported little or no difference in pain compared with those who received no treatment, treatments focusing on rest, treatments focusing on exercise, physiotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy. Additionally, stress-management therapies, when compared with no treatment, did not seem to have an effect on pain intensity in patients with mechanical neck disorders. Finally, self-care strategies (ergonomics, exercise, self-care, relaxation) do not seem to have an effect on pain when compared with no treatment.
No adverse events were reported in the trials.
In summary, the review authors concluded that there is no strong evidence for the effectiveness of educational interventions in various neck disorders.
In total we included 25 RCTs and 3096 participants in this review update. Only one trial included patients with acute LBP (pain duration less than four weeks), while all the others included patients with sub-acute (four to 12 weeks) or chronic LBP (12 weeks or longer). In three studies, massage was applied using a mechanical device (such as a metal bar to increase the compression to the skin or a vibrating instrument), and in the remaining trials it was done using the hands. Pain intensity and quality were the most common outcomes measured in these studies, followed by back-related function, such as walking, sleeping, bending and lifting weights. Seven studies did not report the sources of funding, Sixteen studies were funded by not-for-profit organizations. One study reported not receiving any funding, and one study was funded by a College of Massage Therapists. There were eight studies comparing massage to interventions that are not expected to improve outcomes (inactive controls) and 13 studies comparing massage to other interventions expected to improve outcomes (active controls). Massage was better than inactive controls for pain and function in the short-term, but not in the long-term follow-up. Massage was better than active controls for pain both in the short and long-term follow-ups, but we found no differences for function, either in the short or long-term follow-ups. There were no reports of serious adverse events in any of these trials. The most common adverse events were increased pain intensity in 1.5% to 25% of the participants. The quality of the evidence for all comparisons was graded "low " or "very low" which means that we have very little confidence in these results. This is because most of the included studies were small and had methodological flaws.
Psychotherapeutic approaches, mainly cognitive behavior therapy, and antidepressant medication are the two treatment modalities that have received most support in controlled outcome studies of bulimia nervosa. Using a more conservative statistical approach, combination treatments were superior to single psychotherapy. This was the only statistically significant difference between treatments. The number of trials might be insufficient to show the statistical significance of a 19% absolute risk reduction in efficacy favouring psychotherapy or combination treatments over single antidepressants. Psychotherapy appeared to be more acceptable to subjects. When antidepressants were combined with psychological treatments, acceptability of the latter was significantly reduced.
We searched scientific databases and identified 12 clinical trials involving 4714 participants aged 18 years and older with atrial fibrillation. The participants were randomly (like a flip of a coin) put into one of two or more groups. The groups were: continuing the blood thinner at the time of the procedure or stopping the blood thinner either for several days or by one or two doses before the procedure with or without giving additional heparin.
The trials reported on the risks of stroke, major bleeding, and minor bleeding after a follow-up period of about 30 days after the procedure. The included trials examined different ablation procedures as well as different blood thinners, including Coumadin and the new oral blood thinners such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran. Ten trials were conducted in East Asian populations (Japan, China, and South Korea). Drug companies funded two trials. The evidence is current to 5 January 2021. Due to the uncertainty of the evidence, after combining the results from the 12 clinical trials in this review, we are unsure about advising one strategy over another with the current evidence. The decision to continue, completely stop or withhold one or two doses of the blood thinner before the procedure should be individualised based on the patient's risks of stroke and bleeding until more well-designed clinical trials are available to inform a conclusive decision. The evidence should be interpreted with caution. The review results are limited by variations in most trial comparisons, low numbers of events, trials being conducted in only one medical setting, and mostly described the intervention in East Asian populations. Further high-quality trials are needed to find the ideal strategy for handling blood thinners at the time of the ablation procedure without increasing harm.
We wanted to see which interventions compared with their relative comparators would reduce burn-related itch.
For each intervention, we looked at:
- change in burn-related itch;
- harmful effects (for example, drowsiness) after treatment;
- value for money;
- pain;
- participants' perceived satisfaction with the intervention;
- wound healing;
- quality of life. We included studies that recruited participants of any age, and either sex, who experienced itch on the burn, grafted, or donor site and were treated in any care setting. We searched for studies where:
- participants had established burn-related itch (but not those that were at risk for burn-related itch);
- participants were randomised to assess the effect of different interventions with respect to relevant comparators. We included 25 studies evaluating 21 interventions with a total of 1166 participants. Six studies compared neuromodulatory agents with antihistamine or placebo comparators. Four studies compared different types of lasers with either untreated or placebo comparators. Two studies compared electrical stimulation with either standard care or sham stimulation. Six studies compared different types of physical modalities (e.g. massage therapy, therapeutic touch, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, enhanced education on silicone gel sheeting) with relevant comparators. Five studies compared different types of topical therapies (e.g. silicone gel, hydrogel, enalapril ointment, Provase moisturiser, and beeswax and herbal oil cream) with relevant comparators. The other two studies compared different combination and herbal therapies.
- While all studies reported change in burn-related itch, only four reported harmful effects. Value for money, participants' perceived satisfaction with the intervention, and wound healing were not reported in any of the included studies.
- In terms of neuromodulatory agents, while gabapentin, pregabalin, and doxepin may be more effective in reducing postburn itch compared with oral antihistamines, we have higher confidence that ondansetron probably reduces postburn itch compared with oral antihistamines.
- In terms of topical therapies, CQ-01 (hydrogel) may be more effective in reducing postburn itch compared with relevant controls. Enalapril ointment probably reduces postburn itch compared with placebo control. Silicone gel cream and Provase moisturiser may have little to no effect on postburn itch. The impact of beeswax and herbal oil cream on postburn itch could not be determined due to unavailable data.
- In terms of physical modalities, enhanced education on silicone gel sheeting may be more effective in reducing postburn itch compared with conventional education. Massage therapy and extracorporeal shock wave therapy may be more effective in reducing postburn itch compared with relevant controls. We are not very confident in the evidence because there were only one or two studies available for each comparison and most of the studies recruited a small number of participants (46 participants on average). Most studies used methods that could introduce errors in their results, such as participants being aware of which treatment group they were assigned to. This summary is up-to-date as of September 2022.
We wanted to know whether PUFA supplements improve ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD.
Although there were some limited data in the original review that suggested PUFA improved symptoms of ADHD, there is currently little evidence that PUFA supplementation is beneficial. It was important to update the evidence to incorporate new studies that have been published since the original review. We searched for all trials that compared PUFA to placebo (dummy pill), medicines, or psychological or medical therapies in children or adolescents with ADHD. We searched 13 databases and two trials registers up to October 2021. We found 24 new studies in this update, bringing the total number of studies included in the review to 37, which involved more than 2374 children and adolescents with ADHD. Seven studies were conducted in Iran; four each in the USA and Israel; two each in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK; and one each in Brazil, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan.
Thirty-six studies compared PUFA to placebo. Treatment with PUFA lasted between two weeks and six months.
Although there was some evidence that PUFA could improve ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents, most of the evidence indicated that PUFA did not improve ADHD symptoms such as inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity. PUFA probably makes little to no difference to overall side effects or whether a person drops out of a study (i.e. does not complete it). We are confident that PUFA has no effect on ADHD symptoms when compared to placebo. Although there was some evidence that ADHD symptoms may be more likely to improve in children and adolescents receiving PUFA compared to those receiving placebo, we have little confidence in this finding.
We are fairly confident that there are no differences between PUFA and placebo groups in overall side effects or dropout.
Limitations of the analyses included small sample sizes, variability of selection criteria, variability of the type and dosage of supplementation, and short follow-up times.
We found 67 studies that involved 3427 adults. We found no studies for children. The treatments for sleep included relaxation, exercise, medicines, education, psychological support, acupressure, music, aromatherapy, and massage. Generally, the studies were small and most did not tell us about the benefits and safety of the treatments. We did not find good information about relaxation, exercise, or medicines. We found that acupressure may reduce the amount of time it takes to get to sleep and may increase the time spent asleep. But these effects on sleep were not seen when acupressure was compared against "pretend" or "sham" acupressure. There was not enough information to learn about side-effects of treatments, or to know about treatments that are designed to help improve breathing when asleep. Information about ways to help improve sleep for people with kidney disease is not ready to help patients directly. New research is very likely to change our knowledge about treatments for sleep among people with kidney disease.
This review includes 14 trials, randomizing a total of 8033 women, and showed that a policy of early routine augmentation for mild delays in labour progress resulted in a modest reduction of the caesarean section rate compared with expectant management. The reduction in caesarean sections was most evident in the 11 trials looking at prevention of abnormal progression, rather than therapy (three trials). In these women, the time from admission to giving birth was also reduced (mean difference 1.3 hours).
The trials did not provide sufficient evidence on indicators of maternal or neonatal health, including women’s satisfaction and views on the experience. Documentation of other aspects of care, such as continuous professional support, mobility and positions during labour, was limited as was the degree of contrast between groups. Women in the control group also received oxytocin but often later than in the intervention group. The severity of delay which was sufficient to justify interventions remains to be defined.
We included six studies that investigated zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia. The studies were conducted in Bangladesh, India, Peru and South Africa and involved 5193 children aged from two to 59 months. Children received either zinc or a similar-looking treatment that did not contain zinc. In two studies, children were also given vitamin A. All included studies were funded. Of these, three explicitly mentioned that funding agencies had no role in the design and results of the study. Zinc supplementation was significantly associated with reducing the incidence and prevalence of pneumonia among children aged from two to 59 months. On subgroup analysis, we found that a more stringent diagnosis (radiological examination) increased the reduction in pneumonia incidence. Overall, evidence quality was assessed as low on GRADE assessment.
We wanted to know whether systemic JAK inhibitors, in addition to usual care, are effective for people with COVID-19 when compared to usual care with or without a placebo (a treatment that looks and tastes the same as the study drug but with no active ingredient), and whether they cause unwanted effects. We were particularly interested in:
• number of deaths from any cause up to 60 days after treatment, or longer if reported;
• whether people got better or worse after treatment, based on their need for breathing support;
• unwanted effects of the treatment and infections acquired in hospital. We searched for studies that reported on people with COVID-19 who received systemic JAK inhibitors together with usual care, or usual care alone (plus/minus placebo). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria about the reliability of the evidence. We found 6 suitable studies involving 11,145 people with COVID-19. All studies compared systemic JAK inhibitors (baricitinib in 4 studies, tofacitinib in 1 study and ruxolitinib in 1 study) to usual care (in addition to placebo), and were performed in hospitalised people. We did not find studies performed in outpatients. Most participants needed oxygen supplementation through low-flow devices (7220 participants) and few (463 participants) were mechanically ventilated at the study entry. We also identified 13 ongoing studies and 9 studies that are completed/terminated but unpublished yet. Systemic JAK inhibitors plus usual care compared to usual care alone probably lead to fewer deaths from all causes at up to day 28 and lead to fewer deaths from all causes up to day 60 in the studies. It was not possible to identify subgroups of participants (according to severity of illness) who might benefit most from treatment with JAK inhibitors. Systemic JAK inhibitors probably make little or no difference in improvement in clinical status. They probably decrease the risk of worsening of clinical status. Systemic JAK inhibitors probably make little or no difference in the rate of unwanted effects, and probably decrease slightly the occurrence of serious unwanted effects. Systemic JAK inhibitors may result in little or no difference in the rate of infections acquired in hospital. As current studies on systemic JAK inhibitors in outpatients are lacking, evidence is limited in this group of people with COVID-19. Studies used different ways to assess and report unwanted effects, especially in regard to infections acquired in hospital.
In accordance with the living approach of this review, we will continually update our search and include eligible trials to fill this evidence gap. The evidence is up to date to February 2022. We monitor newly published studies weekly using the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and have incorporated all new trials identified from this source until the first week of April 2022.
We searched for evidence in April 2017 and found two randomised controlled trials, conducted in outpatient departments of the same two hospitals in the USA, between 1993 and 2001. One trial was sponsored by a drug company. The trials randomised a total of 514 pregnant women (347 women analysed), at an average gestational age of 22 weeks. Both trials had a follow-up of 14 days.
We were unable to pool the results because the trials used different comparisons. One trial compared ceftriaxone (125 mg, intramuscular) with cefixime (400 mg, oral), and the other trial assessed a higher dose of ceftriaxone (250 mg, intramuscular) versus either amoxicillin (3 g, oral) plus probenecid (1 g, oral) or spectinomycin (2 g, intramuscular). We did not include data from the spectinomycin group because this medication is no longer produced.
We found no clear difference in the rate of cure of gonococcal infection (both genital and unrelated to the genital organs) for the different treatment groups, which was in the order of 89% to 96% (very low-quality evidence).
Trials did not report on the incidence of obstetric complications, disseminated gonococcal infection in the mother, or ophthalmia neonatorum in the baby.
They provided little information on side effects of the antibiotic regimens. One trial reported one case of vomiting in the oral amoxacillin plus probenecid group. Trials reported pain at the injection sites, but did not report numbers or severity. Hyperberbilurrubinemia (where the baby has too much bilirubin in the blood) was more frequent in newborns whose mothers were exposed to ceftriaxone. There was no clear difference between groups for neonatal malformation. We found high levels of cure of gonococcal infection in pregnancy with the given antibiotic regimens, but here was not enough evidence to support one particular regimen over another.
Despite high levels of cure, our confidence in the results of this review is very low because both included trials were small, did not blind women to which treatment they received, and had a high number of withdrawals (28% and 41%), meaning they were at high risk of bias. Therefore, there is a need for high-quality trials to be conducted to assess the clinical effectiveness and potential harms of antibiotics for treating gonorrhoea in pregnancy women.
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of bronchodilators in infants with bronchiolitis. We found 30 trials that included a total of 1922 infants, in several countries. The evidence is current up to January 2014. We analyzed studies done in outpatient and inpatient settings separately. All bronchodilators were included in the review except for epinephrine because it is reviewed in another Cochrane review. Albuterol (otherwise known as salbutamol) is commonly used in studies, so we also reviewed this bronchodilator as a subgroup. We found no effect of bronchodilators on oxygen saturation. Infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis showed no significant benefit of bronchodilator treatment. This review also found that bronchodilators do not reduce the need for hospitalization, do not shorten the length of stay in hospital and do not shorten the length of the illness at home. Reviewing the subgroup of studies using albuterol (salbutamol), we found no effect of this bronchodilator on oxygen saturation or clinical scores. Side effects of bronchodilators include rapid heart beat, decrease in oxygen and shakiness. Given these side effects, little evidence that they are effective and the expense associated with these treatments, bronchodilators are not helpful in the management of bronchiolitis. This review is limited by the small number of studies that use the same measures and methods. For example, only 22 studies included only infants wheezing for the first time. Older studies included children who had wheezed before and may have had asthma. Thus these older studies favor the use of bronchodilators. Newer studies that excluded infants with prior wheezing and had a better study design do not show a benefit of bronchodilators. This review is also limited by the small number of infants included in each study. Lastly, clinical scores used to measure the effect of the bronchodilators in some studies may vary from one observer to the next, making this measure unreliable. Studies that include more infants, use better measures and have a stronger study design are needed to define the effectiveness of these medications.
We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing endometrial ablation or resection and hysterectomy as treatment for HMB. The studies excluded women who had gone through the menopause or had cancer (or precancer) of the uterus. Women having EA/ER are probably less likely to perceive an improvement in HMB and more likely to require surgery for treatment failure compared to women having open hysterectomy. They probably have a similar quality of life and satisfaction rates, and may also have similar proportions of serious side effects. Some uncommon but important complications, such as infection and bleeding, are more common during open hysterectomy than with EA/ER.
Women having EA/ER may have a similar rate of perceiving HMB improvement, but may be less likely to have an objective decrease in blood loss, compared to women having minimally invasive hysterectomy. The EA/ER group probably have a lower quality of life and satisfaction rate. The rate of serious side effects is probably similar but women having EA/ER are probably at increased risk of surgery for treatment failure when compared to minimally invasive hysterectomy. The time taken for women to return to normal activity was shorter with EA/ER than with minimally invasive hysterectomy.
Women having EA/ER may be less likely to perceive an improvement in HMB and an improvement in general health compared to women having an unspecified route of hysterectomy (or at surgeon's discretion). EA/ER probably increases the chances of having surgery for treatment failure, but decreases the chances of any serious side effects and has shorter time to return to normal activity if compared to the unspecified route of hysterectomy. Both surgical treatments are generally safe, with low complication rates. There is no clear evidence of a difference on the total number of serious side effects between both surgical techniques. However, open hysterectomy and unspecified route of hysterectomy were both associated with a higher chance of individual complications such as infection and bleeding, whereas there was no difference in these outcomes when EA/ER was compared against minimally invasive hysterectomy. Evidence reported in this review ranged from very low to moderate quality, which suggests that further research may change the result. However, although most of the evidence is moderate, we do not think this will change with further studies. It is moderate because of high risk of differences between groups in the care provided, and in this case, blinding is not feasible due to the nature of the procedures.
This systematic review identified six trials which included 937 participants with macular oedema secondary to CRVO (as of 29 October 2013). The trials compared sham injections with one of four types of anti-VEGF agents: aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye, Eylea), bevacizumab (Avastin), pegaptanib sodium (Macugen) and ranibizumab (Lucentis). All trials treated participants for at least six months. Three trials were multicentre, international trials and three were conducted in Norway, Sweden or the USA. Overall, treatment with anti-VEGF agents increased the chance of a significant gain in vision (at least 3 lines on the vision chart) at six months by more than two and a half times, compared to no treatment. Furthermore, the risk of losing significant vision (at least 3 lines on the vision chart) was reduced by 80% in those receiving anti-VEGF therapy compared to those receiving no treatment. No significant safety concerns were identified at six or 12 months, but the available studies do not allow a conclusion about their long-term effectiveness and safety to be drawn. Nevertheless, the availability of anti-VEGF treatment for CRVO macular oedema represents an important advance in the clinical management options for this sight-threatening disease. The six trials included in this review were high quality and consistently demonstrated visual benefit from anti-VEGF injections.
In January and February 2012, we did a computer search for studies of hormones tested for contraception in men. We also looked at reference lists of articles. We considered randomized controlled trials in any language. We wrote to trial authors to find other studies we may have missed.
We found 33 studies. The focus of the trials was having no sperm found in semen. The percent of men who achieved no sperm varied widely. We found a few major differences and list them here. 1) Implants plus injected testosterone worked better than a pill plus testosterone patch. 2) Adding a hormone pill improved the effect of testosterone injected weekly. 3) A hormone pill also improved the effect of a testosterone injection with more injections at 6 and 12 weeks. 4) A lower dose pill did not work as well as a higher dose when testosterone was put under the skin (implant). 5) When used with implants, a lower dose of injected testosterone led to no sperm more often than a higher dose. 6) An injected hormone plus injected testosterone led to no sperm more often when given every 8 weeks versus 12 weeks. 7) Four implants of a male hormone worked better than two implants.
Several trials showed good results for the percent with no sperm. Five trials studied testosterone and another hormone. The other hormones were desogestrel, etonogestrel, and levonorgestrel.
No hormonal birth control for men is ready for general use. Most trials were small pilot studies trying out different hormone treatments. Larger trials with better methods are needed to test good leads in this area.
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) in July 2021. No new RCTs were identified in addition to the two previously identified very small RCTs. Only one RCT (involving 11 women and their babies) contributed data to the review, so it is not possible to draw any conclusions from such a small number of women and babies. To the extent that the study reported data, the certainty of the evidence was very low. We found no strong evidence from RCTs to favour either planned hospital birth or planned home birth for pregnant women at low risk of complications. Several things have been added to the review in this update. Most importantly, the evidence has been placed in the context of today. As advised in the updated version of the Cochrane Handbook, we have also a) added a conceptual framework to illustrate the proposed mechanism of action of the complex intervention ‘planned hospital birth’, and b) reassessed the evidence using a whole range of new tools, methodologies, and terminology. These exercises did not lead to a substantially different interpretation of the available evidence, but the implications have changed. There is not enough evidence from RCTs (considered the best form of evidence of effectiveness) to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. Also, further RCTs are not considered feasible, and they are no longer considered appropriate by many midwives, obstetricians, and parents. As the quality of evidence from observational studies is steadily increasing, it might be useful to include evidence from properly performed systematic reviews of observational studies in future updates of this review.
We planned to rate the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low , low , moderate , or high . Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results.
We were unable to rate the quality of the body of evidence as there was no evidence to support or refute the use of paracetamol for chronic non-cancer pain in children or adolescents.
For this review, we searched for all of the surgical procedures for trigeminal neuralgia. We found 11 studies, which included 496 patients, but only three had sufficient outcome data to report. These three studies, which involved a total of 181 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and form the basis of this review. The primary aim of all three studies was to determine if one technique was better than the other. All three included studies evaluated destructive techniques. None of the three studies evaluated the non-destructive procedure of microvascular decompression and this is a major drawback in the literature.
One study compared two different techniques of radiofrequency thermocoagulation, in 40 participants six months after the procedure. This technique involves heating the nerve by passing an electrical current through the tip of a special needle which has been introduced through the skin into a hole in the base of the skull and into the ganglion from which the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve branch out (Gasserian ganglion). If the radiofrequency was given as pulsed treatment (which causes the tip of the needle to heat up intermittently and not continuously) the original pain in all participants returned by three months. The continuous radiofrequency treatment then had to be applied, and these participants then achieved pain control comparable to those who had received continuous radiofrequency throughout. Changes in sensation ranging from mild to severe numbness were common in the conventional (continuous) radiofrequency treatment group.
A second trial, in 87 participants, looked at using one or two isocentres (specific points in the nerve) to deliver radiation to the trigeminal nerve just as it leaves the brainstem inside the skull. Use of medication afterwards was considered a surrogate measure for pain. Use of two isocentres increased the occurrence of sensory loss as a complication. Increased age and prior surgery were predictors for poorer pain relief. There were insufficient data given to judge the effectiveness of one procedure better than the other.
A third study compared two techniques for performing radiofrequency thermocoagulation of the Gasserian ganglion in 54 participants. The study compared two ways of introducing the needle and guiding it, using either X-rays or a special neuronavigation system. Pain relief was measured by a questionnaire at three months. Both techniques provided pain relief (which did not differ significantly between the two arms) but it was more sustained if a neuronavigation system was used and this system also decreased side effects.
All the reviewed procedures resulted in pain relief and some participants were then able to stop taking medications. However, many procedures tended to result in sensory side effects. All the studies in this review had flaws in their methods and all but two showed considerable risk of bias. There is little evidence from these trials to guide the person with trigeminal neuralgia as to the most effective surgical procedure. There is now an urgent need to evaluate the surgical interventions used in trigeminal neuralgia and to design robust studies; either randomised controlled trials or long-term prospective independently assessed cohort studies.
We wanted to find out if vitamin D supplementation:
• reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks;
• improves control of asthma symptoms;
• leads to any negative side effects. We searched for randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of severe asthma attacks and asthma symptom control. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods.
We also analysed whether effects of vitamin D supplementation differed according to baseline vitamin D status, the dose or form of supplements administered, how often people took the supplements, or the age of participants. We included data from 20 clinical trials in this review that involved a total of 2225 people; nine of these were included in the previous Cochrane Review on the topic and 11 were published since then. Of the 20 studies, 15 reported data on severe asthma attacks. The trials lasted between three and 40 months, and all but two investigated a particular form of vitamin D called cholecalciferol or vitamin D3. This is the most common form of vitamin D tablet.
• People given vitamin D supplements did not have a lower risk of severe asthma attacks compared to those given placebo (dummy medication).
• Vitamin D supplementation did not influence measurements of asthma control or breathing capacity; neither did it affect risk of serious harmful side effects. • People with severe asthma and those with very low vitamin D levels prior to supplementation were poorly represented, so we cannot assess whether vitamin D supplements might help these individuals.
• A single study investigating effects of calcidiol, an alternative form of vitamin D, showed a protective effect. Further investigation of this form of vitamin D is needed. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.
We included 55 randomised trials on 3121 people with asthma. There are both chemical (10 trials) and physical methods such as mattress encasings (37 trials) of reducing mite allergen levels and we included both types in this review. There were also eight trials that used both physical and chemical methods. Many trials were of poor quality and would therefore be expected to exaggerate the reported effect, but we did not find an effect of the interventions. There was no difference in peak flow (a measure of lung function), asthma symptoms and medication scores, or the number of patients reporting an improvement in their asthma symptoms.
While reducing exposure to house dust mites is recommended in guidelines, we did not find an effect of control measures to reduce the exposure to mites or their products. .
There was insufficient evidence from analysis of individual studies or across multiple scientific studies (known as meta-analysis) to confirm or refute the effectiveness of any specific agent or class of medication for the treatment of TTM in adults, children or adolescents. In adults, evidence suggests tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; a type of antidepressant) with predominantly serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI; increasing serotonin levels in the brain) actions may show a beneficial treatment effect compared to other TCAs, with reduction in TTM symptom severity. However, certainty in the estimate of effect was low and is based on a single trial comparing clomipramine with desipramine. Antipsychotics in adults may show a beneficial treatment effect and possible reduction of TTM symptom severity, with low-certainty in the estimate of effect, based on a single trial of olanzapine. Glutamate modulators (a type of amino acid modulator) in adults showed a probable beneficial treatment effect and a likely reduction in TTM symptom severity, with moderate-certainty in the estimate of effect, although based on a single trial of N-acetylcysteine (NAC; a glutamate modulator). Glutamate modulators in children and adolescents (8 to 17 years old) showed no evidence for beneficial effect in terms of the percentage of participants responding to treatment in a single study of NAC. However, evidence suggests a potential large reduction in TTM symptom severity; however, with low-certainty in the estimate. There was little to no evidence for beneficial treatment effects in terms of the percentage of participants responding to treatment or reduction of TTM symptom severity reported for antioxidants, cell signal transducers, opioid antagonists or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; a type of antidepressant) in adults, children or adolescents.
Attrition due to adverse events was only reported for SSRIs and TCAs with predominantly SRI actions in adults and for glutamate modulators in children and adolescents. Glutamate modulators had the least severe side effect profile in adults, while antipsychotics were associated with several adverse side effects, although with low-certainty in the effect estimate, and based on individual trials for each medication class. There was low-certainty evidence showing no difference in dropouts due to adverse events between the glutamate modulator group and placebo group in the single study exclusively in children and adolescents. There is some evidence that NAC (a glutamate modulator) probably demonstrates efficacy in TTM in adults and possible symptom severity reduction in children and adolescents. There is some evidence that olanzapine (an antipsychotic) and clomipramine (a TCA with predominantly SRI actions) may demonstrate efficacy in TTM in adults, although based on individual trials and therefore not generalisable to other agents in the same medication classes. Studies are few and sample sizes are small, and as a result it is not possible to draw high-quality conclusions from meta-analysis. Additional studies, with rigorous designs and appropriately powered samples are needed, particularly in children and adolescents. Future studies could also include people with common comorbidities, as the current evidence base may not be representative of clinical populations, who might have multiple medical and psychiatric conditions.
This review compared primary non-surgical interventions versus primary surgical or other treatments. Although a number of therapies have been proposed for treating central giant cell granuloma of the jaws, our review did not identify evidence from randomised controlled trials to support their use. Our review only identified one study comparing calcitonin to placebo. No significant difference in the proportion of patients with increased volume of more than 10% of the tumour compared to the pretreatment measurement at 3 months of follow-up was found between both groups.
We searched scientific databases for studies in children and adolescents with epilepsy that looked at the effects of self-management of epilepsy. We wanted to look at several outcomes to see how well people with epilepsy and their families generally cope with the condition. We included evidence published up to January 2020. This review compared seven education- or counselling-based self-management programmes for children and adolescents with epilepsy, plus one new way of delivering nursing care. Each strategy appeared to improve some of the outcomes studied, although no intervention improved all the outcomes that were measured. The studies also had problems with their methods, which made their results less reliable. Whilst none of the interventions caused any harm, their impact was limited. There is insufficient evidence to support any single strategy as the best one for children with epilepsy. The quality of the evidence was poor because all of the included studies had problems in how they were run.
Various forms of distraction from these hallucinations have been evaluated in trials, but reporting is poor, and the few studies are small and short. Although there is no evidence that they have a major effect, further trials are justified as some of these potentially simple techniques, even if their effect is negligible, could be widely implemented and prove more acceptable than other more intrusive treatments.
The review found that there is still not enough evidence on which to judge whether one type of surgical operation was better or worse than another one, or better than different types of treatment for faecal incontinence. However, many of the techniques originally reviewed are now no longer in general use.
We included eight trials with a total of 391 participants. Six trials focused on children and two on adults. The trials compared chest tube drainage (non-surgical), with or without fibrinolysis, to either VATS or thoracotomy (surgical). Two studies declared no financial conflicts of interest; the remaining six studies did not report funding source. There was no difference in the proportion of patients of all ages who survived empyema in relation to surgical or non-surgical treatment. However, this finding was based on limited data: one study reported one death with each treatment option, and seven studies reported no deaths. There was no difference in rates of complications between patients treated with surgical or non-surgical options.
There was limited evidence to suggest that VATS reduced length of stay in hospital compared to non-surgical treatments. The quality of the evidence was moderate overall. The main limitations were few included studies for each analysis and inconsistencies among studies.
The evidence is current to February 2015. We identified 25 trials, including 4121 participants with acute bacterial meningitis of which seven were performed in adults (over 16 years old), two included both children and adults and the other were performed in children. In 22 studies the corticosteroid used was dexamethasone, in three others hydrocortisone or prednisone were used. Nine studies were performed in low-income countries and 16 in high-income countries. This review found that the corticosteroid dexamethasone did not significantly reduce the death rate (17.8% versus 19.9%). Patients treated with corticosteroids had significantly lower rates of severe hearing loss (6.0% versus 9.3%), any hearing loss (13.8% versus 19.0%) and neurological sequelae (17.9% versus 21.6%).
An analysis for different bacteria causing meningitis showed that patients with meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae ) treated with corticosteroids had a lower death rate (29.9% versus 36.0%), while no effect on mortality was seen in patients with Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae ) and Neisseria meningitidis (N meningitidis) meningitis.
In high-income countries, corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss, any hearing loss and short-term neurological sequelae. There was no beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries.
Corticosteroids decreased the rate of hearing loss in children with meningitis due to H influenzae (4% versus 12%), but not in children with meningitis due to other bacteria.
Dexamethasone increased the rate of recurrent fever (28% versus 22%) but was not associated with other adverse events. Out of 25 studies, four were of high quality, 14 of medium quality and seven of low quality, leading to a moderate overall quality of evidence.
This review of trials found that using mechanical devices might be better than no treatment but the evidence is weak. There was not enough evidence to recommend any specific type of device or to show whether mechanical devices are better than other forms of treatment such as pelvic floor muscle training.
We wanted to know how effective and safe the available WHO-prequalified oral cholera vaccines made with killed bacteria were for children and adults. We searched the medical literature for trials that answered our question. We screened, collected, and analysed all relevant studies. We followed standard Cochrane methods to do this. We included five trials, with 462,754 participants, which were conducted in three different countries; Peru, India, and Bangladesh. Two doses of Dukoral, with or without a booster dose, reduced cases of cholera for two years.
Two doses of Shanchol reduced cases of cholera for five years.
One dose of Shanchol reduced cases of cholera and cases of severe dehydrating cholera for two years.
Generally, participants found that oral cholera vaccines made with killed bacteria were easy to use and safe. Side effects were similar in both the vaccine and comparison groups. We did not find any studies that examined the effects of any BivWC vaccines besides Shanchol. However, their effects on cholera bacteria are equal, so the results for Shanchol should be applicable to Euvichol and Euvichol-Plus. We searched for trials on 7 February 2023.
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials published up to June 2018. We included 10 studies at low to moderate risk of bias. All but one study were from high-income countries, mainly in developed areas of Europe. The women in the studies were either pregnant or attempting to conceive after having a miscarriage, a stillborn baby, or a serious complication in a previous pregnancy. The interventions included two types of drugs (low-dose aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin) that reduce blood clotting and may help the placenta to function (six trials), pre-conception injection of blood cells (third-party leukocyte immunisation) to help mothers' immune systems to cope with pregnancy (one trial), a special type of antibody (intravenous immunoglobulin) given into a vein to improve the functioning of the pregnant woman's immune system (two trials), and injections of a medication (progestogen) that acts like the pregnancy hormone progesterone (one trial). We evaluated data from 222 women who had previously had a stillborn baby at 20 weeks' gestation or more.
We were unable to determine whether any of these interventions reduced the chance of having another stillborn baby in the subsequent pregnancy; or whether the interventions reduced the chances of babies dying or having serious complications in the first month of life, because the studies not large enough for us to have confidence in the findings. Largely because of this, we judged the quality of evidence in this review to be very low to low. Two interventions (low-dose aspirin and third-party leukocyte immunisation) appeared to increase the birthweight of babies, but these findings are not reliable due to the small numbers of babies included.
The included studies provided very little information about psychological outcomes of parents or longer-term outcomes of children and families. There is insufficient evidence from the studies included in this review to know which interventions are helpful in preventing subsequent stillbirths and improving the health and well-being of parents and families in pregnancies that follow a stillbirth. More targeted studies are needed, which include larger numbers of women/parents who have previously experienced a stillbirth. We urgently need studies testing what forms of psychological support are most helpful in reducing anxiety and depression for these parents. Any studies carried out in future should measure the financial costs of interventions, and longer-term health outcomes of families and children.
We searched the databases until October 2014. We included 85 studies, 82 of which (10,350 participants) were eligible for quantitative analysis. The study participants were randomly selected to receive either intravenous lidocaine injection or normal saline (placebo) at the same time as the propofol injection.
We reran the search in November 2015. We found 11 potential studies of interest, those studies were added to the list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will be fully incorporated into the formal review findings when we update the review. Three out of the 85 studies were funded by either a pharmaceutical manufacturer with a commercial interest in the results of the studies or the company which supplied the propofol. Eight studies were supported by government hospital or university funds and one study was funded by a charitable grant. We found that the injection of lidocaine into a vein, either mixing lidocaine with propofol or injecting lidocaine before propofol, could effectively reduce the incidence and the high levels of pain associated with the injection of propofol. Adverse effects such as inflammation (redness, swelling) of the vein at the injection site were rare and in two studies were not more frequent with the use of lidocaine. No study reported on patient satisfaction. Based on these results we would expect that out of 1000 patients receiving intravenous propofol, about 384 who did not also receive intravenous lidocaine, would experience moderate to severe pain, compared to only 89 patients who also received intravenous lidocaine. The overall quality of evidence was high with a very large beneficial effect obtained by the administration of lidocaine to reduce painful propofol injections.
We included only studies in which chance determined whether people got a standard or extended lymph node dissection that was reported in literature up to April 29, 2019. We found only one such study that answered our review question. This study was done at 16 large hospitals in Germany and included 401 men and women with bladder cancer.
We found that having an extended node dissection may make people less likely to die for any reason or to die from bladder cancer over time, although our confidence in this result is limited.
We are uncertain whether an extended node dissection causes more serious unwanted effects than a standard lymph node dissection.
We are also uncertain whether an extended node dissection makes cancer less likely to come back over time and causes a similar risk of not-so-serious unwanted effects compared to a standard lymph node dissection. The certainty of evidence for these findings was low or very low, meaning that the true outcomes may be very different from what this review found.
We searched for evidence (17 July 2019) and identified 34 randomised controlled trials based in 16 different countries and involving > 21,500 women (mostly with low risk of complications). The trials compared a policy of inducing labour usually after 41 completed weeks of gestation (> 287 days) with a policy of waiting (expectant management).
A policy of labour induction was associated with fewer perinatal deaths (22 trials, 18,795 infants). Four perinatal deaths occurred in the labour induction policy group compared with 25 perinatal deaths in the expectant management group. Fewer stillbirths occurred in the induction group (22 trials, 18,795 infants), with two in the induction policy group and 16 in the expectant management group.
Women in the induction arms of the trials were probably less likely to have a caesarean section compared with expectant management (31 trials, 21,030 women) and there was probably little or no difference in assisted vaginal births (22 trials, 18,584 women).
Fewer babies went into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the policy of labour induction group (17 trials, 17,826 infants; high-certainty evidence). A simple test of the baby’s health (Apgar score) at five minutes was probably more favourable in the induction groups compared with expectant management (20 trials, 18,345 infants).
A policy of induction may make little or no difference to the women experiencing perineal trauma and probably makes little or no difference to the number of women having a postpartum haemorrhage, or breastfeeding at discharge. We are uncertain about the effect of induction or expectant management on the length of maternal hospital stay due to very low-certainty evidence.
For newborn babies, the number with trauma or encephalopathy were similar in the induction and expectant management groups (moderate and low-certainty evidence respectively). Neurodevelopment at childhood follow-up and postnatal depression were not reported in any of the trials. Only three trials reported some measure of maternal satisfaction. A policy of labour induction compared with expectant management is associated with fewer deaths of babies and probably fewer caesarean sections; with probably little or no difference in assisted vaginal births. The best timing of when to offer induction of labour to women at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation warrants further investigation, as does further exploration of risk profiles of women and their values and preferences. Discussing the risks of labour induction, including benefits and harms, may help women make an informed choice between induction of labour for pregnancies, particularly those continuing beyond 41 weeks, or waiting for labour to start and/or waiting before inducing labour. Women's understanding of induction, the procedures, their risks and benefits, is important in influencing their choices and satisfaction.
This review included double-blinded randomised controlled trials, and the evidence was searched for up to March 2015 using the standard Cochrane methods. The review included studies conducted for at least 12 weeks that compared the safety and effectiveness of rivastigmine compared with placebo. Thirteen studies that met these criteria were found. Most of these studies involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with an average age of around 75 years. Results from seven trials showed that patients on rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg/day by mouth, or 9.5 mg/day by skin patch) were better for three outcomes than those on placebo, after six months of treatment. The differences were quite small for cognitive function (2 points, using the ADAS-Cog which has a range of 70 points) and activities of daily living (standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.20, which is considered a small effect). Patients on rivastigmine were more likely to show overall improvement compared with those on placebo (odds ratio of 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.25 to 1.72) . However, there was no difference for behavioural changes (reported by three trials) or impact on carers (reported by one trial). Patients on rivastigmine were also about twice as likely to experience adverse events, although this risk might have been slightly less for patients using patches compared with capsules. It was possible that certain types of adverse events were less in people using patches than taking capsules (nausea, vomiting, weight loss, dizziness).
In summary, rivastigmine may be of benefit to people with Alzheimer's disease. It is possible that the using a patch is associated with reduced side effects compared to using oral capsules. The quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes reviewed was moderate. The main factors affecting our confidence in the results included relatively high number of patients dropping out in some of the trials (the rates of dropout in the rivastigmine arms were higher). There were also concerns about the applicability of the evidence for the long term treatment of Alzheimer's disease since data from double-blinded randomised controlled trials were only available for up to 12 months. All the data included in the main analysis of this review came from studies either sponsored or funded by the drug manufacturer (Novartis Pharma).
We found six small randomised controlled trials (enrolling 549 infants in total) that addressed this question. The trials generally were of good methodological quality, although study findings may be biased by the inability to blind caregivers and investigators to the type of intervention provided. These trials provided only limited evidence on the effects of the interventions on nutrition. Analysis of data from three trials revealed that infants in the percutaneous central venous catheter group needed about four fewer catheters or cannulae during hospitalisation. Combined data from all trials showed no evidence of an effect on risk of bloodstream infection. Use of central venous catheters has been thought to increase the risk of bloodstream infection in newborn infants, but this review of randomised trials found no evidence that this was the case. More trials are needed to determine which method is better for improving nutrition and growth and development in newborn infants.
The review found that this practice may not reduce pain following the operation. However, the studies included in the review had various shortcomings and further studies will be needed to allow any firm conclusions.
The evidence is current to 17 April 2018. Of the 3840 records screened, we identified only one unpublished study that met our inclusion criteria. The intervention focused on women living in Ukraine with HIV undergoing medical abortion at home. The quality of evidence was low, but found that medical abortion was successful with no major complications experienced among women living with HIV. The results from this review do not provide enough evidence to determine if differences exist in abortion outcomes for women living with HIV, but also no evidence was found showing that abortion is unsafe in this population. As it is important for all women to have access to safe abortion to combat the public health threat of high rates of maternal deaths, healthcare providers should not be deterred from providing access to safe abortion to their patients living with HIV.
The certainty of the evidence for overall and recurrence free survival was moderate. Certainty for side effects was low. This review update confirms the findings of the previous review that laparoscopy (keyhole) is an effective and viable alternative to laparotomy (open surgery) in the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer. With regards to long term survival outcomes, treatment by laparoscopy is comparable to laparotomy.
Two trials assessed whether alemtuzumab is favourable compared with no further therapy. One trial reported data on overall survival, showing a significant advantage for those patients receiving additional alemtuzumab. The time without progression was statistically significantly improved in both trials with alemtuzumab, but more patients had an infection, especially a virus infection (cytomegalovirus infection). Because of severe infections, one trial was closed prematurely.
Two trials evaluated alemtuzumab versus rituximab. Neither study reported data on survival or survival without a relapse of the disease. We found no statistically significant differences for response to therapy or for deaths during study treatment. One trial was stopped early due to an increase in mortality in the alemtuzumab arm.
In the fifth trial alemtuzumab was compared with chemotherapy (chlorambucil). In this trial no difference in survival could be detected until the last publication of the study. Alemtuzumab statistically significantly improves the survival without a relapse, the time to anti-cancer treatment for relapse, and the response rate. Again, more infections occurred in the patients treated with alemtuzumab, especially infections with the cytomegalovirus that could lead to lung and retina infections.
In summary, the currently available evidence suggests an survival advantage for alemtuzumab compared with no further therapy, but an increased risk for infections in general and for cytomegalovirus.
We wanted to find out whether there were any treatments that could reduce the need for a blood transfusion. We were interested in any medicine, or any other method that reduces additional blood loss. We also wanted to know if these treatments improved people's quality of life after surgery, or caused any unwanted effects. We searched for systematic reviews that looked at treatments to reduce blood loss in people with a broken hip. These reviews collect all the available evidence for a treatment from published studies and analyse their results. In this overview, we summarised the results of reviews and rated our confidence in the evidence that they reported. We based our judgements about our confidence on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 17 reviews about tranexamic acid and nine reviews about iron, which included 36 studies with 3923 participants. These reviews included many of the same studies; we summarised evidence from three reviews that provided the most relevant information.
For tranexamic acid, one review included 24 studies with 2148 people with a broken hip, and another included 10 studies with 1123 people. In these studies, people were given tranexamic acid before, during, or after surgery (or at all three times); it was given either directly into a person's vein, or applied onto open wounds.
For iron, one review included two studies with 403 people. The treatment was given directly into a vein either before surgery, or before and after surgery.
We found no reviews for any other types of treatment. Compared to no treatment (or a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain a medicine), tranexamic acid:
- probably reduces the need for a blood transfusion. For every 1000 people who have a hip fracture, 257 people might need a blood transfusion after receiving tranexamic acid, compared to 451 people who did not receive it;
- probably reduces the amount of transfused blood that a person is given;
- probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who have side effects from treatment (such as blood clots that develop in a deep vein), or the number of people who die within a month of breaking their hip.
Compared to no treatment (or a 'dummy' treatment), iron may make little to no difference to:
- the number of people who need to have a blood transfusion;
- the amount of transfused blood, confusion after surgery, infections, or deaths within one month.
We were not sure if receiving iron would affect people's health-related quality of life four months after surgery.
No reviews reported whether these treatments affected people's ability to carry out daily activities four months after surgery. No reviews about tranexamic acid reported information about confusion or health-related quality of life. We are only moderately confident in the evidence that tranexamic acid reduces the need for blood transfusion. The studies that provided results in our selected review may not represent all of the evidence, and this may have exaggerated the benefits of this treatment. For other outcomes, some studies were too small, reported wide differences in their results, and we could not be certain if all the studies were well-designed to give a reliable result.
We have little confidence in our findings for iron treatment, because the studies were too small to produce reliable results.
There were some flaws in the way all of the reviews came to their final conclusions, meaning that they may not have been conducted to the highest possible standard. However, the results in each review were all similar, and this meant that we were more confident that their results were accurately collected from study reports. This overview is up to date to January 2022.
In this update, we examined 722 records, and selected 26 for further evaluation. We did not find any additional studies to add to the three studies (211 participants) that were already included in the review. These studies evaluated adolescents and adults. They compared drug therapy, given to decrease uric acid, with a placebo control, in people diagnosed with hypertension. We found inconclusive results as to whether drug therapy to lower uric acid reduced blood pressure more than placebo, in people who had high blood pressure and high blood levels of uric acid. Drug therapy decreased blood levels of uric acid better than placebo. The results for side effects were inconclusive between the drug therapy and placebo groups.
There is not enough evidence to show that drugs that lower blood levels of uric acid also reduce blood pressure in people with hypertension. More research on this question is needed. Low-certainty evidence failed to establish whether drug therapy to treat high blood levels of uric acid reduces blood pressure. We reduced the certainty of the evidence because the studies presented limited data and inconsistent results for this outcome.
High-certainty evidence found that uric acid-lowering drug therapy decreases uric acid.
Low-certainty evidence failed to establish whether drug therapy increased the occurrence of side effects. We reduced the certainty of the evidence because of issues with study design, lack of data, and inconsistent results across studies.
We cannot be certain that future studies will not change these conclusions.
This review of 33 small studies (2267 participants) evaluated fusion techniques used to treat degenerative disc disease. The major treatments were discectomy (removal of the damaged disc) alone, addition of a fusion procedure (bone transplanted from another part of the body, cement, or cage), and addition of a plate.
None of the evidence from this systematic review indicates that one technique is better than another for clinically significant pain relief for patients with chronic cervical degenerative disc disease or disc herniation. The choice for a specific technique cannot be made on the most important aspect, pain relief, which was the primary outcome parameter in our review. There is moderate quality evidence that there was little or no difference in Odom’s criteria (a tool that measures the success of the surgery at relieving the symptoms that were troublesome prior to the surgery) between those who received a bone transplant from the hip and a metal cage to help with fusion.
There is moderate quality evidence that the use of a bone graft (bone transplanted from another part of the body) is more effective than discectomy alone in achieving fusion. There is low quality evidence that transplanting bone from the iliac crest is more effective in achieving fusion than using a cage, while cages are more effective in preventing complications.
Further research is very likely to have an important impact on the results and our confidence in them.
We included 14 studies that involved a total of 931 teenagers and adults. The studies investigated the effects of using laser irradiation provided by the orthodontist, vibratory devices, changing chewing patterns (patients chewing gum or wafers), brain wave music, cognitive behavioural therapy, and text messages to support people after braces were fitted. The main outcome measured was the intensity of pain over the short term as reported by patients. We found insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of the interventions, although the available low-quality evidence suggested that laser irradiation may help to control short-term orthodontic pain. None of the studies considered side effects of the treatments. We identified relatively few studies, some of which used flawed methods or were not well reported. More research to look at the possible merits of non-drug methods of pain control would be helpful. Future studies should measure pain over longer time periods and should measure side effects and costs. The quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of non-drug ways to ease orthodontic pain was low to very low, so we are not able to rely on the findings.
The evidence is current to 15 February 2017. We selected randomised controlled trials comparing influenza vaccine with placebo or no treatment in infants and children aged six months to six years, with or without a history of previous episodes of AOM. We included 11 trials involving 17,123 children. Ten out of 11 trials were funded by vaccine manufacturers. We found a 4% reduction in AOM and about an 11% reduction in the number of antibiotic prescriptions. There was no difference in the number of courses or types of vaccine administered between those who were vaccinated and those who were unvaccinated. Influenza vaccine side effects included an increase in fever, runny nose, and drowsiness. It remains uncertain whether the influenza vaccine reduced visits or admissions to healthcare facilities. Data were insufficient to show that this benefit might be balanced against more serious or rarer side effects from the vaccine.
Although we observed a reduction in antibiotic usage, this impact is uncertain because the current practice is to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Coupled with other vaccine safety concerns, the use of influenza vaccine to reduce AOM is not yet justified, and additional research is needed. The overall quality of the evidence was low to moderate.
We performed an extensive search for randomised trials comparing epinephrine alone versus epinephrine plus a second method. We found 19 clinical trials involving 2033 randomly assigned participants We found that adding a second procedure reduced the further bleeding rate and the need for emergency surgery, but the effect of this approach on death rates has not been proven. In conclusion, additional endoscopic treatment after epinephrine injection reduces further bleeding and the need for surgery in patients with high-risk bleeding peptic ulcer. Our risk of bias estimates show that the overall quality of the included studies was moderate or high. Although some studies had limitations in their design or implementation, most were clear about important quality criteria including randomisation and allocation concealment, sequence generation and blinding. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate for most outcomes. Further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the conclusions of this review.
This updated review included 20 small trials (N = 1239). We included adults (> 18 years old) with acute whiplash or non-specific neck pain as well as chronic neck pain including degenerative changes, myofascial pain or headaches that stem from the neck. No index for severity of the disorders could be specified. The evidence was current to August 2012. The results of the trials could not be pooled because they examined different populations, types and doses of electrotherapy and comparison treatments, and measured slightly different outcomes. We cannot make any definitive statements about the efficacy of electrotherapy for neck pain because of the low or very low quality of the evidence for each outcome, which in most cases was based on the results of only one trial.
For patients with acute neck pain, TENS possibly relieved pain better than electrical muscle stimulation, not as well as exercise and infrared light, and as well as manual therapy and ultrasound. There was no additional benefit when added to infrared light, hot packs and exercise, physiotherapy, or a combination of a neck collar, exercise and pain medication. For patients with acute whiplash, iontophoresis was no more effective than no treatment, interferential current, or a combination of traction, exercise and massage for relieving neck pain with headache.
For patients with chronic neck pain, TENS possibly relieved pain better than placebo and electrical muscle stimulation, not as well as exercise and infrared light, and possibly as well as manual therapy and ultrasound. Magnetic necklaces were no more effective than placebo for relieving pain; and there was no additional benefit when electrical muscle stimulation was added to either mobilisation or manipulation.
For patients with myofascial neck pain, TENS, FREMS (FREquency Modulated Neural Stimulation, a variation of TENS) and repetitive magnetic stimulation seemed to relieve pain better than placebo. About 70% of the trials were poorly conducted studies. The trials were very small, with a range of 16 to 336 participants. The data were sparse and imprecise, which suggests that results cannot be generalized to the broader population and contributes to the reduction in the quality of the evidence. Therefore, further research is very likely to change the results and our confidence in the results.
This review compared the effect of the two treatment strategies in patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis. Seven studies, with a total of 757 patients, were reviewed and provide the best available evidence. The early ERCP strategy does not reduce death or complications compared to the early conservative management strategy in patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis, regardless of the severity of the attack. However, early ERCP may be beneficial in patients who have infection of the bile duct or bile duct blockage. ERCP-related complications are infrequent.
We conducted a review of the effect of mind-body therapies for adults with fibromyalgia. After searching for all relevant studies until October 2013, we found 61 studies including 4234 adults.
- Many studies only included female participants, but some males were included in a few studies.
- Participants had mild to severe fibromyalgia.
- Mind-body interventions were compared to 'usual care', such as medication use. Secondary analysis also compared findings in comparison to an 'attention control therapy' which involved receiving information for the same amount of time as the mind-body therapy. - Low quality evidence revealed that psychological therapies improved physical functioning, pain, mood and side effects compared to usual care. More people withdrew from the psychological therapy group compared to usual care.
- There was little or no difference in physical functioning, pain and mood between people receiving biofeedback and usual care but this may have happened by chance. More people withdrew from the biofeedback than the usual care group. No studies reported any side effects.
- There was little or no difference in physical functioning, pain, mood and the number of withdrawals between people receiving mindfulness therapy and usual care. No studies reported any adverse events.
- We are uncertain whether movement therapies improve physical functioning, pain, mood, side effects or the number of people who withdrew from the treatment. There were improvements in pain and mood for people receiving movement therapies but the quality of the evidence was very low. More people withdrew and two participants reported experiencing increased pain in the intervention group.
- We are uncertain whether relaxation therapies improve physical functioning and pain compared to usual care because the quality of evidence was very low. There was little or no difference in mood and withdrawal from treatment between people receiving relaxation therapies and those receiving usual care. No adverse events were reported. The main findings on the use of psychological therapies are summarised below. People who used psychological therapies rated their physical functioning as 2 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100 compared to those who received usual care (7.5% absolute improvement). People who used psychological therapies rated their pain as 2 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100 compared to those who received usual care (3.5% absolute improvement). People who used psychological therapies rated their mood as 3 points lower on a scale of 20 to 80 compared to those who received usual care (4.8% absolute improvement). A total of 204 out of 1000 people withdrew from psychological therapies compared with 148 out of 1000 from usual care (6% absolute improvement). Nineteen people out of 1000 who received psychological therapies experienced a side effect compared with 51 out of 1000 who had usual care (4% absolute improvement). This may have happened by chance.
We do not have precise information about side effects and complications of mind-body therapies. Rare adverse events may include worsening of pain.
The results of this review demonstrate that low dose oral cyclosporine is not effective for treatment of active Crohn's disease. Studies indicate that Crohn's patients treated with low dose (5 mg/kg/day) oral cyclosporine could experience side effects including kidney problems. Therefore the use of this medication for the treatment of chronic active Crohn's disease is not advisable. Higher oral doses and injections of cyclosporine have not been sufficiently evaluated. Larger doses of cyclosporine are not likely to be useful for the long-term management of Crohn's disease due to the risk of kidney damage and the availability of other proven medications.
The evidence is current to October 2013. We found and analyzed five randomized trials including 7134 adult participants with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, 40-80 years old, who received treatment aimed to lower blood pressure to a standard compared to a lower blood pressure target and followed for 2 to 5 years to detect differences in mortality and adverse events. Four out of five studies were funded by the drug manufacturer, which had a potential of impacting the results. One study was sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) from the United States. The only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' systolic blood pressure was a small reduction in the incidence of stroke, but with a significantly larger increase in the number of other serious adverse events. The effect of systolic blood pressure targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk. There was no benefit associated with a 'lower' diastolic blood pressure target.
The evidence from randomized trials available at the present time is of low quality and does not support blood pressure targets lower than the standard in people with raised blood pressure and diabetes. Further research is likely to change these results and future studies should report all outcomes that are important to patients, such as mortality and adverse events.
Included studies assessed a range of treatments, which they compared with placebos (an identical but inactive treatment), no treatment, other treatment, vehicle (inactive ingredient(s) which help deliver an active treatment), or textile without the anti-S.aureus component.
Studies were conducted worldwide, and included males and females. Twelve studies recruited children; four, adults; 19, both; and six were unclear; where reported, the average participant age ranged from 1.1 to 34.6 years. Eczema severity varied from mild to severe. Treatment durations ranged from 10 minutes to 3 months; total study durations, from 15 weeks to 27 months. Outcomes were measured from treatment start. We classed outcomes as short-term when treatment duration was less than four weeks, and long-term when treatment was given for more than four weeks.
People may be more likely to experience slightly increased short-term improvement with topical steroid/antibiotic combinations than with steroid only (low-quality evidence, one study of infected eczema and two studies with unspecified infection). There is probably little or no difference between the combination group and the steroid only groups in short-term impact on quality of life (QoL) (moderate-quality evidence, one study of infected children). Antibiotic resistance was similar between groups in the long term, but we are uncertain of this result due to very low-quality evidence (one study of infected children).
When compared to placebo, oral antibiotics may make no difference to short-term improvement (low-quality evidence, two studies: one in uninfected infants and children; the other in mainly infected infants and children). For short-term QoL, there is probably little or no difference between the groups (moderate-quality evidence, one study of infected infants and children). Short-term antibiotic resistance was similar in both groups, but we are uncertain if there is a true difference as the quality of evidence was very low (two studies of infants and children, infected in one study and uninfected in the other).
Bleach baths may make no difference to short-term improvement when compared to placebo (low-quality evidence, one study of uninfected participants). There is also probably little or no difference in short-term QoL in children of unspecified infective status (one study; moderate-quality evidence); based on the same study, we are uncertain if short-term antibiotic resistance was different between groups (very low-quality evidence).
Side effects bad enough to stop treatment were rare in all studies; however, evidence was very low quality in all three comparisons, so we are uncertain whether there is a difference between groups. Assessment ranged from six days to two months, participants included children and adults with mixed infective status, and causes of withdrawal included worsening of eczema or itch and loose stools.
Participants in the topical steroid/antibiotic combination group experienced fewer minor side effects than those given steroids alone. Comparing oral antibiotics to placebo, participants experienced equally low numbers of minor side effects. However, we are uncertain if their are true differences between groups due to very low-quality evidence. Based on short-term assessment of mixed participants (children and adults, with mixed infective status), reported side effects included sickness, diarrhoea, stomach/joint pains, and itching. For bleach baths versus placebo, some long-term minor side effects (burning/stinging, dry skin) were reported in both groups, so there may be no difference between treatment groups (low-quality evidence, uninfected participants (2 to 30 years)). Evidence quality for improvement in symptoms or signs was low; for improvement in QoL, moderate; for antibiotic resistance, very low; and for side effects, it was almost consistently very low. The studies were small, diverse, and at risk of bias.
We searched the scientific literature worldwide up to June 2016 for research studies of drug treatments for children with RAP. We found 16 studies that met our criteria, examining antidepressants, antibiotics, antihistamines, antispasmodics, a dopamine receptor antagonist, and a hormone treatment. Fourteen studies compared drug treatments to a placebo, and two to usual medical care. The trials were carried out in seven countries: seven in the USA, four in Iran, one in the UK, one in Switzerland, one in Turkey, one in Sri Lanka, and one in India. The studies included a total of 1024 children aged between five and 18 years. All children were recruited from outpatient clinics. Follow-up lasted between two weeks and four months. This review suggests there is no evidence for the use of medications to improve symptoms or the child's quality of life. Consequently, if medications are prescribed, this should be done within a well-conducted clinical trial. If a medication is prescribed to a child with RAP, it must be remembered that RAP varies with time, and therefore any improvement or worsening may due to the natural history of the condition rather than a medication response. Many of the studies had some weaknesses in their design and how they were reported, therefore the overall quality of the evidence for medications in RAP is low. The studies with better methods included few children and have not been reproduced by other researchers since.
These drugs were highly effective in animal studies. Individual clinical trials in stroke patients did not confirm benefit for any of the drugs, however. This review confirms that there are no overall benefits for these drugs in stroke, although only two of them have been tested in a large enough population to be reasonably confident that they have no major effects. Some drugs may be harmful. Over 11,000 patients have participated in trials of 13 different drugs that inhibit glutamate release or binding, but two-thirds of all data are from trials of just two drugs. For most drugs in this class, trials have been too small to provide conclusive evidence of harm or benefit. Major differences among individual drugs mean that it is impossible to conclude that all drugs with this mode of action are ineffective. Further trials remain justified, and several are ongoing.
We included 23 trials with 2656 people who either had a stent or not. Whether they received a stent or not was decided by chance. A stent may make people come back to the hospital for problems less often, but we are very uncertain of this finding. Pain on the day of surgery and on days one to three after surgery may be similar. People with a stent may have more pain in the long term (days four to 30), but we are also very uncertain about this. The need for another procedure may be similar.
People with a stent may be less likely to need narcotics (strong pain medications that can cause addiction), but we are very uncertain about this. There may be no difference in the risk of a urinary tract infection. Stenting may make people a little less likely to develop a narrowing of the ureter because of scarring and may make them slightly less likely to be admitted to the hospital. However, we are very uncertain of both findings. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low depending on the outcome, meaning that we have moderate, low, or very low confidence in the study results.
This updated review includes 51 trials: 18 trials contrasted manipulation or mobilisation against no treatment or pretend treatment; 34 trials compared manipulation or mobilisation against another treatment (electrotherapy, exercise, medication) and various techniques or dosages. [Note one trial included two comparison groups]. Although other reviews focusing on adverse events suggest that mobilisation is safe and manipulation may result in rare but serious side effects such as stroke, disc herniation or serious neurological deficits, our review noted temporary and benign side effects with both approaches; more than half of the included trials did not report on adverse effects.
• Manipulation or mobilisation versus inactive treatment: For subacute/chronic neck pain, a single manipulation produced temporary pain relief. However, conflicting evidence was found at short-term follow-up for pain reduction with multiple sessions. At short-term and intermediate-term follow-up, multiple sessions of thoracic manipulation were favoured for pain reduction among participants with acute/subacute neck pain, and for functional improvement among those with acute to chronic neck pain. No additional pain relief was reported when thoracic mobilisation was used.
• Manipulation or mobilisation versus another active treatment: Cervical manipulation produced changes in pain, function, quality of life, global perceived effect and patient satisfaction that were comparable with those attained with cervical mobilisation up to intermediate-term follow-up for patients with neck pain of any duration. Cervical manipulation for acute/subacute neck pain was more effective than varied combinations of analgesics, muscle relaxants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for improving pain and function at up to long-term follow-up. For chronic cervicogenic headache, cervical manipulation provided greater benefit than light massage in improving pain and function at short-term and intermediate-term follow-up. For chronic CGH, cervical manipulation may be superior to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in improving pain at short-term follow-up. For acute neck pain, cervical manipulation may be more effective than thoracic manipulation in improving pain and function up to intermediate-term follow-up. Finally, for subacute and chronic neck pain, cervical mobilisation appeared similar to pulsed ultrasound, TENS, acupuncture and massage in improving pain, function, quality of life and patient satisfaction up to intermediate-term follow-up. However, combining laser with manipulation may be superior to using manipulation or laser alone. No high-quality evidence was found, so uncertainty about the effectiveness of mobilisation or manipulation for neck pain remains. Future research is likely to have an important impact on the effect estimate. Authors of this review encountered many challenges, for example, the number of participants in most trials was small, 80% (41/51) of the included studies were of low or very low quality and evidence on the optimum dosage requirement was limited.
We wanted to compare all the currently available treatments for varicose veins to find out which is best in terms of:
- short- and long-term technical success (whether the treatment fully destroys the vein, or stops blood from pooling in the legs, or both);
- stopping varicose veins from returning (recurrence);
- avoiding unwanted effects; and
- improving people’s well-being. We searched for studies that compared treatments for varicose veins in men and women of any age.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 24 studies that involved 5135 people with mild to severe varicose veins. The studies followed people for between 5 weeks to 8 years after their treatment. The majority of the people in the studies were women.
The studies took place in private and public clinics and hospitals in 10 different countries: Austria, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the USA.
The studies we found did not investigate all possible treatments for varicose veins, especially newer treatments. Technical success
Most treatments are equally likely to fully destroy the vein or prevent blood pooling in the legs, or both. However:
- heat-based endovenous treatment with a laser may be more successful than traditional surgery;
- both heat-based laser treatment and surgery may be more successful than chemical-based endovenous treatment with a foam chemical.
Recurrence rates
Most treatments were similarly successful at stopping varicose veins from recurring.
Heat-based radio wave endovenous treatment may be better than both laser endovenous treatment and surgery at preventing varicose veins from recurring in the longer term.
Unwanted effects
Unwanted effects were generally low for all treatments. The studies reported very few serious unwanted effects requiring treatment, both in the short and long term.
Well-being
People in the studies said they had improved well-being regardless of the treatment they received. Our confidence in the evidence ranges from moderate to very low because of:
- concerns over how the studies were carried out (people in most of the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, as were the researchers assessing treatment data, which could affect the studies’ results);
- similar studies did not get the same results; and
- only a small number of studies contributed data to each result.
We were not able to reach firm conclusions about which of the treatments compared is best. This Cochrane Review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to November 2020
The aim of this review is to compare the efficacy of the various forms of drug treatment that have been used to treat psychotic depression. We did this by analysing all randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Twelve RCTs met our inclusion criteria. These trials involved a total of 929 people.
From these trials, we found evidence that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic provides more effective treatment for psychotic depression than either treatment alone. However, our confidence in this conclusion is limited because the information came from only a small number of RCTs, which included small numbers of people. In addition, the types of people involved varied between RCTs, and these trials differed in design, which means that we cannot confidently generalise their findings.
Only two small randomised clinical trials on this topic were identified. The trials were not large enough in terms of sample size or length of follow up to allow changes in mortality to be adequately evaluated. Glucocorticosteroids were associated with improvement in serum markers of inflammation and liver histology, both of which were of uncertain clinical significance. Glucocorticosteroids were also associated with adverse events, including reduced bone mineral density. Further trials are necessary if the effectiveness of glucocorticosteroids is to be properly evaluated.
Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review of existing studies, which includes evidence current up to 8 March 2013. This review includes 13 published studies in which a total of 417 children and adults randomly received different tooth preparations before fixed orthodontic braces were bonded to their teeth. Eleven of these studies compared SEPs with conventional etching, and two compared two different SEPs. Only five of the studies provided usable evidence for this review and the combined results did not enable a conclusion to be made about whether or not there is a difference in bond failure (when the orthodontic fixings come away from the tooth) between SEPs and conventional etching. There was also no usable evidence to suggest whether SEPs or conventional etchants lead to less decay around the etching site, or are associated with fewer costs or better participant satisfaction. There was also no usable evidence to enable conclusions to be drawn about which was the best SEP, acid, concentration or etching time. The evidence presented is of low quality due to issues with the way in which some of the studies were conducted.
We searched the medical literature for studies done in hospitals and communities that evaluated infections and deaths in newborns randomly assigned to receive either chlorhexidine care or the standard practice. Searches were done up to November 2013. There were 12 relevant studies found: there were seven hospital-based and five community-based studies. In four studies maternal vaginal wash with chlorhexidine was done in addition to neonatal skin and cord care. The durations of the included studies ranged from 6 months to 37 months. The number of participants in the included studies ranged from 112 to 29,760. None of the included studies declared any conflict of interest or were funded by pharmaceutical companies.  Chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to dry cord care may lead to no difference in neonatal mortality. However, chlorhexidine cord cleansing probably reduces the risk of omphalitis or infections.
Chlorhexidine skin cleansing compared to dry cord care may lead to no difference in omphalitis or infections (none of the studies in this comparison reported effects of the treatments on neonatal mortality). Chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to dry cord care reduces neonatal mortality and omphalitis or infections. There was no difference between chlorhexidine skin cleansing and usual skin care on neonatal mortality (none of the studies in this comparison reported effects of the treatments on omphalitis or infections). Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no probably leads to no difference in neonatal mortality and infections. Maternal vaginal cleansing in addition to total body cleansing increases the risk of hypothermia. Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no intervention may lead to no difference in neonatal mortality. Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no intervention probably reduces the risk of neonatal infections (none of the studies included in this comparison reported effects on omphalitis). The confidence in estimate of effect (quality of evidence) for the effects of chlorhexidine on neonatal mortality and omphalitis or infections were varied (low, moderate and high). Main reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence were poorly conducted studies and lack of enough data.
We found 13 randomised controlled trials (four more than in the previous version), evaluating 2775 couples, that compared regular ICSI with IMSI for assisted reproduction. These studies were funded by fertility centres and universities. Based on the very low-quality evidence that we found, we are uncertain of the benefit of IMSI over ICSI. The chance of having a live birth with IMSI was between 20% and 32%, compared to 25% with ICSI. For women with a 7% risk of miscarriage with regular ICSI, the risk with IMSI was between 5% and 10%. The clinical pregnancy rate with IMSI was between 35% and 44%, compared with 32% with ICSI. We downgraded the quality of the evidence because of limitations in the included studies (risk of bias), inconsistency of the observed effect across studies, and high risk of publication bias. There was no evidence concerning congenital abnormalities. We conclude that the current evidence is very limited for suggesting using IMSI instead of ICSI in clinical practice.
Eleven trials were included in this review, ten comparing vitamin A with a control (placebo or no supplementation) and one comparing different vitamin A regimens. The search for eligible trials was updated in May 2016. Compared to the control group, supplementing very low birth weight infants with vitamin A appears to have a small benefit in reducing the risk of death or oxygen requirement at one month of age and the risk of chronic lung disease (oxygen requirement) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (moderate-quality evidence). There was a marginal reduction of the combined outcome of death or chronic lung disease (moderate-quality evidence). Although there is a statistical reduction in chronic lung disease, these findings are consistent with either a meaningful impact on chronic lung disease or a negligible impact. The one trial that investigated neurodevelopmental status at 18 to 22 months of age correcting for prematurity found no evidence of benefit or harm associated with vitamin A supplementation compared to control (low-quality evidence). No adverse effects of vitamin A supplementation were reported, but it was noted that intramuscular injections of vitamin A were painful. Whether clinicians decide to utilise repeat intramuscular doses of vitamin A to prevent chronic lung disease may depend upon the local incidence of this outcome and the value attached to achieving a modest reduction in the outcome balanced against the lack of other proven benefits and the acceptability of the treatment. Information on long-term neurodevelopmental status suggests no evidence of either benefit or harm from the intervention.
This review looked at trials studying one of the groups of medications known as bisphosphonates which are more typically used to treat osteoporosis. They are used in osteogenesis imperfecta to try and reduce the number of bone fractures in affected individuals.
We included 14 trials, and most of these did not show a major reduction in fractures in affected individuals when treated with bisphosphonates. Each trial independently showed significant improvements in bone mineral density after treatment with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. Bone pain, growth and quality of life indicators were not reported in enough detail and the effects of this treatment need further investigation. The long-term effectiveness and safety of bisphosphates, as well as dose and duration of therapy, require extended evaluation The majority of trials analysed were small and not powered to show a statistically significant difference in many outcome measures.
We searched for evidence in August 2017 and have now included 11 studies involving 9475 women. Three studies looked at using a partograph versus no partograph, seven studies looked at different partograph designs, and one study looked at using a partograph versus a new labour scale. It is uncertain whether using a partograph has any effect on the number of women having a caesarean section or babies born with low Apgar scores (a score which measures the physical condition of the newborn, with a low score indicating poor condition) because the quality of evidence is very low. Using a partograph may make little or no difference to length of labour (low-quality evidence), or the number of women who receive oxytocin to speed up their labour (moderate-quality evidence). When compared to a four-hour action line, women in the two-hour action line group were more likely to have their labour speeded up using oxytocin. There was no clear difference between women in the two- and four-hour action line groups in having caesarean sections, the lengths of first stage of labour, maternal experiences of childbirth, or low Apgar scores.
When we compared a two-hour action line with a three-hour action line, fewer women reported negative childbirth experiences in the two-hour action line group. When we compared the three- and four-hour action line groups, the caesarean section rate was higher in the three-hour action line group. There were no clear differences between the two-, three-, or four-hour action line groups in any of the other outcomes measured. The caesarean section rate was lower in the alert line only group. There were no clear differences between groups for oxytocin augmentation, low Apgar score, instrumental vaginal birth, and perinatal death. When we compared a partograph with the latent phase (including early stages of labour) and one without the latent phase, the caesarean section and oxytocin augmentation rates were higher in the partograph with a latent phase. There were no clear differences between groups for oxytocin augmentation, and Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes. When we compared a partograph with a two-hour action line and a stepped dystocia line, fewer women received oxytocin augmentation in the dystocia line group. We did not observe any clear differences in any of the other primary outcomes in this comparison. The labour scale compared with the partograph resulted in fewer women receiving oxytocin augmentation, but did not produce any clear difference for any of the other primary outcomes. On the basis of the findings of this review, we cannot be certain of the effects of routine use of the partograph as part of standard labour care, or of the different partograph designs. Further trial evidence is required to establish the efficacy of partograph use per se and its optimum design.
Trials comparing ipratropium bromide versus beta-agonists showed no significant difference in short-term or long-term effects (24 hours) on ease of breathing. Side effects of these drugs were reported by only a minority of patients and include dry mouth and tremor, and a 'strange feeling' after drug administration.
The effect of hormone treatment on viral myocarditis remains controversial. The review authors conducted a thorough search of the medical literature. Eight randomised trials with 719 patients which met the inclusion criteria compared hormone treatment plus conventional therapy with no hormone. Hormone treatment did not reduce mortality from viral myocarditis. Improvements in heart function were found but the trials were of low quality and small size so this finding must be regarded as uncertain. Further trials comparing hormone treatment in people suffering viral myocarditis with placebo are warranted. There are no conflicts of interest in the review.
This systematic review identified two randomised clinical trials with very small numbers of participants. One of the trials was a pilot trial and compared simvastatin with placebo, and the other trial assessed atorvastatin versus fenofibrate versus a combination of the two. The small pilot trial (n = 16 patients) assessing simvastatin versus placebo in NASH patients did not show significant effects on liver enzyme activities or liver histology. No adverse events were reported. The other trial compared atorvastatin versus fenofibrate versus a group receiving both interventions in 186 patients with NAFLD. There were no statistically significant differences between any of the three intervention groups regarding the 54 week mean activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, or alkaline phosphatases (liver enzymes) in the blood. The triglyceride levels seemed higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group. Liver histology was not assessed in this trial. The presence of biochemical and ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD seemed higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the other two intervention groups. Three patients discontinued treatment due to myalgia and elevated serum creatine kinase activity, one from the atorvastatin group and two from the combination group. Another patient from the atorvastatin group discontinued treatment due to raised alanine aminotransferase activity, over three times the upper normal limit. Both trials were at high risk of bias (that is, overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms). Furthermore, the groups were small raising the risks of random errors (that is, play of chance). Accordingly, we did not find evidence to support or refute the use of statins for patients with NAFLD or NASH. Further unbiased trials with larger numbers of patients looking explicitly at patient-related outcomes of interest (for example, quality of life, development of cirrhosis, and mortality) are needed to assess the effects of statins on NAFLD or NASH.
Twenty-six trials were included in this systematic review involving 12,422 hospitalised adults in 25 parallel group trials, and 27,878 adults in one large cluster-randomised cross-over trial.The review of evidence from trials found that although antiseptic-coated (silver alloy) catheters reduced the number of bacteria in the urine, they did not reduce the number of UTIs caused by the presence of the catheter. Catheters coated with antimicrobials (antibiotics, nitrofurazone) designed to kill or stop the growth of bacteria may reduce both the number of bacteria in the urine as well as number of people having UTI caused by the presence of the catheter. However, the evidence is relatively weak, and any benefit is likely to be small and hence unlikely to be meaningful to either patients or clinicians. These antibiotic catheters are also more likely to cause discomfort for patients compared with standard catheters, and they are more expensive. The best approaches to reducing the risk of UTI include reducing the numbers of unnecessary catheterisations, or reducing the time period during which the catheter is used by removing it as early as possible.
Currently, no evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests that beta blockers adversely affect walking distance in people with intermittent claudication, and beta blockers should be used with caution, if clinically indicated. The review authors identified six randomised controlled trials that involved a total of only 119 people with mild to moderate peripheral arterial disease. The beta blockers studied were propranolol, pindolol, atenolol and metoprolol. None of the trials showed clear worsening effects of beta blockers on time to claudication, claudication distance and maximal walking distance as measured on a treadmill, nor on calf blood flow, calf vascular resistance and skin temperature, when compared with placebo. Trial investigators reported no adverse events or issues regarding taking the beta blockers studied.
Most of the trials were over 20 years old and reported findings between 1980 and 1991. All were small and of poor quality. The drugs were administered over a short time (10 days to two months), and most of the outcome measures were reported in single studies. Additional drugs－calcium channel blockers and combined alpha and beta blockers－were given during some of the trials.
This systematic review of four studies (total of 40 participants) found insufficient evidence of benefit for any of the three classes of medications included in this review. There is a considerable lack of evidence to address pharmacological interventions for anxiety disorders in patients with COPD. We recommend that new research be conducted to ascertain the best mode of treatment for anxiety within this population. This new research needs to be of good methodological design, investigate an adequate number of patients and have a meaningful length of follow-up.
we collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found one study enrolling 76 babies, of whom 69 met eligibility for this review. This review is up-to-date as of 20 August 2021. there is not enough evidence for or against tubes with a cuff to prevent airway problems. Newborn babies who have a tube with a cuff may require less frequent replacement of the tube for any reason and less frequent replacement of the tube to find the correct size than babies who had a tube without a cuff. we judged the reliability of the evidence to be very low. This is because only a few babies were in a single trial and there was possible bias. There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants.
Our review, based on fourteen small trials, evaluating different macronutrient supplements, found limited evidence that balanced macronutrient formulas increase protein and energy intake. However, we found no evidence that such supplementation translates into reductions in disease progression or HIV-related complications, such as opportunistic infections or death.
We wanted to find out if antibiotics improve the pain and swelling reported by adults with toothache caused by symptomatic apical periodontitis or apical abscess. We were interested in the effects of antibiotics when they were given with or without dental treatment and with or without painkillers. We searched for studies that looked at antibiotics compared to dummy medication (placebo) in adults with these conditions. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size. We found three studies (one of which was new for this update). In total, we included 134 participants in the analysis. All studies were conducted in university dental schools and evaluated the use of oral (taken by mouth) antibiotics in the reduction of pain reported by adults after having total or partial chemo-mechanical debridement under local anaesthetic (injection of a numbing medicine into the gum around the affected tooth). In one trial, participants received a single dose of antibiotics before their dental treatment. In two trials, participants received a seven-day course of antibiotics after their dental treatment.
In the study comparing a single dose of oral antibiotics versus placebo before complete root canal treatment, there were no differences in pain or swelling reported by participants in the two groups. The evidence suggests a single dose of antibiotics results in little to no difference in pain and swelling when taken before root canal treatment.
The two studies comparing a course of antibiotics versus placebo after partial or total chemo-mechanical debridement found there were no differences in pain or swelling between the groups. However, the evidence is very uncertain.
No study examined the effect of antibiotics on their own without surgical dental treatment.
Two studies reported side effects among participants. One person who received the placebo medication had diarrhoea (loose stools). One person who received antibiotics after dental treatment experienced tiredness and reduced energy after their treatment and another who received antibiotics before dental treatment experienced dizziness. Our confidence in the evidence relating to a single-dose of antibiotics taken before complete root canal treatment is low because we have very serious concerns that the study may not have included a sufficient number of participants to detect a difference between the groups and we cannot exclude the possibility of a beneficial effect.
We are not confident in the evidence about the effect of a course of antibiotics taken after partial or total chemo-mechanical debridement because the studies were small and, in one of the studies, many participants dropped out before the end. The evidence was up to date to 25 November 2022.
We found 16 studies that randomly assigned 26,795 patients 60 years or older with high blood pressure to antihypertensive drug therapy or to placebo or untreated control for a mean duration of 4.5 years. Blood pressure-lowering drug therapy in people with hypertension 60 years and older reduced death, strokes, and heart attacks. Benefit was similar if both upper and lower blood pressure numbers were elevated and if only the upper number was elevated. First-line treatment used in most studies was a thiazide. More patients withdrew from the studies owing to side effects of these drugs. The magnitude of benefit in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity observed was probably greater among 60- to 79-year-old patients than in very elderly patients 80 years or older. Blood pressure-lowering drug treatment for healthy persons (60 years or older) with raised blood pressure reduces death, heart attacks, and strokes. Review authors graded the quality of evidence as high for reduction in death and as moderate for reduction in stroke and heart attacks.
