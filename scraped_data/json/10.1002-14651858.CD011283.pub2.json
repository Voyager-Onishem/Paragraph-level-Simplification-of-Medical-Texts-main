      "text": "We included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 2929 participants comparing processed EEG or EP indices-guided anaesthesia with clinical signs-guided anaesthesia. There are five ongoing studies and one study awaiting classification.\nAnaesthesia administration guided by the indices from a processed EEG (bispectral index) probably reduces the risk of POD within seven days after surgery with risk ratio (RR) of 0.71 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 17, 95% CI 11 to 34; 2197 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate quality of evidence). Three trials also showed the lower rate of POCD at 12 weeks after surgery (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.96; NNTB 38, 95% CI 21 to 289; 2051 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but it is uncertain whether processed EEG indices reduce POCD at one week (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; 3 trials; 1989 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and at 52 weeks (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.80; 1 trial; 59 participants; very low quality of evidence). There may be little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.64; 1 trial; 1155 participants; low-quality evidence). One trial suggested a lower risk of any postoperative complications with processed EEG (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; 902 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no effect on reduced postoperative length of stay (mean difference −0.2 days, 95% CI −2.02 to 1.62; 1155 participants; low-quality evidence)."

      "text": "There is moderate-quality evidence that optimized anaesthesia guided by processed EEG indices could reduce the risk of postoperative delirium in patients aged 60 years or over undergoing non-cardiac surgical and non-neurosurgical procedures. We found moderate-quality evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction at three months could be reduced in these patients. The effect on POCD at one week and over one year after surgery is uncertain. There are no data available for patients under 60 years. Further blinded randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate strategies for the amelioration of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and their consequences such as dementia (including Alzheimer's disease (AD)) in both non-elderly (below 60 years) and elderly (60 years or over) adult patients. The one study awaiting classification and five ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed."

      "text": "Background\nPostoperative delirium (POD) is a disturbed state of mind which occurs a few days after surgery. POD involves a fluctuating course of confusion and disorganized behaviour. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a decline in the ability of a person to think clearly after an operation. This may persist for weeks or months. POCD can affect a person's concentration, attention, memory, learning, and the speed of their movement and mental responses. POD and POCD can complicate the quality of a person's recovery from anaesthesia, as well as the quality of their life after surgery.\nProcessed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors generate numerical values of brain electrical activity. The number provides information about the depth of anaesthesia during surgery, and is used to guide the dose of anaesthetic given. This is to prevent someone receiving either too small or too large a dose of anaesthetics."

An RCT is a study (or trial) which aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. The people taking part in the trial are randomly allocated to either the group receiving the treatment under investigation, or to a group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment) as the control. RCTs provide the most reliable evidence."

Results from three studies (2051 participants) indicate that this could also reduce the incidence of POCD at three months from 9.1% to 6.4%."

We found some moderate-quality evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction at three months could be reduced in these participants. There is insufficient evidence supporting the effect on POCD at one week and over one year after surgery or in younger patients."
