This review examined the effect of inhaled anti-cholinergic drugs in children with non-specific cough. Currently there is no evidence to support the use of inhaled anti-cholinergics as no randomised-controlled trials of inhaled anti-cholinergic medications in the management of prolonged non-specific cough in children were found."
