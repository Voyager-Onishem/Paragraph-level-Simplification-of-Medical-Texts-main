      "text": "Of 1777 potential studies evaluated, only two Randomized Control Trials (123 patients) were included. ß-interferon treatment compared to placebo did not show differences regarding the proportion of patients with progression of the disease (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.55 to1.43), and it was associated with a greater frequency of treatment-related adverse events (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.45-2.48). One of the trials evaluated the MRI secondary outcome pre-specified in the protocol. This trial showed that at two years the numbers of active lesions on brain MRI scan in ß-interferon arm were significantly lower than in placebo arm (weighted mean difference -1.3, 95% CI -2.15 to -0.45, P = 0.003); also, the number of participants with active lesions was significantly higher in placebo arm vs. ß-interferon arm at two years (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86, P = 0.02)."

Based on this review, the included studies showed that ß-interferon treatment was not associated with reduced disability progression in PPMS patients. However, the trial population was too small to allow definitive conclusions on the efficacy of ß-interferon therapy in PPMS patients. Larger research studies need to be done in patients with PPMS in order to clarify whether ß-interferon is effective in this population."

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006643.pub2).\nTreatments of patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis ( PPMS) with interferon beta ( INF beta) seems not associated with a reduction of  the disability progression\nTo date there is no proven or licensed disease-modifying treatments to slow the progression of PPMS. Studies on the effects of INF beta have mainly focused on Relapsing-Remitting MS and have demonstrated a modest reduction on the progression of the disease.  The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of INF beta in  patients with PPMS.\nAmong the pertinent medical literature only  two studies, comprising  a total of 123 participants,  met the criteria of the methodological quality necessary for their inclusion in this review. Taking into account  the disability progression, the analysis of the data showed that INF beta treatment in  patients with PPMS was  not associated with a reduction of  this parameter during the first two years of therapy. Adverse effects, mainly flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions, occurred frequently and were the same as  reported by the many studies on   IFN beta treatments in MS patients with different types of the disease.\nIt is worth nothing that the patients’ population analysed was too small to allow a definitive conclusion on the efficacy of IFN beta therapy  in PPMS."
