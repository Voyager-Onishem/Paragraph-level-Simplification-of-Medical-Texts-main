      "text": "In HIV-infected adults, oral ulcers occur more frequently, last longer and produce more painful symptoms than in immunocompetent people. Oral aphthous ulcers observed during the course of HIV infection may be severe and can result in significant morbidity in these patients. Such manifestations may interfere with oral functions and alter patients' quality of life."

  "pls": "Oral aphthous ulcers associated with HIV infection occur commonly and recur frequently with varying severity. They occur at different stages of the disease. Topical treatments aim at meeting the basic requirements of the management of these ulcers which include pain relief, healing and reduction in recurrence. Topical treatment reduces the incidence of toxicity and serious side effects associated with systemic treatments. This review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the various topical agents available for the treatment of HIV related oral aphthous ulcers. From all the abstracts and articles examined, only two studies appeared to meet the inclusion criteria but had no full text reports, which makes it impossible to make recommendations."
