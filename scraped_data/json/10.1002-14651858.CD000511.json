      "text": "All nine of the included studies note an initial improvement in respiratory status and a decrease in the risk of RDS in infants who receive prophylactic animal derived surfactant extract. The meta-analysis supports a decrease in the risk of pneumothorax (typical relative risk 0.40, 95% CI 0.29, 0.54; typical risk difference -0.12, 95% CI -0.16, -0.09), a decrease in the risk pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) (typical relative risk 0.46, 95% CI 0.36, 0.59; typical risk difference -0.16, 95% CI -0.21, -0.11), a decrease in the risk of neonatal mortality (typical relative risk 0.60, 95% CI 0.47, 0.77; typical risk difference -0.07, 95% CI -0.12, -0.03), and a decrease in the risk of BPD or death (typical relative risk 0.80, 95% CI 0.72, 0.88; typical risk difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.16, -0.04). No differences are reported in the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis or retinopathy of prematurity. Few data are available on long-term follow-up of treated infants."

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is caused by a lack of, or dysfunction in, surfactant, the chemicals that line the lung air spaces and help keep the lung expanded. A variety of animal derived and synthetic surfactants have been formulated and are given to babies at risk to prevent them developing RDS. The review found that animal derived surfactant given at birth lowers rates of death and many serious and disabling conditions for babies at risk of RDS."
