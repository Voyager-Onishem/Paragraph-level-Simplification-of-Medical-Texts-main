      "text": "Male factors leading to subfertility account for at least half of all cases of subfertility worldwide. Although some causes of male subfertility are treatable, treatment of idiopathic male factor subfertility remains empirical. Researchers have used gonadotrophins to improve sperm parameters in idiopathic male factor subfertility with the ultimate goal of increasing birth and pregnancy rates, but results have been conflicting."

No significant difference between groups was noted when intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) was performed. None of the included studies reported miscarriage rates, and adverse events data were sparse."

Large multi-centre trials with adequate numbers of participants are needed."

  "pls": "Background\nMale subfertility contributes to at least 50% of subfertility in couples. Around 39% of subfertile men have idiopathic subfertility (male subfertility with an unknown cause or origin). Gonadotrophins (hormones that stimulate sperm production) have been used in the treatment of men with this condition, but results have been inconsistent. We reviewed the evidence.\nStudy characteristics\nWe found six randomised controlled trials, with 456 participants.\nKey results\nThere was a trend towards an increase in live birth and pregnancy rates during and within three months of gonadotrophin treatment. The quality of the evidence was very low. We did not find enough studies to allow final conclusions about the use of gonadotrophins in the treatment of men with idiopathic male factor subfertility. The quality of the evidence was very low. More studies on this subject are needed. The evidence is current to January 2013."
