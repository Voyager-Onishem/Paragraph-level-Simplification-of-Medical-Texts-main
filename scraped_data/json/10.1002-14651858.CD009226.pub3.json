      "text": "Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is the most frequent extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease, affecting up to 50% of patients. It has a great impact on quality of life. Rituximab (RTX) is a human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 receptor on B-lymphocytes. Preliminary work has shown that blocking this CD20 receptor with RTX may affect the clinical course of TAO by reducing inflammation and the degree of proptosis."

Two review authors independently scanned titles and abstracts, and screened full-text reports of potentially relevant studies. The outcomes of interest in this review were: clinical activity score (CAS), NOSPECS severity scale, proptosis (mm), palpebral aperture (mm), extraocular motility (degrees or diplopia rating scale), quality of life and adverse effects."

      "text": "We identified two studies that met the inclusion criteria in this updated review. Across both studies, the mean age of participants was 55 years and 77% were women.\nRTX compared to intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP)\nOne study, conducted in Italy, compared RTX (n = 15 after one participant withdrew) with IVMP (n = 16) for active TAO (CAS ≥ 3 out of 7 or 4 out of 10). We judged this study to be at low risk of bias in most domains, but it was stopped early because of disease reactivation in the comparator group (5/16 participants). This study provided low-certainty evidence that RTX may result in CAS improvement at 24 weeks compared to IVMP (15/15 versus 12/16 improved by ≥ 2 points; risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.78). Only very low-certainty evidence was available for the other outcomes: NOSPECS improvement by 2 or more classes (3/15 versus 3/16; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.25 to 4.49); proptosis improvement by 2 mm or more (0/15 versus 1/16; RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.08); palpebral aperture improvement by 3 mm or more (2/15 versus 0/16; RR 5.31, 95% CI 0.28 to 102.38); motility improvement by 1 class or more (3/15 versus 3/16; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.25 to 4.49); and improvement on the Graves’ ophthalmopathy QoL scale by at least 6 points for \"functioning\" (5/14 versus 8/13; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.32), and “appearance” (9/14 versus 6/13; RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.82). Adverse events were more common in the RTX group (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.13; low-certainty evidence). Minor adverse effects (mild infusion reactions) were observed in most people receiving RTX at first infusion. Two participants experienced a major infusion reaction, likely cytokine release syndrome.\nRTX compared to placebo\nOne study, conducted in the USA, enrolled 25 participants with active TAO (CAS ≥ 4 out of 7), comparing RTX (13 participants) to placebo. We judged this study to be at low risk of bias in most domains, but it was stopped early due to recruitment issues. It provided very low-certainty evidence on the following outcomes at 24 weeks: CAS improvement by 2 or more points (4/13 RTX versus 3/12 placebo; RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.40); NOSPECS improvement by 2 or more classes (2/13 versus 2/12; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.15 to 5.56); proptosis improvement by 2 mm or more (2/13 versus 4/12; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.08); palpebral aperture median change (0 mm in RTX group, in both eyes separately, versus -0.5 mm and 0.5 mm in placebo group right and left eye, respectively); motility median diplopia score (3 versus 2.5); SF-12 physical component median score (45.9 versus 40.3) and mental component median score (52.8 versus 46.1). More participants in the RTX group experienced adverse effects (8/13 versus 3/12; RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.84 to 7.18)."

      "text": "Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy is an eye disease that affects half of people that have Graves' disease, a condition where the body's immune system attacks the thyroid gland and makes it overactive. In thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy the body's immune system also attacks the tissues surrounding the eyes. Symptoms include eye pain, redness, swelling, eye protrusion (proptosis), double vision, and in severe cases, reduction in vision."

      "heading": "How is thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy treated?",
      "text": "Treatment options for severe thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy include anti-inflammation medicines called steroids, and radiotherapy.  However, relapses are common. Surgery to relieve the pressure that builds up behind the eye (orbital decompression) is usually reserved for sight-threatening cases.\nA possible alternative treatment is a medicine called rituximab, given as an intravenous infusion (injection into the vein), which aims to stop the body’s defence system (immune system) from mistakenly attacking its healthy tissues and causing inflammation."

Everyone taking part in the study was aged 18 to 80 years (average age 55 years) and 77% were women. One study (31 people) compared intravenous rituximab (2 x 1000 mg infusions given 2 weeks apart or a single infusion of 500 mg) to intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid). The other study (25 people) compared intravenous rituximab (2 x 1000 mg infusions given 2 weeks apart) to intravenous placebo (dummy) infusions. As the studies compared rituximab to different alternative treatments, it was not possible to combine the studies' results to analyse them together."

      "text": "The evidence suggests that rituximab, compared to intravenous methylprednisolone, may result in an improvement in how 'active' the thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy is at 24 weeks following treatment when measured using one particular scale, but the evidence for whether there was a true difference was uncertain. Furthermore, there was little to no difference when thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy activity was measured using a different scale. There was no evidence of a difference in the following outcomes, measured at 24 weeks following treatment:\n- reduction in eye protrusion\n- reduction in how wide open the eyelids are\n- improvement in eye movement and double vision\n- improvement in quality of life\nThe evidence suggests that rituximab, compared to placebo, results in little to no difference in any of the outcomes outlined above, measured at 24 weeks following treatment.\nThe number of adverse events was higher for rituximab compared to both intravenous methylprednisolone and placebo, but the evidence for whether there was a true difference was uncertain."
