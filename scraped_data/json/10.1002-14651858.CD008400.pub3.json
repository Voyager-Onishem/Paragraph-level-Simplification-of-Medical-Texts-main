      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "Acupuncture has been used to treat children with mumps for hundreds of years in China. Benefits attributed to acupuncture include decreased swelling and pain, and shortening of the disease duration. According to traditional Chinese medicine, health is achieved by maintaining an uninterrupted flow of Qi, or energy, along 14 meridians. Mumps is caused by 'wind warmth evil' (epidemic heat) and 'pyretic toxicity' accumulated in the Shaoyang and Yangming meridians, thus the flow of Qi, sputum and 'heat evil' stagnate in and around the ears and the cheeks. Acupuncture can help expel 'wind warmth evil', clear pathogenic heat, remove toxic substances, act as an anti-inflammatory, alleviate pain and re-establish the normal flow of Qi, thus restoring internal balance."

      "text": "This update aimed to systematically review all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for children with mumps. The evidence is current to December 2014. Although acupuncture has been widely used in China for children with mumps and quite a number of trials claiming to be RCTs have been published, we identified noÂ eligible trials. Although no trials were included, we reviewed the studies we found and there were no reports of adverse events with acupuncture as a treatment for children with mumps. Therefore, we cannot draw any definite conclusions about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for children with mumps."
