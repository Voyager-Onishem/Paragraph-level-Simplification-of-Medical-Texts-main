We also searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, the reference lists of retried articles and clinical trials, and the authors' personal files."

      "text": "We used the standardized methods of Cochrane Neonatal for conducting a systematic review and for assessing the methodological quality of studies (neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html). The titles and the abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy were independently assessed by the two review authors and full text versions were obtained for assessment if necessary. Forms were designed to record trial inclusion/exclusion and data extraction. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence."

      "text": "Newborn babies, especially those born preterm, are at risk from infections in the blood (sepsis), gastrointestinal inflammation and injury (necrotizing enterocolitis), or both these conditions. A number of babies with sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis die or suffer from long-term brain and lung damage, despite treatment with antibiotics. Lactoferrin, a substance normally present in human milk, may be effective against infections and gastrointestinal injury."

      "heading": "Key results",
      "text": "We did not find any studies on lactoferrin supplementation with antibiotics in treating babies with sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. It is unlikely that lactoferrin will be used for treatment of infection or intestinal inflammation in preterm babies because it has not been found effective to prevent these illnesses. During infection and intestinal problems feeds are usually not given. We do not recommend studies be done in the future to address this issue."
