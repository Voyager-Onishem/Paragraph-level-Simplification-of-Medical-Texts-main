      "text": "Adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence in women with oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen also increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) causes profound endometrial suppression. This systematic review considered the evidence that the LNG-IUS prevents the development of endometrial pathology in women taking tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer."

The primary outcome measure was endometrial pathology (including polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer), diagnosed at hysteroscopy or endometrial biopsy. Secondary outcome measures included fibroids, abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting, breast cancer recurrence, and breast cancer-related deaths. We rated the overall certainty of evidence using GRADE methods."

      "text": "We included four RCTs (543 women analysed) in this review. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be moderate for all of the outcomes, due to imprecision (i.e. limited sample sizes and low event rates). In the included studies, the active treatment arm was the 20 μg/day LNG-IUS plus endometrial surveillance; the control arm was endometrial surveillance alone.\nIn tamoxifen users, the LNG-IUS probably reduces the incidence of endometrial polyps compared to the control group over both a 12-month period (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.64, I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, n = 212; moderate-certainty evidence) and over a long-term follow-up period (24 to 60 months) (Peto OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.39; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs, n = 417; moderate-certainty evidence). For long-term follow-up, this suggests that if the incidence of endometrial polyps following endometrial surveillance alone is assumed to be 23.5%, the incidence following LNG-IUS with endometrial surveillance would be between 3.8% and 10.7%.\nThe LNG-IUS probably slightly reduces the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia compared with controls over a long-term follow-up period (24 to 60 months) (Peto OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.67; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs, n = 417; moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of endometrial hyperplasia following endometrial surveillance alone is assumed to be 2.8%, the chance following LNG-IUS with endometrial surveillance would be between 0.1% and 1.9%. However, it should be noted that there were only six cases of endometrial hyperplasia.\nThere was insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion regarding the incidence of endometrial cancer in tamoxifen users, as no studies reported cases of endometrial cancer.\nAt 12 months of follow-up, the LNG-IUS probably increases abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting compared to the control group (Peto OR 7.26, 95% CI 3.37 to 15.66; I² = 0%; 3 RCTs, n = 376; moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting following endometrial surveillance alone is assumed to be 1.7%, the chance following LNG-IUS with endometrial surveillance would be between 5.6% and 21.5%. By 24 months of follow-up, abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting occurs less frequently than at 12 months of follow-up, but is still more common in the LNG-IUS group than the control group (Peto OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.04 to 7.10; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, n = 233; moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting following endometrial surveillance alone is assumed to be 4.2%, the chance following LNG-IUS with endometrial surveillance would be between 4.4% and 23.9%. By 60 months of follow-up, there were no cases of abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting in either group.\nThe numbers of events for the following outcomes were low: fibroids (n = 13), breast cancer recurrence (n = 18), and breast cancer-related deaths (n = 16). As a result, there is probably little or no difference in these outcomes between the LNG-IUS treatment group and the control group."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "The LNG-IUS probably slightly reduces the incidence of benign endometrial polyps and endometrial hyperplasia in women with breast cancer taking tamoxifen. At 12 and 24 months of follow-up, the LNG-IUS probably increases abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting among women in the treatment group compared to those in the control. Data were lacking on whether the LNG-IUS prevents endometrial cancer in these women. There is no clear evidence from the available RCTs that the LNG-IUS affects the risk of breast cancer recurrence or breast cancer-related deaths. Larger studies are necessary to assess the effects of the LNG-IUS on the incidence of endometrial cancer, and to determine whether the LNG-IUS might have an impact on the risk of secondary breast cancer events."

      "text": "Tamoxifen is commonly used by women to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Tamoxifen can also cause abnormal changes to the lining of the uterus (endometrium), including polyps and cancer. The LNG-IUS is a uterine device that releases the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel into the endometrium and causes marked endometrial suppression. As levonorgestrel is a progestin, and many breast cancers are progesterone-sensitive, it is important to study the safety of the LNG-IUS in breast cancer survivors."

      "text": "This review suggests that the LNG-IUS probably slightly reduces the risk of endometrial polyps and endometrial hyperplasia over two to five years in women taking tamoxifen following breast cancer. The evidence suggests that if the incidence of endometrial polyps following endometrial surveillance alone is assumed to be 23.5%, the incidence following LNG-IUS plus endometrial surveillance would be between 3.8% and 10.7%. Evidence also suggests that if 2.8% of women who only had endometrial surveillance developed endometrial hyperplasia, the chance following LNG-IUS plus endometrial surveillance would be between 0.1% and 1.9%.\nThe LNG-IUS probably increases abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting. After one year, the evidence suggests that if the incidence of abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting following endometrial surveillance alone is assumed to be 1.7%, the incidence following LNG-IUS plus endometrial surveillance would be between 5.6% and 21.5%. After two years, if 4.2% of women who only had endometrial surveillance experienced abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting, between 4.4% and 23.9% of women who had both surveillance and LNG-IUS would be expected to experience this. However by five years of follow-up, no women in either group reported abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting.\nWe found insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion regarding the effect on incidence of endometrial cancer (a cancer originating in glandular tissue), fibroids, breast cancer recurrence, or breast cancer-related death."
