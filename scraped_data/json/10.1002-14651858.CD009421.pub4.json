      "text": "For people with cystic fibrosis and advanced pulmonary damage, lung transplantation is an available and viable option. However, graft rejection is an important potential consequence after lung transplantation. Immunosuppressive therapy is needed to prevent episodes of graft rejection and thus subsequently reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. There are a number of classes of immunosuppressive drugs which act on different components of the immune system. There is considerable variability in the use of immunosuppressive agents after lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis. While much of the research in immunosuppressive drug therapy has focused on the general population of lung transplant recipients, little is known about the comparative effectiveness and safety of these agents in people with cystic fibrosis. This is the final update of a previously published review; no longer being updated due to a lack of research in the area."

      "text": "The lack of currently available evidence makes it impossible to draw conclusions about the comparative efficacy and safety of the various immunosuppressive drugs among people with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation. A 2013 Cochrane Review comparing tacrolimus with cyclosporine in all lung transplant recipients (not restricted to those with cystic fibrosis) reported no significant difference in mortality and risk of acute rejection. However, tacrolimus use was associated with lower risk of broncholitis obliterans syndrome and arterial hypertension and higher risk of diabetes mellitus. It should be noted that this wider review contained only a small number of included studies (n = 3) with a high risk of bias. Additional randomised studies are required to provide evidence for the benefit and safety of the use of immunosuppressive therapy among people with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation."

      "text": "Lung transplantation is an available and realistic treatment option for people with cystic fibrosis whose lungs are severely damaged. However, as a natural defence mechanism, the body recognises a transplanted lung as foreign and activates the immune system to reject it. This is known as graft rejection. To prevent this, drugs are needed to suppress the immune system after lung transplantation. There are several different types of such drugs that act by suppressing different components of the immune system. Much of the research on such drugs has focused on all people who have had a lung transplant and not specifically on those with cystic fibrosis. Currently, clinicians do not all agree on a common way of using anti-rejection drugs in people with cystic fibrosis after they have received a lung transplant."

We contacted the researchers who conducted these studies, but they have not sent us the specific results we need.\nThere is a review of drugs to suppress the immune systems of people who have had lung transplants (not restricted to those with cystic fibrosis) and this only included three studies which the review authors judged to have a high risk of bias. The review did not find that any one drug was better than another for reducing the chances of death or acute rejection; but one drug (tacrolimus) led to a lower risk of long-term rejection and high blood pressure, although there was a higher risk of diabetes.\nResearch is needed on the use of drugs that suppress the immune system in people with cystic fibrosis who have received a lung transplant. Due to the lack of research in this area, we do not plan to update this review again."
