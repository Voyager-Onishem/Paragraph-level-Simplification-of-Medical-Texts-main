One treatment known by its tailored design is the McKenzie method (e.g. an individualized program of exercises based on clinical clues observed during assessment)."

Three trials received financial support from non-commercial funders and two did not provide information on funding sources. All trials were at high risk of performance and detection bias. None of the included trials measured adverse events.\nMcKenzie method versus minimal intervention (educational booklet; McKenzie method as a supplement to other intervention - main comparison)\nThere is low-certainty evidence that the McKenzie method may result in a slight reduction in pain in the short term (MD -7.30, 95% CI -12.04 to -2.56; 2 trials, 328 participants) but not in the intermediate term (MD -5.00, 95% CI -14.29 to 4.29; 1 trial, 180 participants).\nThere is low-certainty evidence that the McKenzie method may not reduce disability in the short term (MD -2.74, 95% CI -7.52 to 2.04; 2 trials, 328 participants) nor in the intermediate term (MD -0.87, 95% CI -7.31 to 5.57; 1 trial, 180 participants).\nMcKenzie method versus manual therapy\nThere is low-certainty evidence that the McKenzie method may not reduce pain in the short term (MD -8.67, 95% CI -27.37 to 10.02; 3 trials, 298 participants) and may result in a slight increase in pain in the intermediate term (MD 7.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 13.30; 1 trial, 235 participants).\nThere is low-certainty evidence that the McKenzie method may not reduce disability in the short term (MD -4.98, 95% CI -15.00 to 5.04; 3 trials, 298 participants) nor in the intermediate term (MD 4.30, 95% CI -0.72 to 9.32; 1 trial, 235 participants).\nMcKenzie method versus other interventions (massage and advice)\nThere is very low-certainty evidence that the McKenzie method may not reduce disability in the short term (MD 4.00, 95% CI -15.44 to 23.44; 1 trial, 30 participants) nor in the intermediate term (MD 10.00, 95% CI -8.95 to 28.95; 1 trial, 25 participants)."

      "text": "Non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) is the most common type of back pain and consists of pain or discomfort in the lower back that is not caused by an identifiable disease or problem (e.g. fracture, cancer, infection, nerve root pain, etc.). NSLBP is considered (sub)acute when it lasts for up to 12 weeks."

      "heading": "What is the McKenzie method?",
      "text": "The McKenzie method is a treatment applied by trained healthcare providers (typically physiotherapists) for the care of people with NSLBP. It comprises an individualized program of exercises based on clinical clues (changes in pain location or restricted movement), observed during the assessment. It also includes the teaching of postures and home exercises to encourage people to control their symptoms by themselves."

We were interested in knowing if the McKenzie method could reduce pain and disability in the short term (closest to two weeks) and in the intermediate term (closest to three months). We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes."

      "text": "We found five studies on a total of 536 people. Two studies compared the McKenzie method to minimal intervention, three compared it to manual therapy, (i.e. hands-on therapy provided by a clinician) and one compared it to other interventions (back massage and advice). All five studies were conducted in high-income countries (three in the USA, one in Australia, and one in Scotland). Three of them were funded by non-commercial sources and two did not provide information on funding sources.\nOur main comparison of the McKenzie method versus minimal intervention found that the McKenzie method may result in a slight reduction in pain and disability (0- to 100-point scale, lower scores mean less pain and less disability):\n- Pain: improved by 7.30 points (12.04 better to 2.56 better) in the short term (2 trials, 328 participants); and improved by 5.00 points (14.29 better to 4.29 worse) in the intermediate term (1 trial, 180 participants).\n- Disability: improved by 2.74 points (7.52 better to 2.04 worse) in the short term (2 trials, 328 participants); and improved by 0.87 points (7.31 better to 5.57 worse) in the intermediate term (1 trial, 180 participants).\nOur second comparison of the McKenzie method versus manual therapy found that the McKenzie method may not reduce pain or disability (0- to 100-point scale, lower scores mean less pain and less disability):\n- Pain: improved by 8.67 points (27.37 better to 10.02 worse) in the short term (3 trials, 298 participants); and worsened by 7.00 points (0.70 worse to 13.30 worse) in the intermediate term (1 trial, 235 participants).\n- Disability: improved by 4.98 points (15.00 better to 5.04 worse) in the short term (3 trials, 298 participants); and worsened by 4.30 points (0.72 better to 9.32 worse) in the intermediate term (1 trial, 235 participants).\nOur third comparison of the McKenzie method versus other interventions (back massage and advice) found that the McKenzie method may not reduce disability (0- to 100-point scale, lower scores mean less disability):\n- Disability: worsened by 4.00 points (15.44 better to 23.44 worse) in the short term (1 trial, 30 participants); and worsened by 10.0 points (8.95 better to 28.95 worse) in the intermediate term (1 trial, 25 participants).\nNone of the trials included in the review measured unwanted effects."
