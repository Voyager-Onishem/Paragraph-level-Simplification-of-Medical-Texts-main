In these infants, prophylactic use of indomethacin, a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, has demonstrated short-term clinical benefits. The effect of indomethacin in preterm infants with a symptomatic PDA remains unexplored."

We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: failure of PDA closure within one week of administration of the first dose of indomethacin; bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days' postnatal age and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age; proportion of infants requiring surgical ligation or transcatheter occlusion; all-cause neonatal mortality; necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (â‰¥ Bell stage 2); and mucocutaneous or gastrointestinal bleeding."

      "text": "We included 14 RCTs (880 preterm infants). Four out of the 14 included studies were judged to have high risk of bias in one or more domains. Indomethacin administration was associated with a large reduction in failure of PDA closure within one week of administration of the first dose (risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.38; risk difference (RD) -0.52, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.45; 10 studies, 654 infants; high-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in the incidence of BPD (BPD defined as supplemental oxygen need at 28 days' postnatal age: RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.51; 1 study, 55 infants; low-certainty evidence; BPD defined as supplemental oxygen need at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.55; 1 study, 92 infants; low-certainty evidence) and probably little to no difference in mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.33; 8 studies, 314 infants; moderate-certainty evidence) with use of indomethacin for symptomatic PDA. No differences were demonstrated in the need for surgical PDA ligation (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.29; 7 studies, 275 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), in NEC (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.55; 2 studies, 147 infants; low-certainty evidence), or in mucocutaneous or gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.58; 2 studies, 119 infants; low-certainty evidence) with use of indomethacin compared to placebo or no treatment. Certainty of evidence for BPD, surgical PDA ligation, NEC, and mucocutaneous or gastrointestinal bleeding was downgraded for very serious or serious imprecision."

      "text": "This review of 14 clinical trials (880 infants) found that indomethacin is very effective in closing a PDA, reducing the risk of PDA being open at one week by 70%, when compared to no treatment or placebo. Of the 14 total studies, eight reported on death, which was not different between groups. Only one study reported on the number of infants needing oxygen at 28 days of life, and only one study reported on the number of infants using oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (how many weeks pregnancy plus how long the infant has been alive). Data are not adequate to permit conclusions on these outcomes. Both studies showed no difference between those who received indomethacin or no treatment or placebo. Medication side effects or other adverse effects (such as gut bleeding, kidney injury, and bowel infection/lack of blood flow called necrotizing enterocolitis) were not different between groups."

      "heading": "Certainty of evidence",
      "text": "According to GRADE (a method used to score the certainty of trials supporting each outcome), high-certainty evidence shows that indomethacin is effective in closing a PDA in a preterm infant with symptoms. However, there is not enough evidence to say if indomethacin helps to reduce death or lung injury. Also, there is not enough evidence to say if indomethacin causes increased harm compared to no treatment or placebo. More studies are needed to see if indomethacin can reduce death or lung injury in infants with symptomatic PDA."
