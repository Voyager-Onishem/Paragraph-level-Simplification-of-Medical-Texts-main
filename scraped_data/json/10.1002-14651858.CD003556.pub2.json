      "text": "Six RCTs of debridement were identified: four assessed hydrogels, with an additional study evaluating larval therapy against hydrogel and one evaluated surgical debridement. Pooling the three RCTs which compared hydrogel with gauze or standard care suggested that hydrogels are significantly more effective in healing diabetic foot ulcers (Relative Risk 1.84, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)1.3 to 2.61). Surgical debridement showed no significant benefit over standard treatment. One small trial, available in abstract form only, suggested that larvae resulted in a greater reduction in wound area compared with hydrogel, but this evidence has not been confirmed by publication of full trial results. Other debridement methods such as enzyme preparations or polysaccharide beads have not been evaluated in diabetic foot ulcers."

    {
      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "There is evidence to suggest that hydrogel increases the healing rate of diabetic foot ulcers compared with gauze dressings or standard care. There is insufficient evidence (one small trial, abstract only) of the effects of larval therapy on diabetic foot ulcers. More research is needed to evaluate the effects of a range of widely used debridement methods and of debridement per se."

  "pls": "People with diabetes often develop foot ulcers (open sores on the feet that go through the skin), which are a serious complication and can themselves result in serious consequences such as amputation. Cleaning and removing dead tissue and callus from the ulcers is a common procedure also know as \"debridement\" and can be done in several ways, including surgery and special dressings and gels (such as hydrogels). The review found that hydrogel results in faster healing than gauze or standard care. The evidence for other debriding strategies is unclear."
