      "text": "We included 16 trials. All 13 prevention trials involved military recruits undergoing training. Participants of two of the three treatment trials were military personnel. \n\nTen prevention trials tested the effects of various foot inserts and other footwear modifications. While pooling of data was not possible, the four trials evaluating the use of \"shock-absorbing\" boot inserts versus control found fewer stress injuries of the bone in their intervention groups. However, the only trial showing a significant benefit lacked important information about trial design. A key issue in several trials was the acceptability, in terms of practicality and comfort, of the boot inserts. Two cluster-randomised prevention trials found no significant effect of leg muscle stretching during warm up before exercise.\nPooled data from three small but very different trials testing the use of pneumatic braces in the rehabilitation of tibial stress fractures showed a significant reduction in the time to recommencing full activity (weighted mean difference -33.39 days, 95% confidence interval -44.18 to -22.59 days). These results were highly heterogeneous (I squared = 90%), which is likely to reflect the underlying differences of the trials, including differences in the control group interventions and definitions of outcomes."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "The use of shock absorbing inserts in footwear probably reduces the incidence of stress fractures in military personnel. There is insufficient evidence to determine the best design of such inserts but comfort and tolerability should be considered.\nRehabilitation after tibial stress fracture may be aided by the use of pneumatic bracing but more evidence is required to confirm this."

  "pls": "Stress fractures are a type of overuse injury. They can be very painful and debilitating. Lower limb stress fractures are common in people undergoing military training and in athletes, particularly long distance runners. Measures to prevent stress fractures include modifications to footwear and changes to training schedules. We found some evidence that shock absorbing boot inserts help prevent stress fractures during military training. It is not clear what is the best design to use. Treatment of stress fractures generally involves a long period of activity restriction. We found some evidence that pneumatic braces may speed recovery of tibial stress fracture."
