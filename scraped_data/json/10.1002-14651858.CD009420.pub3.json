There are several drugs which can be used to treat these symptoms, known as antiemetics. Levomepromazine is an antipsychotic drug is commonly used as an antiemetic to alleviate nausea and vomiting in palliative care settings."

      "heading": "Data collection and analysis",
      "text": "We assessed the potential relevance of studies based on titles and abstracts. We obtained copies of any study reports that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria for further assessment. At least two review authors read each paper to determine suitability for inclusion and discussed discrepancies in order to achieve a consensus."

    {
      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "In the original review, we identified 421 abstracts using the search strategy. We considered eight studies for inclusion but ultimately excluded them all from the review. We updated the search in February 2015 and identified 35 abstracts, but again none met the inclusion criteria. We identified two trials from clinical trial registers, one of which is ongoing and one of which was closed due to poor recruitment."

    {
      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "As in the initial review, we identified no published randomised controlled trials examining the use of levomepromazine for the management of nausea and vomiting in adults receiving palliative care, and our conclusion (that further studies of levomepromazine and other antiemetic agents are needed to provide better evidence for their use in this setting) remains unchanged. We did, however, identify one ongoing study that we hope will contribute to the evidence base for this intervention in future updates of this review."

  "pls": "This is an update of the review published in 2013. Nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting (being sick) are common and unpleasant symptoms that are often experienced by people with advanced disease. There are several different drug therapies which are available to treat these symptoms, known as antiemetics. Levomepromazine was originally used to treat schizophrenia but is also used to control nausea and vomiting. It can be given as a tablet or as an injection.\nIn February 2015, we were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials investigating whether levomepromazine is an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting in patients receiving palliative care.\nThere is a need for randomised studies to find out which drugs are the most effective treatments for nausea and vomiting in these patients. In the updated review we identified one ongoing study which aims to assess how well levomepromazine improves nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer."
