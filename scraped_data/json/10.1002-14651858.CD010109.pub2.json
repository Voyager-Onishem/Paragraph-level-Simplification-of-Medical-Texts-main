      "text": "At present, there is a lack of effective treatments for paraquat poisoning. Xuebijing injection is a complex traditional Chinese prescription consisting of Flos Carthami , Radix Paeoniae Rubra , Rhizoma Chuanxiong , Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae and Radix Angelicae Sinensis. Although clinical experience suggests that Xuebijing injection might have potential in the management of paraquat poisoning, there is no conclusion on the effectiveness of this treatment."

      "text": "We identified two trials including 84 people. Although there were fewer deaths in people treated with Xuebijing injection, meta-analysis showed that it did not provide a statistically significant benefit in reducing all-cause mortality in people with paraquat poisoning as compared to control (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.04; P = 0.08)."

    {
      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Based on the findings of two small RCTs, Xuebijing injection did not have a statistically significant benefit on reducing all-cause mortality in people with paraquat poisoning. However, both included studies involved small numbers of participants and were considered to be of poor methodological quality. The results are imprecise and easily compatible with the play of chance. Xuebijing injection may be effective for people with paraquat poisoning; however, this needs to be proven by further high-quality evidence."

This review aimed to assess the effects of Xuebijing injection in people with paraquat poisoning. We identified two trials including 84 people.

Xuebijing injection may be effective for people with paraquat poisoning, but the effects need to be proven by more high quality evidence."
