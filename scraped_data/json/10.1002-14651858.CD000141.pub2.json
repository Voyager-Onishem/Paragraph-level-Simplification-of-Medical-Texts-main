Soll; E. Ã–zek). For this update additional data were sought on pulmonary hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, neurodevelopmental follow-up, rehospitalization for pulmonary reasons,and reactive airway disease. Data were analyzed according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group."

      "text": "Three trials were identified that met study criteria. Two studies were randomized controlled trials of multiple vs. single dose animal derived surfactant extract in infants with established respiratory distress syndrome. Meta-analysis of these trials suggests a reduction in the risk of pneumothorax (typical relative risk 0.51, 95% CI 0.30, 0.88; typical risk difference-0.09, 95% CI -0.15, -0.02) and a trend towards a reduction in the risk of mortality (typical relative risk 0.63, 95% CI 0.39, 1.02; typical risk difference -0.07, 95% CI -0.14, 00.00).\nOne study of multiple vs. single dose synthetic surfactant in infants at high risk of respiratory distress syndrome was identified. This study reported a decrease in NEC (relative risk 0.20, 95% CI 0.08, 0.51; risk difference-0.05, 95% CI -0.07, -0.02) and mortality (relative risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.39, 0.81; risk difference-0.07, 95% CI -0.12, -0.03)\nNo data on long-term neurological or pulmonary outcome were reported.\nNo complications associated with multiple dose treatment were reported in the identified trials."

      "text": "In infants with established respiratory distress, a policy of multiple doses of animal derived surfactant extract resulted in greater improvements regarding oxygenation and ventilatory requirements, a decreased risk of pneumothorax and a trend toward improved survival.\nIn infants at high risk of respiratory distress, a policy of multiple doses of synthetic surfactant resulted in greater improvements regarding oxygenation and ventilatory requirements, a decreased risk of NEC and decreased mortality.\nThe ability to give multiple doses of surfactant to infants with ongoing respiratory insufficiency leads to improved clinical outcome and appears to be the most effective treatment policy."

  "pls": "Multiple doses of surfactant have more benefit than a single dose.\nSurfactant is essential to normal lung function in babies. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is caused by a lack of, or dysfunction in, surfactant. A variety of surfactants (ranging for synthetic to animal derived) have been manufactured and are given to babies at risk for or having RDS. This review of trials found that multiple doses, rather than a single dose, further improved babies' outcomes. Multiple doses decreased the need for mechanical ventilation (machine-assisted breathing). In trials using animal derived surfactant in babies with RDS, multiple dose treatment lowered the risk of lung complications and there was a trend towards lowering the risk of death as well. In infants at high risk of respiratory distress, a policy of multiple doses of synthetic surfactant resulted in greater improvements regarding oxygenation and ventilatory requirements, a decreased risk of intestinal injury (necrotizing enterocolitis) and decreased mortality."
