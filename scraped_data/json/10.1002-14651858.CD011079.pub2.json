      "text": "Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) delivers humidified gas at increased flow rates via binasal prongs and is becoming widely accepted as a method of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. While indications for the use of (HHFNC) and its associated risks and benefits are being investigated, the best strategy for the discontinuation of HHFNC remains unknown. At what point an infant is considered stable enough to attempt to start withdrawing their HHFNC is not known. The criteria for a failed attempt at HHFNC discontinuation is also unclear."

Research is required into the best strategy for withdrawal of HHFNC and to which subgroups this applies. Clear criteria for the definition of stability prior to attempting to withdraw HHFNC needs to be established. Furthermore, clear definitions are needed as to what constitutes failure of HHFNC."

      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) is a form of respiratory support used in the treatment of preterm infants. Potential risks of HHFNC include damage to the nose and leaking of air from the lungs. Infants on HHFNC require more nursing care and the use of extra equipment (when compared to not being on any support). However, potential complications of removing HHFNC from babies too early include increased episodes of forgetting to breathe, increased oxygen needs, increased effort of breathing, the need to restart HHFNC, and the need for a breathing tube with mechanical ventilation. Any of these complications can be seen as a \"failure\" and are potentially distressing to staff and family. The best way to withdraw HHFNC once it has been started is unknown. Options include simply stopping, weaning the flow, increasing the time off HHFNC each day, or combinations of both."
