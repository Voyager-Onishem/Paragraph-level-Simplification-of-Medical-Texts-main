      "text": "Four randomised trials were identified. Three trials (including 477 infants) of adequate methodology met the eligibility criteria. There was reduced risk of catheter occlusion (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.67; and NNT 9, 95% CI 6 to 20). There was no statistically significant difference in the duration of catheter patency; however, in one study survival analyses identified benefit with heparin (adjusted hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.36, 0.83). This could be due to higher incidence of elective removal of catheters in neonates at the completion of therapy in the heparin group in that study (63% vs. 42%; p = 0.002). There was no statistically significant differences in the risk of thrombosis (typical RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.51), catheter related sepsis (typical RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.57), or extension of intraventricular haemorrhage (typical RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.28) between the two groups."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Prophylactic use of heparin for peripherally placed PCVC allows a greater number of infants to complete their intended use (complete therapy) by reducing occlusion. Evidence from this systematic review support the prophylactic use of heparin for PCVC in neonates. None of these studies was powered to evaluate a lower incidence rate of adverse events. If this therapy is adopted in routine practice, monitoring of side effects is indicated."

  "pls": "There is now evidence to show beneficial effect of heparin for preventing complications when used with central catheters to give access to the tiny veins of premature and critically ill babies\nCritically ill or premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) often need medication and feeding through their veins. These veins are small and fragile so repeated injections can be hard and painful for the baby. A central catheter is a small tube that can be inserted into the vein, allowing medications and other liquids to be given to the baby for a prolonged period. It can get dislodged, blocked or infected. The drug heparin allows to complete intended therapy in more patients without increasing complications of bleeding or allergic reactions. The review found that there was now evidence to show benefit of heparin. If it is used routinely, careful monitoring of side effects is warranted."
