      "text": "This is the second update of this systematic review. High blood pressure represents a major public health problem. Worldwide, approximately one-fourth of the adult population has hypertension. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a link between hyperuricaemia and hypertension. Hyperuricaemia affects 25% to 40% of those with untreated hypertension; a much lower prevalence has been reported in those with normotension or in the general population. However, whether lowering serum uric acid (UA) might lower blood pressure (BP), is an unanswered question."

We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), enrolling 211 people with hypertension or prehypertension, plus hyperuricaemia.\nLow-certainty evidence from three RCTs found inconclusive results between those who received UA-lowering drugs and placebo, in 24-hour ambulatory systolic (MD -6.2 mmHg, 95% CI -12.8 to 0.5) or diastolic BP (-3.9 mmHg, 95% CI -9.2 to 1.4).\nLow-certainty evidence from two RCTs found that UA-lowering drugs reduced clinic-measured systolic BP (-8.43 mmHg, 95% CI -15.24 to -1.62) but results for clinic-measured diastolic BP were inconclusive (-6.45 mmHg, 95% CI -13.60 to 0.70).\nHigh-certainty evidence from three RCTs found that serum UA levels were reduced by 3.1 mg/dL (95% CI 2.4 to 3.8) in the participants that received UA-lowering drugs.\nLow-certainty evidence from three RCTs found inconclusive results regarding the occurrence of adverse events between those who received UA-lowering drugs and placebo (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.43 to 8.10)."

      "text": "This is the second update of this Cochrane Review. The evidence is current to May 2020.\nUric acid is the natural end product of the breakdown of the body's tissues and a person's food, particularly protein. Uric acid is usually removed from the blood by the kidneys, and removed from the body in the urine. If too much uric acid is produced, or the kidneys are not able to remove it from the blood, uric acid levels in the blood increase (termed hyperuricaemia). A link between hyperuricaemia and high blood pressure (hypertension) has been recognized since the 19th century. This review aims to evaluate whether lowering uric acid levels in the blood could also lower blood pressure."

We did not find any additional studies to add to the three studies (211 participants) that were already included in the review. These studies evaluated adolescents and adults. They compared drug therapy, given to decrease uric acid, with a placebo control, in people diagnosed with hypertension."

Drug therapy decreased blood levels of uric acid better than placebo. The results for side effects were inconclusive between the drug therapy and placebo groups.\nThere is not enough evidence to show that drugs that lower blood levels of uric acid also reduce blood pressure in people with hypertension. More research on this question is needed."

      "heading": "Certainty of the evidence",
      "text": "Low-certainty evidence failed to establish whether drug therapy to treat high blood levels of uric acid reduces blood pressure. We reduced the certainty of the evidence because the studies presented limited data and inconsistent results for this outcome.\nHigh-certainty evidence found that uric acid-lowering drug therapy decreases uric acid.\nLow-certainty evidence failed to establish whether drug therapy increased the occurrence of side effects. We reduced the certainty of the evidence because of issues with study design, lack of data, and inconsistent results across studies.\nWe cannot be certain that future studies will not change these conclusions."
