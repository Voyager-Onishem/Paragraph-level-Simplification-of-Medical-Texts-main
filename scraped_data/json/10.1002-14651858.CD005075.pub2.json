      "text": "Non-specific cough has been defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology and is common in childhood. These children are treated with a variety of therapies, including non-pharmacological treatments. There is a wide variety and a growing market for these non-pharmacological treatments that include air-modification modalities."

There is a growing market for non-pharmacological treatments and these include air-modification modalities, (ionisers, vaporisers, humidifiers, air filters and regular vacuuming). No randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy of air-modulation modalities in the management of prolonged, non-specific cough in children were found. Therefore, based on the evidence currently available, a recommendation for these treatments cannot be given. Due to the popularity of air-modulation modalities, randomised controlled trials in this area are clearly needed."
