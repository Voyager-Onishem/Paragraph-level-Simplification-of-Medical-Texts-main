The methodological quality of the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up was evaluated to assess bias risk. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Authors were requested additional information in case of missing data. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed if appropriate."

Total complications of laparoscopic and small-incision cholecystectomy are high: 26.6% versus 22.9%. Total complications (risk difference, random-effects -0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to 0.05), hospital stay (weighted mean difference (WMD), random-effects -0.72 days, 95% CI -1.48 to 0.04), and convalescence were not significantly different. High-quality trials show a quicker operative time for small-incision cholecystectomy (WMD, high-quality trials 'blinding', random-effects 16.4 minutes, 95% CI 8.9 to 23.8) while low-quality trials show no significant difference."

Small-incision cholecystectomy has a significantly shorter operative time. Complications in elective cholecystectomy are prevalent."

  "pls": "The laparoscopic and the small-incision cholecystectomy are two alternative minimally invasive techniques for removal of the gallbladder. There are no significant differences in mortality and complications between the two minimal invasive procedures. The laparoscopic and the small-incision operation should be considered equal apart from a quicker operative time using the small-incision technique. The complications in both techniques are common."
