      "text": "Morton's neuroma is a common, paroxysmal neuralgia affecting the web spaces of the toes, typically the third. The pain is often so debilitating that patients become anxious about walking or even putting their foot to the ground. Insoles, corticosteroid injections, excision of the nerve, transposition of the nerve and neurolysis of the nerve are commonly used treatments. Their effectiveness is poorly understood."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "Three trials involving 121 people were included. There is, at most, a very limited indication that transposition of the transected plantar digital nerve may yield better results than standard resection of the nerve in the long term. There is no evidence to support the use of supinatory insoles. There are, at best, very limited indications to suggest that dorsal incisions for resection of the plantar digital nerve may result in less symptomatic post-operative scars when compared to plantar excision of the nerve."

  "pls": "Morton's neuroma is a common, painful condition affecting the web spaces of the toes. Limited evidence from one randomised controlled trial indicated that surgery involving cutting the relevant nerve and implanting it into a muscle tendon may yield better long-term results than standard surgical removal of the nerve. There is little evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of insoles. There were no randomised controlled trials reporting the effect of corticosteroid injections. Adverse events following surgery were common. Well-designed trials are needed to guide clinical practice."
