Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been extensively explored as a potential therapy in several preclinical and clinical settings. Human and animal MSCs have been shown to prevent and treat lung injury in various preclinical models of lung diseases, including experimental BPD."

      "text": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that often complicates the course of babies who are born too early. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia can lead to serious health issues during childhood and later in life. There is currently no effective and safe treatment for BPD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), cells that can multiply and turn into a different type of cell, can protect the damage to newborn lungs in experimental models of BPD. Mesenchymal stem cells may bring new hope for untreatable health issues in babies born too early, including BPD, and thus improve their survival and quality of life."
