  "pls": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a rare but potentially treatable cause of dementia. Since the condition was first described in 1965, it has conventionally been treated by placement of a shunt to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles of the brain. No trial has yet compared the placement of a shunt versus no shunt in a randomized controlled manner. Nor have the long-term outcomes of treated and untreated normal pressure hydrocephalus been compared. There is, therefore, no evidence for the use of shunts in the management of normal pressure hydrocephalus."
