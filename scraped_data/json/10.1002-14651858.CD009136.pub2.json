Several methods of administering heparin (UFH or LMWH) subcutaneously have been introduced to prevent adverse pregnant outcomes. The effectiveness and safety of different methods administering subcutaneous heparin (UFH or LMWH) during pregnancy have not been systematically evaluated."

VTE includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT is a clot in the deep veins of the leg blocking blood flow; parts of the clot may break away and be carried in the blood to the lungs, to form a PE. DVT is potentially, and PE is definitely, life-threatening for both mother and baby. Pregnant women with a history of VTE, antithrombin deficiency, or other risk factors for VTE are at an even greater risk and need heparin for prevention of VTE (prophylaxis). Although receiving subcutaneous heparin (either unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)) is the main option in the prevention of VTE during pregnancy, the management of thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women has mostly relied on the evidence from non-pregnant participants. Methods of receiving heparin subcutaneously include giving an injection at regular intervals, or using an indwelling catheter and an infusion pump. Women's satisfaction with receiving subcutaneous heparin is highly important as thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy involves a cost burden, inconvenience, and side effects as a result of a longer duration. Some women  may not self-administer heparin and must rely on others to give them their injections otherwise they stop using the heparin, thus exposing themselves to an increased risk of VTE. However, this review found no randomised controlled trials to show which methods of receiving subcutaneous heparin are effective and safe for pregnant women."
