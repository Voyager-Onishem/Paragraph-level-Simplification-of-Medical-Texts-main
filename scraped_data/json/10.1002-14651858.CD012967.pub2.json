Although alpha-lipoic acid (ALA, also known as thioctic acid) is widely used, there is no consensus about its benefits and harms."

      "heading": "Data collection and analysis",
      "text": "We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was change in neuropathy symptoms expressed as changes in the Total Symptom Score (TSS) at six months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes were change in neuropathy symptoms at six to 12 months and at 12 to 24 months, change in impairment, change in any validated quality of life total score, complications of DPN, and adverse events. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "Our analysis incorporated three trials involving 816 participants. Two studies included people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, while one study included only people with type 2 diabetes. The duration of treatment was between six months and 48 months. We judged all studies at high risk of overall bias due to attrition.\nALA compared with placebo probably has little or no effect on neuropathy symptoms measured by TSS (lower score is better) after six months (mean difference (MD) −0.16 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.83 to 0.51; 1 study, 330 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The CI of this effect estimate did not contain the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.97 points. ALA compared with placebo may have little or no effect on impairment measured by the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limbs (NIS-LL; lower score is better) after six months (MD −1.02 points, 95% CI −2.93 to 0.89; 1 study, 245 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, we cannot rule out a significant benefit, because the lower limit of the CI surpassed the MCID of 2 points. There is probably little or no difference between ALA and placebo in terms of adverse events leading to cessation of treatment within six months (risk ratio (RR) 1.48, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.35; 3 studies, 1090 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).\nNo studies reported quality of life or complications associated with DPN."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Our analysis suggests that ALA probably has little or no effect on neuropathy symptoms or adverse events at six months, and may have little or no effect on impairment at six months. All the studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Therefore, future RCTs should ensure complete follow-up and transparent reporting of any participants missing from the analyses."

      "heading": "What is diabetic peripheral neuropathy?",
      "text": "People with diabetes have too much sugar in their blood because their pancreas cannot make any insulin (type 1 diabetes) or cannot make enough insulin (type 2 diabetes). Diabetes is one of the most common non-communicable diseases (diseases not spread by infection), and it is becoming more common every year. People with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes develop complications.\nHigh blood sugar can decrease blood flow in the blood vessels that supply the nerves, resulting in nerve damage (diabetic peripheral neuropathy). The main symptom of this condition is pain. Other symptoms include tingling, a burning sensation, numbness, shooting or sharp aches, and even extreme sensitivity to clothes touching the skin. These symptoms are caused by direct nerve damage, which is different from typical pain caused by injury or tissue damage. For this reason, usual painkiller medicines do not alleviate pain caused by peripheral neuropathy. People with this condition can also experience weakness, loss of reflexes, or loss of sensation (together known as impairment), which can disrupt normal functions such as walking."

      "heading": "How is diabetic peripheral neuropathy treated?",
      "text": "Medicines used to treat depression or epilepsy may improve symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Some studies have suggested that alpha-lipoic acid (an antioxidant made naturally in the body) may help because of its presumed anti-inflammatory effects."

We also wanted to know if alpha-lipoic acid had any unwanted effects."

      "heading": "What did we find?",
      "text": "We found three studies that analysed 816 adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The participants received either alpha-lipoic acid or placebo. The dose of alpha-lipoic acid ranged from 600 mg/day to 1800 mg/day.\nAlpha-lipoic acid compared to placebo probably has little or no effect on symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and may have little or no effect on impairment after six months of treatment. There is probably little or no difference between alpha-lipoic acid and placebo in terms of unwanted effects that cause people to stop treatment.\nNo studies measured the effect of alpha-lipoic acid treatment on quality of life or complications of peripheral neuropathy.\nUntil alpha-lipoic acid is proven effective, there is no rationale for comparing it with active treatments."

    {
      "heading": "What are the limitations of the evidence?",
      "text": "We are moderately confident in the evidence on symptoms and unwanted effects because in all three studies, the investigators lost contact with many participants before the end of treatment (loss to follow-up). We have little confidence in the evidence on impairment, because of loss to follow-up and because the result was very imprecise."
