      "text": "Thirty-six studies involving 5464 participants with 5697 surgical wounds were identified. The types of surgery involved were hip and knee replacement, shoulder surgery, hip fracture surgery, spinal surgery, cruciate ligament reconstruction, open meniscectomy and fracture fixation surgery.\nPooling of results indicated no statistically significant difference in the incidence of wound infection, haematoma, dehiscence or re-operations between those allocated to drains and the un-drained wounds. Blood transfusion was required more frequently in those who received drains. The need for reinforcement of wound dressings and the occurrence of bruising were more common in the group without drains."

      "text": "There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support the routine use of closed suction drainage in orthopaedic surgery. Further randomised trials with larger patient numbers are required for different operations before definite conclusions can be made for all types of orthopaedic operations."

  "pls": "Drainage systems may be used to drain fluid, mostly blood, from surgical wounds after an operation. The drains can either be open or closed. Closed drains use vacuum bottles and plastic conduits to draw fluid away from the wound by producing a negative pressure. They have been evaluated within trials for a number of elective and emergency orthopaedic operations. Closed surgical drainage systems reduce the need for reinforcement of the dressing and bruising around the wound, but increase the need for blood transfusion. Wound drains do not appear to have any effect on the occurrence of wound infections, large blood collections within the wound (haematomas), or the need for additional surgery to correct wound healing complications.\nClosed suction wound drains in orthopaedic surgery are of doubtful benefit."
