      "text": "In this update, we include 28 studies (involving 2749 women). The evidence identified in this review comes from middle- to high-income countries. Generally the trials were at low risk of selection bias, performance bias and attrition bias, but some trials were at high risk of bias due to selective reporting and lack of blinding. Our GRADE certainty of evidence assessments ranged from moderate to very low certainty, with downgrading decisions based on study limitations, imprecision, and (for one comparison) indirectness.\nMost studies reported our primary outcome of adequate pain relief as reported by the women. No studies reported data relating to neonatal adverse events, duration of hospital stay, or breastfeeding rates. Almost half of the included studies (11/28) excluded breastfeeding women from participating, making the evidence less generalisable to a broader group of women.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared to placebo\nNSAIDs are probably better than placebo for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (risk ratio (RR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45 to 1.91; 11 studies, 946 women; moderate-certainty evidence). NSAIDs may reduce the need for additional pain relief compared to placebo (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.33; 4 studies, 375 women; low-certainty evidence). There may be a similar risk of maternal adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; 9 studies, 598 women; low-certainty evidence).\nNSAIDs compared to opioids\nNSAIDs are probably better than opioids for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.57; 5 studies, 560 women; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of maternal adverse events (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89; 3 studies, 255 women; low-certainty evidence). NSAIDs may be better than opioids for the need for additional pain relief, but the wide CIs include the possibility that the two classes of drugs are similarly effective or that opioids are better (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.12; 2 studies, 232 women; low-certainty evidence).\nOpioids compared to placebo\nOpioids may be better than placebo for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.61; 5 studies, 299 women; low-certainty evidence). Opioids may reduce the need for additional pain relief compared to placebo (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.82; 3 studies, 273 women; low-certainty evidence). Opioids may increase the risk of maternal adverse events compared with placebo, although the certainty of evidence is low (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.55; 3 studies, 188 women; low-certainty evidence).\nParacetamol compared to placebo\nVery low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if paracetamol is better than placebo for adequate pain relief as reported by the women, the need for additional pain relief, or risk of maternal adverse events (2 studies, 123 women).\nParacetamol compared to NSAIDs\nVery low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if there are any differences between paracetamol and NSAIDs for adequate pain relief as reported by the women, or the risk of maternal adverse events. No data were reported about the need for additional pain relief comparing paracetamol and NSAIDs (2 studies, 112 women).\nNSAIDs compared to herbal analgesia\nWe are uncertain if there are any differences between NSAIDs and herbal analgesia for adequate pain relief as reported by the women, the need for additional pain relief, or risk of maternal adverse events, because the certainty of evidence is very low (4 studies, 394 women).\nTranscutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) compared to no TENS\nVery low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if TENS is better than no TENS for adequate pain relief as reported by the women. No other data were reported comparing TENS with no TENS (1 study, 32 women)."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "NSAIDs may be better than placebo and are probably better than opioids at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth. NSAIDs and paracetamol may be as effective as each other, whereas opioids may be more effective than placebo. Due to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of other forms of pain relief. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of women and ensure greater generalisability by including breastfeeding women. In addition, further research is required, including a survey of postpartum women to describe appropriately their experience of uterine cramping and involution. We identified nine ongoing studies, which may help to increase the level of certainty of the evidence around pain relief due to uterine cramping in future updates of this review."

      "text": "Women may experience cramping pain and discomfort following the birth of their baby, as the uterus contracts and returns to its normal pre-pregnancy size. These pains usually last for two to three days after the birth. Women who have previously had a baby are more likely to experience after-birth pains. Breastfeeding stimulates the uterus to contract and increases the severity of the pains.\nTypes of pain relief used to treat the pain include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen and naproxen, opioids including codeine, and non-medicine methods such as herbal preparations and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)."

      "heading": "What evidence did we find?",
      "text": "We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials (October 2019) and identified 28 studies (2749 mothers) who were in hospital after uncomplicated single births. Most of the evidence is low-certainty because the studies did not include sufficient numbers of women. Many of the studies excluded breastfeeding women.This makes the evidence less relevant to a broader group of women. No studies reported evidence on adverse events in the newborn infants.\nNSAIDs are probably better than placebo (a dummy treatment) in giving adequate pain relief as reported by the women (11 studies, 946 women; moderate-certainty evidence), and they may reduce the need for additional pain relief (4 studies, 375 women; low-certainty evidence). There may be little difference between NSAIDs and placebo in the risk of adverse events in the mother (9 studies, 598 women; low-certainty evidence).\nNSAIDs are probably better than opioids in providing adequate pain relief as reported by the women (5 studies, 560 women; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of adverse events in the mother (3 studies, 255 women; low-certainty evidence). NSAIDs may slightly reduce the need for additional pain relief compared with opioids (2 studies, 232 women; low-certainty evidence).\nOpioids may be better than placebo for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (5 studies, 299 women; low-certainty evidence) and for the need for additional pain relief (3 studies, 273 women; low-certainty evidence). Opioids may increase the risk of adverse events in the mother compared with placebo (3 studies, 188 women; low-certainty evidence).\nVery low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if paracetamol is better than placebo for adequate pain relief as reported by the women, the need for additional analgesia, or risk of maternal adverse events (2 studies, 123 women).\nVery low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if there are any differences between paracetamol and NSAIDs for adequate pain relief as reported by the women, or the risk of maternal adverse events (2 studies, 112 women).\nVery low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if NSAIDs are better than herbal pain relief for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (4 studies, 394 women), the need for additional pain relief (1 study, 90 women) or risk of maternal adverse events (1 study, 108 women).\nVery low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if there is any difference between TENS and no TENS for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (1 study, 32 women)."
