This review assesses the role of benzodiazepines in the pharmacological treatment of this problem."

For homogeneous dichotomous data the fixed effects relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, reviewers calculated weighted mean differences."

      "text": "Two small (total N=27) randomised controlled trials were included. By seven to 14 days, there was a reduction in symptoms for those patients receiving clonazepam compared with placebo (2 RCTs, N=26, RR 0.09 CI 0.01 to 0.6, NNT 1.2 CI 0.9 to 1.5). No significant difference was found for adverse events (2 RCTs, N=26, RR 3.00 CI 0.2 to 62) or the need for anticholinergic medication (2 RCTs, N=26, RR 1.56 CI 0.9 to 2.7). No one left the two studies early. Data on mental, social and family outcomes could not be pooled and there was little or no data on user satisfaction, deaths, violence, criminal behaviour and costs."

  "pls": "Akathisia is a common and distressing adverse effect of many antipsychotic drugs. It is characterised by restlessness and mental unease, which can be intense. It is associated with patterns of restless, including rocking, walking on the spot when standing, shuffling, or swinging one leg on the other when sitting. People may constantly pace up and down in an attempt to relieve the sense of unrest. Several strategies have been used to decrease akathisia, and this review is one in a series over viewing the effects of drug treatments. Evidence for the use of benzodiazepines is so limited that no firm treatment recommendations are possible, although there may be some effects that are worthy of further investigation."
