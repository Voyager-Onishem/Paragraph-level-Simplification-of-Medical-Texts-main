      "text": "Twenty-six randomized clinical trials fulfilled entry criteria. No study assessed combined long-term morbidity. Routine vitamin E supplementation significantly increased hemoglobin concentration by a small amount. Vitamin E significantly reduced the risk of germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage and increased the risk of sepsis; however, heterogeneity limits the strength of these latter two inferences. Vitamin E did not significantly affect other morbidity or mortality. In VLBW infants, vitamin E supplementation significantly increased the risk of sepsis, and reduced the risk of severe retinopathy and blindness among those examined. \nSubgroup analyses demonstrated (1) an association between intravenous, high-dose vitamin E supplementation and increased risk of sepsis and of parenchymal cerebral hemorrhage; (2) an association between vitamin E supplementation by other than the intravenous route and reduced risk of germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage and of severe intraventricular hemorrhage; and (3) an association between serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl and increased risk of sepsis and reduced risk for severe retinopathy among those examined."

In very low birth weight infants, vitamin E increased the risk of sepsis, and reduced the risk of severe retinopathy and blindness among those examined. Evidence does not support the routine use of vitamin E supplementation by intravenous route at high doses or aiming at serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl."

  "pls": "Giving extra vitamin E to preterm babies can provide some benefits, but it increases the risk of life-threatening infections. Preterm babies (born before 37 weeks) can develop a range of problems because their organs are not mature. Vitamin E may be able to help prevent or limit some of these problems, but it can potentially also have harmful effects. Breast milk of a woman who has given birth prematurely has higher than usual levels of vitamin E. Preterm babies can be given extra vitamin E as vitamin drops, in vitamin E-enriched formula, in intravenous fluids, or by injection into their muscles. This review of studies of vitamin E supplements found that while extra vitamin E reduces the chances of some complications (including disease of the retina), the risk of life-threatening infection is increased. The risk of bleeding in the brain is increased when extra vitamin E is given by vein but decreased when the extra vitamin E is given by other routes."
