The most common site of failure after resection is within the remaining liver. With this pattern of clinical failure in mind and in order to enhance survival, chemotherapy has been delivered directly to the liver post resection via the hepatic artery."

No significant advantage was found in the meta-analysis for hepatic artery chemotherapy measuring overall survival and calculating survival based upon \"intention to treat\" (lnHR = 0.0848; favouring the control group, 95% confidence interval = -0.1189 to 0.2885, or a Hazard Ratio of 1.089, an 8.9% survival advantage for the control group, 95% CI of the HR = 0.887 - 1.334). Adverse events related to the hepatic artery therapy were common, including five therapy related deaths. Intra-hepatic recurrence was more frequent in the control group (97 patients versus 43 in the HAI group), though denominators are not reported, and additional outcomes could not be subjected to a combined analysis."

  "pls": "Patients who die of colorectal cancer usually die from, or at least with, liver metastases. On the other hand, isolated liver metastases can, on occasion, be resected with a chance of cure, if metastatic disease is not present elsewhere. After liver resection is performed for colorectal cancer metastases, the most common site of treatment failure is in the remaining liver. For that reason it has been proposed that chemotherapy be given in the hepatic artery after surgery to treat microscopic disease in the remaining liver. \nThis systematic review assesses the randomised trials that have addressed the effective ness of this additional chemotherapy. Seven studies have been published in this field, and the combined analysis shows that survival is not improved by hepatic artery chemotherapy."
