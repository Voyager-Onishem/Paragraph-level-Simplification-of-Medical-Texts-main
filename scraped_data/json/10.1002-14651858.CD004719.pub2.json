      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "In terms of clinical outcomes, women with schizophrenia seem to fare better then men, but appear more vulnerable to psychotic illness in the period after birth and menopause. As these vulnerable periods to psychosis are associated with estrogen withdrawal, this hormone has been proposed as a treatment for schizophrenia."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "All available evidence relates to women. Four studies (n=108) compared estrogen only with placebo. Short-term scores for general mental state showed no significant difference between groups (n=24, 1 RCT, WMD PANSS for 100mcg comparison -2.26 CI -15.4 to 10.9). Data from all four studies showed overall loss from the studies was low (Ëœ5%), with no significant differences between groups (n=96, 4 RCTs, RR 0.95 CI 0.2 to 6.1). Skewed continuous data from two studies showed no clear differences in ratings of movement disorders.\nOne medium-term unpublished study (n=14) compared estrogen and progesterone with placebo. Data at six months showed no difference between groups for total scores (n=9, WMD PANSS -25.3 CI -51 to 0.1). For negative symptoms, results favoured the estrogen and progesterone group (n=9, WMD PANSS negative subscale -9.0 CI -17 to -0.9). For loss to follow up there was no difference between groups (n=10, RR 0.33 CI 0.02 to 6.7). This trial used many cognitive tests and one visual retention test showed statistically significant differences favouring the treatment group: total scores (n=8, WMD -3.5 CI -5.7 to -1.3)."

  "pls": "The effects of estrogen as sole treatment or adjunctive therapy for those with schizophrenia are unclear. This review found very few relevant trials and data. The majority of results showed no effect and those that did were too weak to draw firm conclusions from. Results from unpublished trials are awaited before recommendations for more research can be made."
