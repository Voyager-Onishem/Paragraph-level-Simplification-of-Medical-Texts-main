We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched March 2020), checked references in all relevant papers for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors and researchers in the field."

Only studies with anticoagulants or antiplatelet treatment as the control group were included. Two review authors planned to independently extract data."

Secondary outcomes were death, any stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, residual stenosis (> 50%), recurrence of cervical dissection, expanding pseudoaneurysm, or major bleeding. We analysed the studies according to the first choice of treatment. We planned to assess for risk of bias and apply GRADE criteria for any included studies."

      "text": "No RCTs or CCTs compared either surgery or endovascular therapy with control. Thus, there is no available evidence to support their use for the treatment of extracranial cervical artery dissection in addition to antithrombotic therapy in people who continue to have neurological symptoms when treated with antithrombotic therapy alone."

      "text": "This review was conducted to establish whether a surgical operation or a keyhole endovascular treatment, such placement of stent in addition to blood-thinning medication would improve outcomes in people with cervical artery dissection for whom treatment with blood-thinning medication alone does not improve persistent or worsening symptoms of stroke. The outcomes which we wished to assess are permanent brain damage and long-term disability from stroke."

    {
      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "Cervical artery dissection is a tear in the wall of the blood vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain. There are two of each artery, a carotid artery on the right and one on the left of the neck, and a vertebral artery on the right and one on the left of the neck. When tears occur in the walls of these arteries, clots can form inside the artery. These clots can then break away from the artery wall and travel to the brain to cause a stroke. The standard way of treating tears in these arteries is to give patients medications which thin the blood and reduce clot formation. However, sometimes patients continue to get symptoms of stroke, and their condition worsens despite being on maximum dose medication."

      "text": "We did not find any trials that matched the criteria of the review. Therefore, there is no available objective evidence that an operation or a radiological procedure can benefit patients who continue to have symptoms of stroke despite medical therapy. We did find a number of reports from experienced groups of doctors that operations and radiological interventions were safe in their hands. However, we found no evidence that this could be applicable to other hospitals and clinical teams. Therefore, large scale, well-conducted studies are required to answer the review question."
