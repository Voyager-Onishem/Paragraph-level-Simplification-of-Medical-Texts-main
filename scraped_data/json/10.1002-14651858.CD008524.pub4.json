      "text": "Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries, affecting 190 million children under five years of age and leading to many adverse health consequences, including death. Based on prior evidence and a previous version of this review, the World Health Organization has continued to recommend vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for children aged 6 to 59 months. The last version of this review was published in 2017, and this is an updated version of that review."

      "text": "The updated search identified no new RCTs.\nWe identified 47 studies, involving approximately 1,223,856 children. Studies were set in 19 countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, 16 of these in India; 8 (17%) in Africa; 7 (15%) in Latin America, and 2 (4%) in Australia. About one-third of the studies were in urban/periurban settings, and half were in rural settings; the remaining studies did not clearly report settings. Most studies included equal numbers of girls and boys and lasted about one year. The mean age of the children was about 33 months. The included studies were at variable overall risk of bias; however, evidence for the primary outcome was at low risk of bias.\nA meta-analysis for all-cause mortality included 19 trials (1,202,382 children). At longest follow-up, there was a 12% observed reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for VAS compared with control using a fixed-effect model (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.93; high-certainty evidence).\nNine trials reported mortality due to diarrhoea and showed a 12% overall reduction for VAS (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98; 1,098,538 children; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference for VAS on mortality due to measles (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11; 6 studies, 1,088,261 children; low-certainty evidence), respiratory disease (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.12; 9 studies, 1,098,538 children; low-certainty evidence), and meningitis. VAS reduced the incidence of diarrhoea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.87; 15 studies, 77,946 children; low-certainty evidence), measles (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.67; 6 studies, 19,566 children; moderate-certainty evidence), Bitot's spots (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.53; 5 studies, 1,063,278 children; moderate-certainty evidence), night blindness (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.50; 2 studies, 22,972 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and VAD (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78; 4 studies, 2262 children, moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference on incidence of respiratory disease (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 11 studies, 27,540 children; low-certainty evidence) or hospitalisations due to diarrhoea or pneumonia. There was an increased risk of vomiting within the first 48 hours of VAS (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.69; 4 studies, 10,541 children; moderate-certainty evidence)."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "This update identified no new eligible studies and the conclusions remain the same. VAS is associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in morbidity and mortality in children. Further placebo-controlled trials of VAS in children between six months and five years of age would not change the conclusions of this review, although studies that compare different doses and delivery mechanisms are needed. In populations with documented VAD, it would be unethical to conduct placebo-controlled trials."

VAD predisposes children to increased risk of a range of problems, including respiratory diseases, diarrhoea, measles, and vision problems, and it can lead to death. Previous studies show that giving synthetic vitamin A supplementation (VAS) to children aged six months to five years who are at risk of VAD can reduce the risk of death and some diseases. This is an update of the previous review."

      "text": "The data on the effect of VAS for the prevention of death were available from 19 of the included studies, and the combined results indicate that VAS reduces overall risk of death and death due to diarrhoea by 12%. VAS does not specifically reduce death due to measles, respiratory infections, or meningitis, but it can reduce new occurrences of diarrhoea and measles. There was no effect on incidence of respiratory disease or admissions to hospital due to diarrhoea or pneumonia. Giving oral synthetic vitamin A to children at risk of VAD reduces the risk of night blindness and tiny flakes of protein in the eye called Bitot's spots. It also improves levels of vitamin A in their blood. The only reported side effect was risk of vomiting within 48 hours of taking vitamin A in large doses, as recommended by the World Health Organization."

      "heading": "Certainty of evidence",
      "text": "We rated the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach, which considers methodological flaws within studies, consistency in reporting of results across studies, extent to which results apply to other settings, and effectiveness of treatments. Based on these criteria, we judged the overall certainty of evidence to be high for benefits of VAS against overall risk of death and death due to diarrhoea. For the other outcomes, we rated the evidence as low or moderate. One large, recently conducted study, which included about one million children, did not show any effect of VAS; however, when this study was combined with other, well-conducted studies, VAS still had beneficial effects for the prevention of death and illness. In summary, VAS can reduce risk of illness and death in children aged 6 to 59 months of age who are at risk of VAD. This update did not identify and new eligible studies and the conclusions remain the same."
