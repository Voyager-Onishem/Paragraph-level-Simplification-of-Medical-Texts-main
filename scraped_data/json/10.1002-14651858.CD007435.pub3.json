Only two of the three included trials were pooled in the meta-analysis, as one trial was judged to have an unacceptably high risk of bias. In the meta-analysis of two RCTs (50 participants), coenzyme Q10 did not significantly change systolic BP: -3.68 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) -8.86 to 1.49), or diastolic BP: -2.03 mm Hg (95% CI -4.86 to 0.81] ), based on clinic data."

In one of three trials reporting adverse effects, coenzyme Q10 was well tolerated. Due to the small number of individuals and studies available for analysis, more well-conducted trials are needed."

These studies measured the effects of coenzyme Q10 on blood pressure in non-hospitalized men and women who took the drugs for 8 to 12 weeks. One of the three trials was judged to have an unacceptably high risk of bias and was not included in the pooled analysis. The total number of patients studied in the two pooled trials was 50."
