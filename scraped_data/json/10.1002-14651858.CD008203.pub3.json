Analysis showed that when compared with placebo rosuvastatin reduced the incidence of VTE (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.86) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.79), the risk of any (fatal and non-fatal) myocardial infarction (MI) (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.69), and any (fatal and non-fatal) stroke (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78). There was no difference in the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.46), fatal MI (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.53 to 4.22), fatal stroke (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.09) or death after VTE (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.24). The incidence of any serious adverse events was no different between the rosuvastatin and placebo groups (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.20)."

  "pls": "Background\nVenous thrombosis or thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition in which a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein and causes a blockage. The blockage most commonly occurs in the 'deep veins' of the lower legs, thighs or pelvis and is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If part of or the entire clot breaks away and is carried through the blood (venous) system it is called an embolism. Should the clot reach the lungs, it is known as a pulmonary embolism (PE) and is life threatening. VTE affects about 3,705,000 people worldwide annually and is one of the most preventable causes of hospital deaths. Statins are well known cholesterol-lowering drugs that are used in heart disease. They have other protective effects including anti-clotting properties and may be effective in the prevention of VTE. The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of statins in the primary prevention of VTE.\nKey results\nOur review included one published randomised controlled trial, involving 17,802 participants, which reported outcomes of VTE. This trial investigated rosuvastatin compared with placebo for the primary prevention of VTE. Analysis showed that, compared with placebo, rosuvastatin reduced the incidence of VTE and DVT, the risk of any (fatal and non-fatal) myocardial infarction, and any (fatal and non-fatal) stroke. There were no differences between rosuvastatin and placebo in the incidence of pulmonary embolism, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, and death after VTE. The incidence of any serious adverse events was not different between rosuvastatin and placebo. No firm conclusions or suggestions could be made from these findings. More randomised controlled trials of statins (including rosuvastatin) are needed to evaluate the efficacy of statins in the prevention of VTE.\nQuality of the evidence\nThe quality of the evidence was moderate because of imprecision, as the required sample size for the outcomes of this review was not achieved."
