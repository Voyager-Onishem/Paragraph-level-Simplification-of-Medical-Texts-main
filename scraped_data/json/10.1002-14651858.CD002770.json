      "text": "The five eligible trials reported on a total of 359 infants with RDS. Overall the risk of any reported mortality was less frequent in the MV group (summary RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74, 1.00; RD -0.10, 95% CI -0.20, -0.01; NNT 10, 95% CI 5, 100). In infants with a birth weight of 1 to 2 kg, no significant difference in mortality was found (summary RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70, 1.07). In infants with a birth weight of more than 2 kg there was a significant reduction in mortality with MV (summary RR 0.67, 95%CI 0.52, 0.87).\nAny IVH at autopsy was not significantly different between the groups in any study or overall in four studies reporting on 202 infants who had an autopsy. Pneumothorax was reported in two studies of 275 infants and there is a non-significant trend towards an increase in the mechanical ventilation group (summary RR 2.75, 95% CI 0.72, 10.45)."

      "text": "When MV was introduced in the 1960s to treat infants with severe respiratory failure due to pulmonary disease, trials showed an overall reduction in mortality which was most marked in infants born with a birthweight of more than 2 kg. This review does not provide information to evaluate the relative benefits or harms of MV in the setting of modern perinatal care."

  "pls": "Mechanical ventilation of newborn infants with severe lung disease results in reduced mortality. Mechanical ventilation with intermittent positive or negative pressure was introduced in the 1960s. It was compared with standard treatment in five trials for infants with very severe lung disease and resulted in a reduction in mortality. This effect was observed principally in infants with birth weights over two kilograms. Mechanical ventilation has become standard therapy for severe respiratory failure. There have been no trials in modern neonatal intensive care units so the magnitude of the benefits and harms in current practice are not known."
