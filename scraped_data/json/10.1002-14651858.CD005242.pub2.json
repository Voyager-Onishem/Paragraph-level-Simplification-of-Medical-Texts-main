Increased police patrols aim to increase both the perceived and actual likelihood of being caught driving while alcohol-impaired, potentially reducing alcohol-related driving, crashes and injuries."

      "text": "The 32 eligible studies included one randomized controlled trial, eight controlled before-after studies, 14 controlled ITS studies, six ITS studies, and three studies with both ITS and controlled before-after analyses. Most interventions targeted only alcohol-impaired driving (69%) and included additional interventions such as media campaigns or special training for police officers (91%). Only two studies reported sufficient information to assess study quality completely. Two-thirds of studies were scored 'not adequate' on at least one feature. Five of six studies evaluating traffic fatalities reported reductions with the intervention, but differences were statistically significant in only one study. Effects of intervention on traffic injuries were inconsistent in the six studies evaluating this outcome, and no results were statistically significant. All four controlled studies evaluating fatal crashes reported reductions with the intervention, which were statistically significant in one study. All 12 controlled studies assessing injury crashes reported greater reductions with the intervention, though effects were minimal or not significant in several studies. ITS studies showed less consistent effects on fatal crashes (three studies) and injury crashes (four studies), and effect estimates were typically imprecise. Thirteen of 20 studies showed reductions in total crashes and about two-thirds of these were statistically significant."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Studies examining increased police patrol programs were generally consistent in reporting beneficial effects on traffic crashes and fatalities, but study quality and reporting were often poor. Methodological limitations included inadequate sample size, dissimilar baseline measures, contamination, and inadequate data analysis. Thus existing evidence, although supportive, does not firmly establish whether increased police patrols, implemented with or without other intervention elements, reduce the adverse consequences of alcohol-impaired driving."

  "pls": "More than one million people are killed worldwide each year in traffic crashes. Driving after drinking alcohol increases the chance of a traffic crash. To reduce alcohol-impaired driving, some police agencies have increased the number of police patrols or the time the police spend patrolling. The aim of these increased patrols is to raise the perceived and actual likelihood that impaired drivers will be identified and stopped. Identification is based on observable behavioral cues, which include moving violations, erratic driving, and crash involvement. In response to these cues, police officers stop the driver and administer tests for alcohol impairment. We found 32 studies that tested the effects of increased police patrols on traffic deaths, injuries, and crashes. There was one randomized controlled trial and no quasi-randomized controlled trials. Almost all of the programs included additional interventions like community information programs, media campaigns, and special training for police officers. Most studies found that increased police patrols reduced traffic crashes and fatalities. Evidence for the effect on traffic injuries was less consistent. The detail provided on the methodology of included studies was almost uniformly poor. When this information was reported, the methodological quality was often weak. Therefore, the available evidence does not firmly establish that increased police patrols reduce the adverse consequences of alcohol-impaired driving. Good quality controlled studies with adequate sample size are needed to evaluate increased patrols. Also needed are studies assessing the cost-effectiveness of this intervention."
