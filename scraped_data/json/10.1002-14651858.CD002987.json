      "text": "Patients with chronic severe asthma are often dependent on the long term prescription of oral corticosteroids. The use of steroids is associated with serious side effects. Physicians treating such patients continue to search for alternative therapies that reduce the need for chronic dosing with oral steroids. Troleandomycin is a compound that is established as an effective antibiotic but may also have non-antibacterial actions that may be useful in the treatment of asthma."

There was no treatment effect for troleandomycin in terms of steroid dose reduction (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.75, 0.17). For measures of lung function a meta-analysis of data derived from two of the included studies showed no benefits for added troleandomycin (SMD 0.06 95% CI -0.8, 0.9)."
