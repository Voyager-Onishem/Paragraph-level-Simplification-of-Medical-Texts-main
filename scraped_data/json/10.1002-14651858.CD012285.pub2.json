Treatment of motor and phonic tics is difficult and challenging."

      "text": "Only one randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study met our selection criteria. In this study, 20 participants with motor tics were enrolled over a three-year recruitment period; 18 (14 of whom had a diagnosis of Tourette’s syndrome) completed the study; in total, 21 focal motor tics were treated. Although we considered most bias domains to be at low risk of bias, the study recruited a small number of participants with relatively mild tics and provided limited data for our key outcomes. The effects of botulinum toxin injections on tic frequency, measured by videotape or rated subjectively, and on premonitory urge, are uncertain (very low-quality evidence). The quality of evidence for adverse events following botulinum toxin was very low. Nine people had muscle weakness following the injection, which could have led to unblinding of treatment group assignment. No data were available to evaluate whether botulinum injections led to immunoresistance to botulinum."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "We are uncertain about botulinum toxin effects in the treatment of focal motor and phonic tics in select cases, as we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. Additional randomised controlled studies are needed to demonstrate the benefits and harms of botulinum toxin therapy for the treatment of motor and phonic tics in patients with Tourette’s syndrome."

There are conflicting reports regarding their effectiveness."

      "heading": "Key results",
      "text": "We found one small study. The study was limited by the number of participants (N = 18), who mainly had mild tics. We are very uncertain about the effects of botulinum toxin injections on reducing tic frequency and severity, and measures of overall well-being. Some participants experienced harms, which included weakness, restlessness, and neck discomfort following the injection. We do not know from the study whether participants who received the injection developed resistance to the botulinum injections, which would make them less effective over time.\nThe evidence is current to 25 October 2017."
