To identify further published, unpublished and ongoing studies we searched reference lists, handsearched conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of relevant articles."

We found no significant benefits of naftidrofuryl compared with placebo in reducing the risks of mortality (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.36, six studies) or combined death or dependency/disability (pooled OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16, three studies). Pooled results showed naftidrofuryl had no significant effect on systolic, diastolic or mean arterial blood pressure. No trials reported the effects of naftidrofuryl on the risk of early death or deterioration, quality of life, stroke recurrence, or discharge site. However, we found a trend towards an increase in risk of minor adverse events in patients taking naftidrofuryl (OR 1.99, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.11, P = 0.06)."

Stroke greatly adds to the burden on patients, carers, medical practitioners and health resources. The development of drugs to limit brain damage caused by stroke continues but no routine effective treatment has yet been identified. In previous years, naftidrofuryl has been considered as a potential treatment for acute stroke, but has been withdrawn from the market in the UK. This systematic review of six trials, involving 1274 participants, found there was not enough data to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of naftidrofuryl relating to survival or disability in the treatment of acute stroke."
