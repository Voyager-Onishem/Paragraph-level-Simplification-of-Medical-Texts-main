      "text": "Thalassemia syndromes are inherited hemoglobin disorders that result when the synthesis of normal hemoglobin is lacking or significantly reduced. For people with thalassemia, long-term red blood cell transfusion remains the mainstay of therapy, which may lead to iron overload causing severe complications and damage in different body organs. Long-term iron chelation therapy is essential for people with thalassemia to minimize the ongoing iron-loading process. In addition, suboptimal adherence can increase adverse events associated with iron overload and result in increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare utilization and cost of care."

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Groupâ€™s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (20 June 2019). We also searched for unpublished work in the abstract book of nine major conferences in the related field."

Non-randomized studies of interventions, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted-time-series studies were also eligible for inclusion."
