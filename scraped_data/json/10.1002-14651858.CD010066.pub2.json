      "text": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is one of several forms of pulmonary hypertension: a chronic disease of the pulmonary vasculature. The mean age at diagnosis is around 50 years old, with increasing prevalence in people over 70 years old (10% to 17%). The median survival to be approximately seven years with one-, three-, five-, and seven-year survival rates from time of diagnostic right-sided heart catheterization were 85%, 68%, 57%, and 49%, respectively. Several studies showed that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) reduce right ventricular hypertrophy and improve long-term haemodynamics in PAH."

      "text": "Currently, as there is lack of valid evidence, the efficacy and safety of CCBs is unproven in the treatment of PAH. However, the search strategy used for this review did identify four controlled clinical trials without randomization, three of which suggested treatment with CCBs may be beneficial in PAH. No adverse side effects of CCBs were reported. Confirmation of these findings by RCTs is recommended."

      "text": "The blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs is normally much lower than the blood pressure in the rest of the body. Pulmonary hypertension occurs when the pulmonary arterial pressure gradually rises which causes damage to the heart, and can finally lead to heart failure and death. Calcium channel blockers are drugs which can relax the pulmonary arteries and decrease resistance and pressure of these vessels; this may benefit patients with pulmonary hypertension."

      "text": "We found only one trial. This trial has not been published in full and instead was presented as an abstract at a conference. Therefore we had only limited data from this trial to consider. The trial assessed the use of calcium channel blockers for pulmonary hypertension and did not reveal any improving effect on patient's exercise capacity (a primary outcome of this review) by calcium channel blocker.\nWe believe more research is needed, specifically RCTs should be done on this topic. This is because evidence from several non-randomized controlled studies suggest possible benefits, but we cannot be certain without RCTs."
