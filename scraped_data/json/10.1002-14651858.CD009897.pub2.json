      "text": "There is no high quality evidence in the literature from RCTs to determine whether stereotactic radiotherapy is better than microsurgical resection or observation alone for patients with a vestibular schwannoma. In the absence of such evidence, the treatment method should be chosen on an individual basis, taking into consideration the patient's preferences, clinician experience and the availability of radiotherapeutic equipment. With the growing availability of radiotherapeutic equipment, randomised controlled trials should be undertaken to evaluate the role of stereotactic radiotherapy in comparison with other treatment options."

  "pls": "Vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas, are benign tumours of the eighth cranial nerve (responsible for hearing and balance). They can be treated by surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy (precisely delivered, focused brain irradiation), or just kept under observation because they may grow quite slowly or may not grow at all.\nWe searched the literature in order to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared stereotactic radiotherapy to other treatment methods. None of the studies we identified met the criteria for inclusion in this review.\nThere is currently no high quality evidence from RCTs to determine whether any of the treatment options for patients with a vestibular schwannoma have clear advantages over the others. Treatment therefore has to be selected on an individual basis, taking into account the patient's own preferences, clinician experience and the availability of radiotherapeutic equipment. Further research is needed to compare the efficacy and safety of all the different treatment options."
