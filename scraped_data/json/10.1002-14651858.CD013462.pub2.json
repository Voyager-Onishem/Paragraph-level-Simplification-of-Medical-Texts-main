We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For all analyses, we used the random-effects model. We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes."

      "text": "We included 11 RCTs involving a total of 1696 participants in the review. One RCT was a dual-center study; the other 10 RCTs were single-center studies conducted in: China (4 studies); Japan (2 studies); USA (1 study); Egypt (1 study); Germany (1 study); India (1 study); and Italy (1 study). The mean age of participants ranged from 54 to 68 years. All RCTs were at high risk of bias.\nDuct-to-mucosa versus any other type of pancreaticojejunostomy\nWe included 10 RCTs involving 1472 participants comparing duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy with invagination pancreaticojejunostomy: 732 participants were randomized to the duct-to-mucosa group, and 740 participants were randomized to the invagination group after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Comparing the two techniques, the evidence is very uncertain for the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (grade B or C; RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.26; 7 studies, 1122 participants; very low-certainty evidence), postoperative mortality (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.49; 10 studies, 1472 participants; very low-certainty evidence), rate of surgical reintervention (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.95; 10 studies, 1472 participants; very low-certainty evidence), rate of postoperative bleeding (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.42; 9 studies, 1275 participants; very low-certainty evidence), overall rate of surgical complications (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.36; 5 studies, 750 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and length of hospital stay (MD -0.41 days, 95% CI -1.87 to 1.04; 4 studies, 658 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The studies did not report adverse events or quality of life outcomes.\nOne type of duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy versus a different type of duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy\nWe included one RCT involving 224 participants comparing duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy using the modified Blumgart technique with duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy using the traditional interrupted technique: 112 participants were randomized to the modified Blumgart group, and 112 participants were randomized to the traditional interrupted group after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Comparing the two techniques, the evidence is very uncertain for the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (grade B or C; RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.75; 1 study, 210 participants; very low-certainty evidence), postoperative mortality (there were no deaths in either group; 1 study, 210 participants; very low-certainty evidence), rate of surgical reintervention (RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.18 to 20.91; 1 study, 210 participants; very low-certainty evidence), rate of postoperative bleeding (RR 2.89, 95% CI 0.12 to 70.11; 1 study, 210 participants; very low-certainty evidence), overall rate of surgical complications (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.51; 1 study, 210 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and length of hospital stay (15 days versus 15 days; 1 study, 210 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report adverse events or quality of life outcomes."

The evidence is also very uncertain whether duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy using the modified Blumgart technique is superior, equivalent or inferior to duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy using the traditional interrupted technique. None of the studies reported adverse events or quality of life outcomes."

      "heading": "What is a postoperative pancreatic fistula?",
      "text": "The pancreas is a digestive gland located at the back of the upper abdomen; it is also vital to the normal control of blood sugar. The standard surgical treatment for cancer or inflammation of the pancreas is partial removal of the head of the pancreas, together with the nearby gut, through a procedure known as pancreaticoduodenectomy. Pancreaticoduodenectomy involves reconnecting the pancreas and the second part of the small intestine (a procedure known as pancreaticojejunostomy) to allow pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes to enter the digestive system. A postoperative pancreatic fistula occurs when the reconnection does not heal properly, creating a leakage of pancreatic juice from the pancreas to the abdominal tissues. Postoperative pancreatic fistula is a complication that delays recovery from surgery and often requires further treatment to ensure complete healing."

The largest study included 308 people, and the smallest study included 64 people. The studies were conducted in countries around the world; most were done in China (4). Most studies lasted for approximately 2 years; only three studies lasted for 4 years or more. Non-commercial grants funded four of the studies. We cannot tell from the results of these studies whether duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy reduces:\n- rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula; or\n- death rate.\nThe studies did not report any unwanted effects.\nWe found only one single-center study involving 224 people in which modified duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy was compared with traditional duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy in people undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. The study was conducted in Japan and lasted for approximately 4 years. The study did not report its funding sources.
