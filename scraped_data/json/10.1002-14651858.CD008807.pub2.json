      "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) account for one-quarter of cases of acute respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICUs). A third to half of patients will die in the ICU, in hospital or during follow-up. Mechanical ventilation of people with ALI/ARDS allows time for the lungs to heal, but ventilation is invasive and can result in lung injury. It is uncertain whether ventilator-related injury would be reduced if pressure delivered by the ventilator with each breath is controlled, or whether the volume of air delivered by each breath is limited."

We pooled risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We assessed overall evidence quality using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "We included three RCTs that randomly assigned a total of 1089 participants recruited from 43 ICUs in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Spain and the USA. Risk of bias of the included studies was low. Only data for mortality and barotrauma could be combined in the meta-analysis. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the three mortality outcomes on the basis of serious imprecision around the effect estimates. For mortality in hospital, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.83 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; three trials, 1089 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and for mortality in the ICU, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; two trials, 1062 participants; moderate-quality evidence). One study provided no evidence of clear benefit with the ventilatory mode for mortality at 28 days (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 983 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The difference in effect on barotrauma between PCV and VCV was uncertain as the result of imprecision and different co-interventions used in the studies (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.77; two trials, 1062 participants; low-quality evidence). Data from one trial with 983 participants for the mean duration of ventilation, and from another trial with 78 participants for the mean number of extrapulmonary organ failures that developed with PCV or VCV, were skewed. None of the trials reported on infection during ventilation or quality of life after discharge."

More studies including a larger number of people given PCV and VCV may provide reliable evidence on which more firm conclusions can be based."

A third to half of people with ALI/ARDS die in the ICU, in hospital or during follow-up. People with ALI/ARDS are put on ventilator machines to give the lungs time to recover. However, lung damage can worsen if the volume of air delivered by these machines is too large, or if the pressure reached in the lungs during ventilation is too high.\nWe wanted to know whether controlling pressure in the lung during ventilation by varying the volume of air delivered (pressure-controlled ventilation, or PCV) was better than allowing varying lung pressures when a fixed volume of air is delivered (volume-controlled ventilation, or VCV)."

      "text": "We could not be sure whether the proportions of patients who died in hospital were very different between those treated with PCV and with VCV. For every 1000 persons treated with VCV, 636 deaths were reported. On the basis of our results, we could expect to see between 210 fewer deaths and 13 more deaths with PCV. We found that effects on mortality in the ICU and on mortality at 28 days were similarly uncertain. Our results include the possibility that VCV or PCV could be better for reducing the duration of ventilation or the development of traumatic lung damage caused by ventilation (barotrauma). None of the studies provided reliable information regarding to what extent failure of other organs would be impacted by the type of ventilation, nor did they provide information on differences in infection risk or quality of life following discharge from intensive care."
