      "text": "The keratocystic odontogenic tumours (KCOTs) account for between about 2% and 11% of all jaw cysts and can occur at any age. They are more common in males than females with a male:female ratio of approximately 2:1. Although they are benign, KCOTs are locally very aggressive and have a tendency to recur after treatment. Reported recurrence rates range from 3% to 60%. The traditional method for the treatment of most KCOTs is surgical enucleation. However, due to the lining of the cyst being delicate and the fact that they frequently recur, this method alone is not sufficient. Adjunctive surgical treatment has been proposed in addition to the surgical enucleation, such as removal of the peripheral bone (ostectomy) or resection of the cyst with surrounding bone (en-bloc) resection. Other adjunctive treatments proposed are: cryotherapy (freezing) with liquid nitrogen and the use of the fixative Carnoy's solution placed in the cyst cavity after enucleation; both of which attempt to address residual tissue to prevent recurrence."

      "text": "KCOTs are non-cancerous but fast-growing cysts (closed sacs containing either fluid or air) that occur mainly in the lower jawbone. They develop from the remains of a tissue associated with tooth development called the dental lamina. They are quite rare and can occur at any age.\nOne of the main problems in treating KCOTs is that if they are removed by surgery, they tend to recur. New cysts may form from any cyst lining that remains after surgery. These recurring cysts grow at a rapid rate. Some reports have stated that 6 out of 10 of these cysts will recur after treatment. Treatment to prevent recurrence can lead to large amounts of bone surrounding the cyst having to be removed.This carries major risks (damage to the nerves in the face, and loss of form and function in the face). Currently uncertainty exists regarding the best treatment option."
