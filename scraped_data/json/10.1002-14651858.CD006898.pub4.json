      "text": "Pressure, from lying or sitting on a particular part of the body results in reduced oxygen and nutrient supply, impaired drainage of waste products and damage to cells. If a patient with an existing pressure ulcer continues to lie or bear weight on the affected area, the tissues become depleted of blood flow and there is no oxygen or nutrient supply to the wound, and no removal of waste products from the wound, all of which are necessary for healing. Patients who cannot reposition themselves require assistance. International best practice advocates the use of repositioning as an integral component of a pressure ulcer management strategy. This review has been conducted to clarify the role of repositioning in the management of patients with pressure ulcers."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Despite the widespread use of repositioning as a component of the management plan for individuals with existing pressure ulcers, no randomised trials exist that assess the effects of repositioning patients on the healing rates of pressure ulcers. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether repositioning patients improves the healing rates of pressure ulcers. The effect of repositioning on pressure ulcer healing needs to be evaluated."

  "pls": "Pressure ulcers (also known as bed sores, pressure sores and decubitus ulcers) are localised areas of tissue damage caused by excess pressure and shearing forces. Pressure ulcers mainly occur in people who have limited mobility, nerve damage or both. Pressure, from lying or sitting on a particular part of the body, results in oxygen and nutrient deprivation to the affected area. Repositioning involves moving the individual into a different position in order to remove or redistribute pressure from a part of the body. If a person with an existing pressure ulcer continues to lie or bear weight on the affected area, the tissues become depleted of blood flow and there is no oxygen or nutrient supply to the wound, and no removal of waste products from the wound, all of which are necessary for healing. People who cannot reposition themselves require assistance. International best practice advocates the use of repositioning as an integral component of a pressure ulcer management strategy. The authors of this review found no studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review. Therefore, we do not know whether repositioning people makes any difference to the healing rates of pressure ulcers."
