      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "We included nine RCTs reporting 748 arterial cannulations in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) undergoing different surgical procedures. Eight RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. Five studies reported the incidence of haematomas. Seven involved radial artery cannulation and two involved femoral artery cannulation.\nThe people performing arterial cannulation were physicians with different levels of experience. The risk of bias varied across studies, with some studies lacking details of allocation concealment. It was not possible to blind practitioners in any case; this adds a performance bias that is inherent to the type of intervention studied in our review.\nCompared to traditional methods, ultrasound guidance probably causes a large increase in first-attempt success rates (risk ratio (RR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 2.46; 8 RCTs, 708 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably causes a large reduction in the risk of complications such as haematoma formation (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.47; 5 RCTs, 420 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies reported data about ischaemic damage. Ultrasound guidance probably improves success rates within two attempts (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.51; 2 RCTs, 134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and overall rate of successful cannulation (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.59; 6 RCTs, 374 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In addition, ultrasound guidance probably reduces the number of attempts to successful cannulation (mean difference (MD) −0.99 attempts, 95% CI −1.15 to −0.83; 5 RCTs, 368 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and duration of the cannulation procedure (MD −98.77 seconds, 95% CI −150.02 to −47.52, 5 RCTs, 402 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).\nMore studies are needed to confirm whether the improvement in first-attempt success rates is more pronounced in neonates and younger children compared to older children and adolescents."

      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "An arterial catheter is a thin tube that can be inserted into an artery to monitor blood pressure during complex surgeries and during stays in intensive care. Ultrasound (an imaging method that uses sound waves to capture live images of soft tissue) can help doctors to locate the artery and insert the catheter. In children in particular, ultrasound may reduce the need for multiple needle sticks, the occurrence of haematoma (a collection of blood outside the blood vessels) and damage to the artery, compared with other techniques such as palpation of the artery (feeling through the skin for the pulse) or Doppler auditory assistance (listening for a change to a higher pitch at the exact location of the artery)."

      "heading": "What did we find?",
      "text": "We found nine eligible studies: eight comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. Seven studies were of radial artery cannulation and two studies were of femoral artery cannulation. Four studies did not mention any funding source and five studies had departmental funds. The studies included children aged from under one month to 18 years."

    {
      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "We found that ultrasound guidance compared with traditional methods probably increases the rate of successful cannulation on first attempt, within the first two attempts, and after several attempts. Ultrasound guidance probably reduces the occurrence of haematoma, the number of attempts needed to successfully place an arterial catheter, and the time needed to perform successful cannulation. The evidence suggests that ultrasound is probably superior for arterial cannula insertion in children and adolescents, including very young children."
