      "text": "Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood illnesses. While many children experience sporadic AOM episodes, an important group suffer from recurrent AOM (rAOM), defined as three or more episodes in six months, or four or more in one year. In this subset of children AOM poses a true burden through frequent episodes of ear pain, general illness, sleepless nights and time lost from nursery or school. Grommets, also called ventilation or tympanostomy tubes, can be offered for rAOM."

The comparators included active monitoring, antibiotic prophylaxis and placebo medication."

Primary outcomes were: proportion of children who have no AOM recurrences at three to six months follow-up (intermediate-term) and persistent tympanic membrane perforation (significant adverse event). Secondary outcomes were: proportion of children who have no AOM recurrences at six to 12 months follow-up (long-term); total number of AOM recurrences, disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life, presence of middle ear effusion and other adverse events at short-term, intermediate-term and long-term follow-up. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Current evidence on the effectiveness of grommets in children with rAOM is limited to five RCTs with unclear or high risk of bias, which were conducted prior to the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination. Low to very low-quality evidence suggests that children receiving grommets are less likely to have AOM recurrences compared to those managed by active monitoring and placebo medication, but the magnitude of the effect is modest with around one fewer episode at six months and a less noticeable effect by 12 months. The low to very low quality of the evidence means that these numbers need to be interpreted with caution since the true effects may be substantially different. It is uncertain whether or not grommets are more effective than antibiotic prophylaxis. The risk of persistent tympanic membrane perforation after grommet insertion was low.\nWidespread use of pneumococcal vaccination has changed the bacteriology and epidemiology of AOM, and how this might impact the results of prior trials is unknown. New and high-quality RCTs of grommet insertion in children with rAOM are therefore needed. These trials should not only focus on the frequency of AOM recurrences, but also collect data on the severity of AOM episodes, antibiotic consumption and adverse effects of both surgery and antibiotics. This is particularly important since grommets may reduce the severity of AOM recurrences and allow for topical rather than oral antibiotic treatment."

While most children have an occasional episode, some suffer from recurring ear infections (three or more infections over a period of a six months, or four or more in a year). Such recurring infections cause considerable distress through frequent ear pain, fever, general illness, sleepless nights and time lost from nursery or school for the child and from work for their carers. Grommets, also known as ventilation or tympanostomy tubes, can be offered as a treatment. They are tiny plastic tubes put into the eardrum by an ENT surgeon during a short operation."

      "text": "We primarily looked at the difference in the proportion of children who had no further acute middle ear infections at three to six months follow-up (intermediate-term), and who had a persisting perforation (hole) in the ear drum. We also looked at some other outcomes, including the proportion of children who had no further episodes of acute middle ear infection.\nGrommets versus active monitoring\nWe found low-quality evidence that fewer children who were treated with grommets had further episodes of ear infection at six and 12 months follow-up than those managed with active monitoring; three and eight children needed to be treated with grommets to benefit one, respectively. The number of ear infections at six and 12 months follow-up was also lower in the grommets group; the difference was, however, at best modest with around one fewer episode at six months and a less noticeable effect by 12 months (low to very low-quality evidence ). Children treated with grommets did not have better quality of life at four or 12 months follow-up (low-quality evidence).\nGrommets versus antibiotic prophylaxis\nIt is uncertain whether or not grommets are more effective than antibiotic prophylaxis; we found very low-quality evidence that fewer children who were treated with grommets had further ear infections at six months than those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (preventative antibiotics); five children needed to be treated with grommets to benefit one. The number of ear infections at six months, however, did not significantly differ between children treated with grommets and those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (very-low quality evidence).\nGrommets versus placebo drugs\nWe found very low-quality evidence that fewer children who were treated with grommets had further ear infections at six months than those receiving placebo drugs; three children needed to be treated with grommets to benefit one. The number of ear infections at six months was also lower in the grommets group; the difference was however at best modest with around one fewer episode (very low-quality evidence).\nNegative effects of grommets were not systematically reported in the studies. Two studies reported on the number of children with a persistent perforation of the ear drum; this occurred in 0% (0/54) and 4% (3/76) of children receiving grommets, respectively (low-quality evidence)."

      "heading": "Quality of evidence",
      "text": "We judged the quality of the evidence on the benefits and harms of placement of grommets in both ears for children with recurring acute middle ear infections to be low to very low due to study limitations (risk of bias) and the small to very small sample sizes of included studies (leading to imprecise effect estimates). This means that the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution since the true effects of grommets in this group of children may be different than the numbers presented."
