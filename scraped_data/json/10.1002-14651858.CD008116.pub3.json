Current symptomatic treatments have limited benefit. Corticosteroids are an effective treatment in other upper respiratory tract infections and their anti-inflammatory effects may also be beneficial in the common cold. This updated review has included one additional study."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "We included three trials (353 participants). Two trials compared intranasal corticosteroids to placebo and one trial compared intranasal corticosteroids to usual care; no trials studied oral corticosteroids. In the two placebo-controlled trials, no benefit of intranasal corticosteroids was demonstrated for duration or severity of symptoms. The risk of bias overall was low or unclear in these two trials. In a trial of 54 participants, the mean number of symptomatic days was 10.3 in the placebo group, compared to 10.7 in those using intranasal corticosteroids (P value = 0.72). A second trial of 199 participants reported no significant differences in the duration of symptoms. The single-blind trial in children aged two to 14 years, who were also receiving oral antibiotics, had inadequate reporting of outcome measures regarding symptom resolution. The overall risk of bias was high for this trial. Mean symptom severity scores were significantly lower in the group receiving intranasal steroids in addition to oral amoxicillin. One placebo-controlled trial reported the presence of rhinovirus in nasal aspirates and found no differences. Only one of the three trials reported on adverse events; no differences were found. Two trials reported secondary bacterial infections (one case of sinusitis, one case of acute otitis media; both in the corticosteroid groups). A lack of comparable outcome measures meant that we were unable to combine the data."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Current evidence does not support the use of intranasal corticosteroids for symptomatic relief from the common cold. However, there were only three trials, one of which was very poor quality, and there was limited statistical power overall. Further large, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults and children are required to answer this question."

Although there are a number of medications used to help improve the symptoms of the common cold, none have good evidence of benefit. Steroids (corticosteroids) have been shown to help relieve symptoms in other types of upper respiratory tract infections by reducing the inflammation of the lining of the nose and throat, which means they might also improve the symptoms of the common cold."

      "text": "Our evidence is current to May 2015. We found three trials in total. Two trials recruited adults from the general population or from among hospital staff in Finland. These trials (total 253 adults) compared intranasal steroid sprays, which allow steroids to be puffed into the nostrils, to sprays containing placebo only. We found a third trial, which recruited 100 children referred to outpatient clinics in an Iranian paediatric hospital. This trial compared intranasal steroid spray to no spray and gave oral antibiotics to all participants."

The trial comparing steroid spray to no spray in children did find some evidence of benefit but we rated the quality of the evidence from this trial as very poor and the results were unclear. We could not combine the results of the trials to assess this question further. There were no reports of adverse events."

      "text": "The available evidence suggests that we should not use intranasal steroids for the common cold. However, as we found only three small trials, we cannot be sure that there is no effect without performing larger, well-designed trials."
