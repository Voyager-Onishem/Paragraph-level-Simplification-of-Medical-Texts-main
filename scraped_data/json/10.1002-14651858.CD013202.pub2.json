Stem cell-based therapies offer a potential therapeutic approach to repair or regenerate injured brain tissue. These preclinical findings have now culminated in ongoing human neonatal trials."

The primary outcomes considered in this review are all-cause neonatal mortality, major neurodevelopmental disability, death or major neurodevelopmental disability assessed at 18 to 24 months of age. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence."

      "text": "Lack of oxygen at birth may damage the brain of the newborn. Babies with less severe brain damage may make a full recovery or only have mild problems. For other babies with more serious damage, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. For instance, some of these babies develop cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or other problems. We currently have  only cooling as an approach to treat this condition. The aim of this review was to assess if stem cell-based therapies could reduce death and improve the long-term development of newborns with poor brain oxygenation at birth. During stem cell-based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance through injections. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that the lack of oxygen has damaged."
