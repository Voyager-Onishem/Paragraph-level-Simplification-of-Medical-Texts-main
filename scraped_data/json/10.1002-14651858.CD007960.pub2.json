The primary outcome was improvement in tinnitus measured with validated questionnaires. Secondary outcomes were improvement in tinnitus measured with self-assessment scores, improvement in global well-being or accompanying symptoms, and adverse drug effects."

      "text": "Seven trials (453 patients) were included in this review. These studies investigated four different anticonvulsants: gabapentin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and flunarizine. The risk of bias of most studies was 'high' or 'unclear'. Three studies included a validated questionnaire (primary outcome). None of them showed a significant positive effect of anticonvulsants. One study showed a significant negative effect of gabapentin compared to placebo with an increase in Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) score of 18.4 points (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 1.58). A second study showed a positive, non-significant effect of gabapentin with a difference compared to placebo of 2.4 points on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.25). When the data from these two studies are pooled no effect of gabapentin is found (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.40). A third study reported no differences on the THI after treatment with gabapentin compared to placebo (exact numbers could not be extracted from the article).\nA meta-analysis of 'any positive effect' (yes versus no) based on a self-assessment score (secondary outcome) showed a small favourable effect of anticonvulsants (RD 14%, 95% CI 6% to 22%). A meta-analysis of 'near or total eradication of tinnitus annoyance' showed no effect of anticonvulsants (risk difference (RD) 4%, 95% CI -2% to 11%). Side effects of the anticonvulsants used were experienced by 18% of patients."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Current evidence regarding the effectiveness of anticonvulsants in patients with tinnitus has significant risk of bias. There is no evidence from studies performed so far to show that anticonvulsants have a large positive effect in the treatment of tinnitus but a small effect (of doubtful clinical significance) has been demonstrated."

The pathophysiology of tinnitus has been compared to phantom limb pain therefore anticonvulsant drugs have been proposed as a possible therapy.\nThis review includes seven studies (six low-quality and one high-quality) of four different anticonvulsants (gabapentin, carbamazepine, flunarizine and lamotrigine). We found that anticonvulsants do not have a beneficial effect in the treatment of tinnitus. Side effects of the anticonvulsants used were experienced by 18% of patients."
