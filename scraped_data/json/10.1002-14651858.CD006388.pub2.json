      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "No randomised controlled trials were identified. Nineteen case reports of 20 neonates with chylothorax in whom octreotide was used either subcutaneously or intravenously were identified. Fourteen case reports described successful use (resolution of chylothorax), four reported failure (no resolution) and one reported equivocal results following use of octreotide. The timing of initiation, dose, duration and frequency of doses varied markedly. Gastrointestinal intolerance and clinical presentations suggestive of necrotizing enterocolitis and transient hypothyroidism were reported as side effects."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "No practice recommendation can be made based on the evidence identified in this review. A prospective registry of chylothorax patients and a subsequent multicenter randomised controlled trial are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of octreotide in the treatment of chylothorax in neonates."

  "pls": "Collection of lymphatic fluid in the chest cavity is called chylothorax. Routine management of this condition involves treatment of the underlying condition, draining of fluid, putting a tube in the chest wall until all the fluid is drained and rarely surgery. Octreotide is a drug that may reduce the production and accumulation of fluid and allow babies to recover faster. No trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of this drug in babies and only case reports are available. Future studies are needed."
