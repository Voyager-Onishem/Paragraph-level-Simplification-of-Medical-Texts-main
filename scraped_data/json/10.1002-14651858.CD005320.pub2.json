      "text": "In total hip replacement surgery, the whole hip joint can be replaced by an artificial joint or hip. About 3 out of 100 people who have this surgery will dislocate their hip. Dislocating a hip causes much pain and other problems. There are many ways to fix a dislocated hip. Usually, the first time a dislocation occurs the hip is put into a cast or brace. But repeated dislocations usually need to be fixed with surgery. Unfortunately, the causes for dislocation are many and some are not known making it difficult to know the best way to fix it."
