      "text": "Pain is a common feature of childhood and adolescence around the world, and for many young people, that pain is chronic. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. Views on children's pain have changed over time and relief of pain is now seen as important. In the past, pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, and it was assumed that children quickly forgot about painful experiences.\nWe designed a suite of seven reviews in chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol) to review the evidence for children's pain using pharmacological interventions.\nAs one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity for children and adolescents in the world today, childhood cancer (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Cancer pain in infants, children, and adolescents is primarily nociceptive pain with negative long term effects. Cancer-related pain is generally caused directly by the tumour itself such as compressing on the nerve or inflammation of the organs. Cancer-related pain generally occurs as a result of perioperative procedures, nerve damage caused by radiation or chemotherapy treatments, or mucositis. However, this review focused on pain caused directly by the tumour itself such as nerve infiltration, external nerve compression, and other inflammatory events.\nOpioids are used worldwide for the treatment of pain. Currently available opioids include: buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. Opioids are generally available in healthcare settings across most developed countries but access may be restricted in developing countries. To achieve adequate pain relief in children using opioids, with an acceptable grade of adverse effects, the recommended method is to start with a low dose gradually titrated to effect or unacceptable adverse effect in the child."

Its associated pain is a major health concern and specific data for children are not currently well known. Cancer-related pain is generally caused directly by a tumour compressing on nerves or by organ inflammation, and can very distressing.\nOpioids are used worldwide for the treatment of pain. Opioids are generally available in healthcare settings across most developed countries but access may be restricted in developing countries. For example, currently available opioids include: buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. Opioids are used in varying doses and commonly administered via injection or oral tablets."

We found no studies that met the requirements for this review. Several studies tested opioids on adults with cancer-related pain, but none in participants aged from birth to 17 years."

      "text": "We planned to rate the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low , low , moderate , or high . Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results.\nWe were unable to rate the quality of evidence as there was no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the suggestion that opioids in any dose will reduce cancer-related pain in children or adolescents."
