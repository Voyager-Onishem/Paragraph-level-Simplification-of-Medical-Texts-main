Shoulder-tip pain (STP) as a result of the laparoscopy occurs in up to 80% of women, with potential for significant morbidity, delayed discharge and readmission. Interventions at the time of gynaecological laparoscopy have been developed in an attempt to reduce the incidence and severity of STP."

      "text": "We included 32 studies (3284 women). Laparoscopic procedures in these studies varied from diagnostic procedures to complex operations. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency.\nSpecific technique versus \"standard\" technique for releasing the pneumoperitoneum\nUse of a specific technique of releasing the pneumoperitoneum (pulmonary recruitment manoeuvre, extended assisted ventilation or actively aspirating intra-abdominal gas) reduced the severity of STP at 24 hours (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.82 to -0.50; 5 RCTs; 670 participants; I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence) and reduced analgesia usage (SMD -0.53, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.35; 4 RCTs; 570 participants; I2 = 91%, low-quality evidence). There appeared to be little or no difference in the incidence of STP at 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.82; 1 RCT; 118 participants; low-quality evidence).\nNo adverse events occurred in the only study assessing this outcome.\nFluid instillation versus no fluid instillation\nFluid instillation is probably associated with a reduction in STP incidence (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.66; 2 RCTs; 220 participants; I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) and severity (mean difference (MD) (0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) scale) -2.27, 95% CI -3.06 to -1.48; 2 RCTs; 220 participants; I2 = 29%, moderate-quality evidence) at 24 hours, and may reduce analgesia usage (MD -12.02, 95% CI -23.97 to -0.06; 2 RCTs; 205 participants, low-quality evidence).\nNo study measured adverse events.\nIntraperitoneal drain versus no intraperitoneal drain\nUsing an intraperitoneal drain may reduce the incidence of STP at 24 hours (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.46; 3 RCTs; 417 participants; I2 = 90%, low-quality evidence) and may reduce analgesia use within 48 hours post-operatively (SMD -1.84, 95% CI -2.14 to -1.54; 2 RCTs; 253 participants; I2 = 90%). We are uncertain whether it reduces the severity of STP at 24 hours, as the evidence was very low quality (MD (0 to 10 VAS scale) -1.85, 95% CI -2.15 to -1.55; 3 RCTs; 320 participants; I2 = 70%).\nNo study measured adverse events.\nSubdiaphragmatic intraperitoneal local anaesthetic versus control (no fluid instillation, normal saline or Ringer’s lactate)\nThere is probably little or no difference between the groups in incidence of STP (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.23; 4 RCTs; 336 participants; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence) and there may be no difference in STP severity (MD -1.13, 95% CI -2.52 to 0.26; 1 RCT; 50 participants; low-quality evidence), both measured at 24 hours. However, the intervention may reduce post-operative analgesia use (SMD-0.57, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.21; 2 RCTs; 129 participants; I2 = 51%, low-quality evidence).\nNo adverse events occurred in any study.\nLocal anaesthetic into peritoneal cavity (not subdiaphragmatic) versus normal saline\nLocal anaesthetic into the peritoneal cavity may reduce the incidence of STP at 4 to 8 hours post-operatively (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.93; 2 RCTs; 157 participants; I2 = 56%; low-quality evidence). Our other outcomes of interest were not assessed.\nWarmed, or warmed and humidified CO2 versus unwarmed and unhumidified CO2\nThere may be no difference between these interventions in incidence of STP at 24 to 48 hours (OR 0.81 95% CI 0.45 to 1.49; 2 RCTs; 194 participants; I2 = 12%; low-quality evidence) or in analgesia usage within 48 hours (MD -4.97 mg morphine, 95% CI -11.25 to 1.31; 1 RCT; 95 participants; low-quality evidence); there is probably little or no difference in STP severity at 24 hours (MD (0 to 10 VAS scale) 0.11, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.97; 2 RCTs; 157 participants; I2 = 50%; moderate-quality evidence).\nNo study measured adverse events.\nGasless laparoscopy versus CO2 insufflation\nGasless laparoscopy may be associated with increased severity of STP within 72 hours post-operatively when compared with standard treatment (MD 3.8 (0 to 30 VAS scale), 95% CI 0.76 to 6.84; 1 RCT; 54 participants, low-quality evidence), and there may be no difference in the risk of adverse events (OR 2.56, 95% CI 0.25 to 26.28; 1 RCT; 54 participants; low-quality evidence).\nNo study measured the incidence of STP."

Some potentially useful interventions have not been studied by RCTs of gynaecological laparoscopy."

      "text": "Gynaecological keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is a procedure where a surgeon uses a camera (laparoscope) to see inside the lower abdomen to view the uterus (womb), fallopian tubes and ovaries. They can also use special instruments to do tests or treat certain gynaecological conditions. This is a common procedure that about 250,000 women in the UK have each year. Up to 80% of these women may experience shoulder-tip pain (STP), which may be very painful and lead to longer stays in hospital and even having to go back in to hospital.\nDuring the laparoscopy, the surgeon puts gas (carbon dioxide) into the patient’s abdomen (pneumoperitoneum). This inflates the abdomen so that the surgeon can see the organs in the abdominal cavity and can carry out surgery. It is possible that inflating the abdomen stimulates a nerve that runs from the top of the abdomen (diaphragm) up to the shoulders and neck, which causes STP.\nWe looked at several ways surgeons try to reduce STP: putting local anaesthetic (pain killer) directly into the abdominal cavity or diaphragm; using warmed carbon dioxide, sometimes with moisture added to it (humidified) during surgery; removing gas from the abdominal cavity with drains; replacing gas with fluid (fluid instillation) or forcing gas out of the abdominal cavity at the end of the procedure by increasing the pressure at which patients were made to breathe whilst still under anaesthetic (PRM)."
