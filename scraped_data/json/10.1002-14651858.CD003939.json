      "text": "The incidence and prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) and other reproductive tract infections (RTI) is high in much of the developing and parts of the developed worlds. STIs and RTIs are associated with the vaginal transmission of HIV. Additional strategies to improve STI control are needed, and vaginal microbicides are a possible strategy. One potential vaginal microbicide is the widely used spermicide, nonoxynol-9 (N-9)."

In meta-analysis, the risks of gonorrhoea (relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95%CI 0.67-1.24), cervical infection (RR 1.01, 0.84-1.22), trichomoniasis (RR 0.84, 0.69-1.02), bacterial vaginosis (0.88, 0.74-1.04), chlamydia (RR 0.88, 0.77-1.01) and candidiasis (RR 0.97, 0.84-1.12) were not statistically significantly different in women receiving N-9 compared with placebo. Genital lesions were more common in the N-9 users (RR 1.17, 95%CI 1.02-1.35)."
