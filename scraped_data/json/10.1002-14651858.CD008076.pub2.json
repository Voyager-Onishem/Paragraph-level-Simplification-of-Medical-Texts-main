In an effort to identify further published, ongoing and unpublished studies we searched journals, conference proceedings and ongoing trial registers, scanned reference lists from relevant studies and contacted trialists and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd."

We computed an estimate of treatment effect and performed a test for heterogeneity between trials. We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis and assessed bias for all included studies."

Compared with aspirin, cilostazol was associated with a significantly lower risk of composite outcome of vascular events (6.77% versus 9.39%, risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.91), and lower risk of haemorrhagic stroke (0.53% versus 2.01%, RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.55). In terms of outcome of safety compared with aspirin, cilostazol was significantly associated with minor adverse effects (8.22% versus 4.95%, RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.51 to 1.83)."

  "pls": "Stroke is a public health problem. As lower and middle income countries make rapid economic progress they face the additional health burden of diseases of affluence like stroke and heart attacks. Unlike heart attack, stroke is a disease caused by more than one mechanism. In Asians, a larger proportion of ischaemic stroke is due to narrowing of the arteries at the base of the brain. Compared to Caucasians, Asians are more likely to have bleeds into their brain matter causing stroke, because of uncontrolled high blood pressure. The medication cilostazol thins the blood by blocking platelet accumulation and appears, from early reports, to be more effective than aspirin in the prevention of stroke, heart attacks and death from vascular causes in patients with stroke. This may be due to its inherent effectiveness, as well as chances of fewer brain bleeds. In this review of two randomised trials involving 3477 participants, we found that cilostazol was more effective for the prevention of stroke, heart attack and death from vascular causes in Asian patients with stroke. In terms of safety, it causes more side effects than aspirin but less serious bleeding in the brain and the body."
