The pooled relative risk (RR) for death in trauma patients was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69 to1.04); in patients with burns 1.49 (95% CI 0.56 to 3.95); and in patients undergoing surgery 0.51 (95% CI 0.09 to 2.73). In the one trial that gave data on disability using the Glasgow outcome scale, the relative risk for a poor outcome was 1.00 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.22)."

      "text": "This review does not give us enough data to be able to say whether hypertonic crystalloid is better than isotonic and near isotonic crystalloid for the resuscitation of patients with trauma or burns, or those undergoing surgery. However, the confidence intervals are wide and do not exclude clinically significant differences. Further trials which clearly state the type and amount of fluid used and that are large enough to detect a clinically important difference are needed."

  "pls": "Fluid resuscitation is usually given when a patient has lost a lot of blood, but there is continuing uncertainty as to the best sort of fluid to use. Some of the fluids used contain substances classified as \"crystalloids\", but should the concentration of crystalloids in the fluid be about the same as their concentration in human blood (\"isotonic\") or higher (\"hypertonic\")? It is commonly believed that hypertonic crystalloid is the more effective at increasing blood volume but that there could be some disadvantages to using it. This review has assessed the evidence from studies that compared the use of the two types of fluid with patients who had been injured or burned, or were having surgery. Not enough evidence is available, however, to decide which crystalloid concentration is best. More research is needed."
