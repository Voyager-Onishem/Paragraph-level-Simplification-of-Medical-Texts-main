      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "We included 22 studies that involved 1746 participants. Among people with CKD who were not receiving dialysis, Cordyceps preparations were found to significantly decrease serum creatinine (14 studies, 987 participants): MD -60.76 Î¼mol/L, 95% CI -85.82 to -35.71); increase creatinine clearance (6 studies, 362 participants): MD 9.22 mL/min, 95% CI 3.10 to 15.34) and reduce 24 hour proteinuria (4 studies, 211 participants: MD -0.15 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.05). However, suboptimal reporting and flawed methodological approaches meant that risk of bias was assessed as high in four studies and unclear in 18 studies, and hence, these results need to be interpreted with caution."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "We found that Cordyceps preparation, as an adjuvant therapy to conventional medicine, showed potential promise to decrease serum creatinine, increase creatine clearance, reduce proteinuria and alleviate CKD-associated complications, such as increased haemoglobin and serum albumin. However, definitive conclusions could not be made because of the low quality of evidence."

  "pls": "People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience gradual worsening of kidney function. Cordyceps (Cordyceps sinensis), which is sometimes known as Chinese caterpillar fungus, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat people with CKD. We conducted this review to investigate if Cordyceps was a safe and effective treatment for people with CKD.\nWe searched the literature published up to April 2014 and assessed evidence from 22 studies conducted in China that involved 1746 people with CKD who received Cordyceps as part of their treatment.\nWe found some evidence to indicate that Cordyceps preparations given in addition to conventional Western medicine may be beneficial in improving kidney function and addressing some complications. However, evidence quality was poor, and no definitive conclusions could be made about Cordyceps for people with CKD."
