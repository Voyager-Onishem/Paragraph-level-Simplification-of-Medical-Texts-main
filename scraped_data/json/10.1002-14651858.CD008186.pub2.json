In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings, searched trials and research registers, checked reference lists and contacted authors."

      "text": "We included four trials involving 94 participants in this review. There was a significant improvement in activity of daily living (mean difference (MD) 13.20 points on the 'Capacidad funcional' (functional capacity) subscale of the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the SF-36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.36 to 18.04; P < 0.00001) and on muscle strength (MD 1.01 Nm/kg; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.83; P = 0.02) but these results should be interpreted with caution because population numbers were small and the results are based on single studies. There was no significant improvement in ability to walk (MD 0.14 m/s; 95% CI -0.32 to 0.606; P = 0.55), postural balance (MD 3.05 points; 95% CI -3.41 to 9.52; P = 0.35) or fitness (MD 3.6 (VO2max; 95% CI -0.53 to 7.73; P = 0.09) after water-based exercises treatment compared to control. Adverse effects were not reported."

There is a lack of hard evidence for water-based exercises after stroke. Better and larger studies are therefore required."

Water-based exercises are used in rehabilitation and might help to reduce disability after stroke. This review of four trials, which included 94 participants, found there is not enough evidence to decide if water-based exercises may reduce disability after stroke. There is a lack of hard evidence for water-based exercises after stroke. More research is therefore needed."
