Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events; our secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, pneumonia-related mortality, non-serious adverse events, and treatment failure. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow-up."

      "text": "We included four randomised clinical trials (84 participants). We assessed all trials as having high risk of bias.\nWe did not conduct any meta-analyses, as the included trials did not compare similar antibiotic regimens.\nEach of the four trials assessed a different comparison, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin.\nOnly one trial reported our primary outcomes of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community-acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital-acquired pneumonia constituted subgroups of the total sample sizes.\nWhere outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.\nNone of the included trials assessed health-related quality of life, pneumonia-related mortality, or non-serious adverse events."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "The relative beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the very low certainty of the available evidence. The current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. Randomised clinical trials assessing different antibiotic regimens for hospital-acquired pneumonia in children and neonates are warranted."

      "text": "Hospital-acquired pneumonia is an inflammation of the tissue of one or both lungs caused by an infection that occurs during a hospital stay (i.e. 48 hours or more after hospital admission). It is one of the most common hospital-acquired infections in children worldwide, and is associated with a high death rate. Most of our understanding of hospital-acquired pneumonia in children is drawn from adult studies. To our knowledge this is the first review with meta-analysis that assesses the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in newborns and children with hospital-acquired pneumonia."

Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community-acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital-acquired pneumonia constituted only subgroups of the total study populations.\nWhere outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons.
