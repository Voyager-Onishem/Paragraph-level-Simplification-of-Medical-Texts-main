      "text": "Azoospermia, the absence of sperm in ejaculated semen, is the most severe form of male-factor infertility and is present in approximately 5% of all investigated infertile couples. The advent of intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has transformed treatment of this type of severe male-factor infertility. Sperm can be retrieved for ICSI from either the epididymis or the testis, depending on the type of azoospermia."

      "text": "The search was revised and re-run in November 2007. No new trials were located therefore the results of the updated review remain unchanged from those published in 2006.\nTwo trials involving 98 men were included. The first small RCT had 59 participants and compared two epididymal techniques. The trial gave limited evidence that microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA) achieved a significantly lower pregnancy rate (one pregnancy in 29 procedures compared with seven pregnancies in 30 procedures; OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.83) and fertilisation rate (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.48) than the micropuncture with perivascular nerve stimulation technique. The other RCT comparing two testicular aspiration techniques (TSA) in 39 participants gave no statistically significant evidence for the superiority of the ultrasound-guided technique compared to the aspiration technique without ultrasound. TSA with ultrasound resulted in pregnancy in three out of 16 participants compared with four out of 23 participants (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.21 to 5.74)."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific sperm retrieval technique for azoospermic men undergoing ICSI. In the absence of evidence to support more invasive or more technically difficult methods, the review authors recommend the least invasive and simplest technique available. Further randomised trials are warranted, preferably multi-centred trials. The classification of azoospermia as obstructive and non-obstructive appears to be relevant to a successful clinical outcome and a distinction according to the cause of azoospermia is important for future clinical trials."

  "pls": "It is not certain whether any particular surgical technique used to remove sperm for ICSI (sperm injection in vitro fertilisation or IVF) is better than another for the men involved or for leading to more pregnancies.\nSome men are infertile because they produce sperm but a blockage in the testicle stops the sperm getting into the semen. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is the only option for helping these men conceive with their own sperm.\nThe sperm are surgically removed from the testis gland or epididymis (tube leading from the testis towards the penis) and several micro-surgical and suction techniques through hollow needles can be used for this. Sperm are then injected into an egg, an IVF procedure called ICSI. However, the review found there were too few trials to show which sperm removal technique might be better. Complications associated with surgical sperm-retrieval techniques are haematoma and fibrosis, identified by ultrasound."
