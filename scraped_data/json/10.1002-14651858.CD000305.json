      "text": "The 31 included trials involved at least 2958 predominantly female and elderly patients. Overall, trial quality was disappointing.\nTen trials involving 826 patients which compared U heparin with control, and five trials of 373 patients which compared LMW heparin with control, showed a reduction in the incidence of lower limb DVT (124/474 (26%) versus 219/519 (42%); relative risk (RR) 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.71). There were insufficient data to confirm the efficacy of either agent in the prevention of pulmonary embolism. There was no statistically significant difference in overall mortality (42/356 (12%) versus 38/374 (10%); RR 1.16; 95%CI 0.77 to 1.74). Data were inadequate for all other outcomes including wound complications. There is insufficient evidence from five trials, involving 644 patients, to establish if LMW heparin was superior to U heparin. Most trials evaluating heparins had methodological defects.\nFive trials, involving 487 patients, testing mechanical pumping devices were also methodologically flawed, and so pooled results need to be viewed cautiously. Mechanical pumping devices may protect against DVT (16/221 (7%) versus 52/229 (22%); RR 0.31; 95%CI 0.19 to 0.51) and pulmonary embolism. Data were insufficient to establish any effect on the incidence of fatal pulmonary embolism and overall mortality. Problems with skin abrasion and compliance were reported."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "U and LMW heparins protect against lower limb DVT. There is insufficient evidence to confirm either protection against pulmonary embolism or an overall benefit, or to distinguish between various applications of heparin.\nFoot and calf pumping devices appear to prevent DVT, may protect against pulmonary embolism, and reduce mortality, but compliance remains a problem.\nGood quality trials of mechanical methods as well as direct comparisons with heparin and low dose aspirin should be considered."

  "pls": "Patients with hip fracture may develop blood clots (thrombosis) in their legs. Some of these blood clots may travel to the lungs and cause a blockage (embolism), which can be fatal. Various drugs and physical devices are sometimes used to try and prevent these complications. This review of randomised trials found that both heparins and mechanical pumping devices significantly decrease the incidence of deep vein thrombosis. There was not enough evidence to conclude about the effect on lung (pulmonary) embolism, mortality or possible side effects for either heparin or mechanical methods."
