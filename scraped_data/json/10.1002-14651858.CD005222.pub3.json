One child was withdrawn prematurely from the study and another had infantile spasms and hence was excluded from further analysis. Adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH 4-9) was administered. Of the three children analysed, one showed a reduction in seizures of 25% to 50% at both the low and higher doses of corticosteroids compared to placebo; one child showed a reduction in seizures at the higher dose only and one child showed no reduction in seizures at either dose. No adverse effects were reported."

  "pls": "Background\nWe wanted to assess whether corticosteroids including ACTH are an effective treatment for children with epilepsy. Corticosteroids are sometimes used as an additional therapy to antiepileptic drugs in children with uncontrolled epilepsy. The role of corticosteroids in children with epilepsy is yet to be established.\nStudy characteristics\nThe evidence is current to August 2014. One study was included in this review. In total, data from five children, with uncontrolled seizures, aged between one and 11 years old were assessed. The duration of this study was two months; one month for the corticosteroid treatment and one month for the placebo (inactive) treatment. One of the five children was withdrawn from the study and another had epileptic spasms which meant we could not include their data in our analysis. Therefore, we were only able to compare data for three children. All three received both of the study treatments and the frequency of seizures they experienced while taking each treatment was compared.\nKey results\nOne child showed a 25% to 50% reduction in seizure frequency whilst being treated with low dose corticosteroids compared to the placebo treatment. This child plus another child both showed a 25% to 50% reduction in seizure frequency whilst being treated with the higher dose of corticosteroids compared to the placebo treatment. A third child showed no reduction in seizures with either of the doses. As only one study was found which included data from three out of five participants, further statistical analysis was not possible. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the role of corticosteroids in children with epilepsy.\nQuality of evidence\nThe evidence from the one study included in this review was rated as low quality due to the small sample size. There is a need for larger, well-designed studies."
