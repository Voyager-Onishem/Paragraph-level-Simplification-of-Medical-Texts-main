Plasma vaccine was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving hepatitis B antibodies (RR 23.0, 95% CI 14.39 to 36.76, 3 trials). We found no statistically significant difference between plasma vaccine or placebo regarding hepatitis B virus infections (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.24). We found no statistically significant differences between recombinant vaccine and plasma vaccine in achieving hepatitis B antibodies (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.53, 2 trials). Heterogeneity was significant and appeared to be attributable to the dose of vaccine. Two trials examined a reinforced recombinant vaccine strategy, which was not statistically more effective than three inoculations of recombinant vaccine regarding development of hepatitis B antibodies (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.16)."

This review was undertaken to determine the beneficial and harmful effects of vaccination against hepatitis B and of a reinforced recombinant vaccination series. None of the trials had high methodological quality. Plasma vaccine was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving hepatitis B antibodies. Yet no statistically significant difference was found between the use of plasma vaccine or placebo in preventing hepatitis B virus infections. No trials comparing recombinant vaccine with placebo were identified. There was no significant difference between recombinant and plasma vaccines or between a reinforced vaccination series and routine vaccinations of three inoculations using recombinant vaccine regarding achieving hepatitis B antibodies."
