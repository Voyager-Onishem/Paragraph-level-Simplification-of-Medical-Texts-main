We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a third review author. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model, to estimate pooled effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We assessed the quality of the evidence with GRADE methods. The primary efficacy outcome was symptom improvement on any validated symptomatic rating scale, and the primary safety outcome was adverse events."

      "text": "We included two RCTs, enrolling a total of 102 participants. Both trials evaluated the effect of DBS on the internal globus pallidus nucleus, and assessed outcomes after three and six months of stimulation. One of the studies included participants with generalised and segmental dystonia; the other included participants with focal (cervical) dystonia. We assessed both studies at high risk for performance and for-profit bias. One study was retrospectively registered with a clinical trial register, we judged the second at high risk of detection bias.\nLow-quality evidence suggests that DBS of the internal globus pallidus nucleus may improve overall cervical dystonia-related symptoms (mean difference (MD) 9.8 units, 95% CI 3.52 to 16.08 units; 1 RCT, 59 participants), cervical dystonia-related functional capacity (MD 3.8 units, 95% CI 1.41 to 6.19; 1 RCT, 61 participants), and mood at three months (MD 3.1 units, 95% CI 0.73 to 5.47; 1 RCT, 61 participants).\nLow-quality evidence suggests that In people with cervical dystonia, DBS may slightly improve the overall clinical status (MD 2.3 units, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.45; 1 RCT, 61 participants). We are uncertain whether DBS improves quality of life in cervical dystonia (MD 3 units, 95% CI -7.71 to 13.71; 1 RCT, 57 participants; very low-quality evidence), or emotional state (MD 2.4 units, 95% CI -6.2 to 11.00; 1 RCT, 56 participants; very low-quality evidence).\nLow-quality evidence suggests that DBS of the internal globus pallidus nucleus may improve generalised or segmental dystonia-related symptoms (MD 14.4 units, 95% CI 8.0 to 20.8; 1 RCT, 40 participants), overall clinical status (MD 3.5 units, 95% CI 2.33 to 4.67; 1 RCT, 37 participants), physical functioning-related quality of life (MD 6.3 units, 95% CI 1.06 to 11.54; 1 RCT, 33 participants), and overall dystonia-related functional capacity at three months (MD 3.1 units, 95% CI 1.71 to 4.48; 1 RCT, 39 participants). We are uncertain whether DBS improves physical functioning-related quality of life (MD 5.0 units, 95% CI -2.14 to 12.14, 1 RCT, 33 participants; very low-quality evidence), or mental health-related quality of life (MD -4.6 units, 95% CI -11.26 to 2.06; 1 RCT, 30 participants; very low-quality evidence) in generalised or segmental dystonia.\nWe pooled outcomes related to safety and tolerability, since both trials used the same intervention and comparison. We found very low-quality evidence of inconclusive results for risk of adverse events (relative risk (RR) 1.58, 95% 0.98 to 2.54; 2 RCTs, 102 participants), and tolerability (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.16 to 21.57; 2 RCTs,102 participants)."

We are uncertain whether the procedure improves quality of life in cervical dystonia (very low-quality evidence). We are also uncertain about the safety and tolerability of the procedure in adults with either cervical and generalised, or segmental dystonia (very-low quality evidence).\nWe could draw no conclusions for other populations with dystonia (i.e. children and adolescents, and adults with other types of dystonia), or for other DBS protocols (i.e. other target nuclei or stimulation paradigms). Further research is needed to establish the long-term efficacy and safety of DBS of the internal globus pallidus nucleus."

      "text": "Dystonia is a disease that causes undesired, uncontrollable, often painful, abnormal movement of an affected limb or body region. It is a relatively uncommon condition, which can be very disabling and negatively affect a person's quality of life. In most cases, the cause is unknown; no cure exists. Dystonia is normally a long-term disease that requires long-term treatment.\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) involves a surgical procedure to place electrical stimulators in the brain. Afterwards, the stimulators are connected to a battery, and deliver electrical impulses to the brain over time. For people with dystonia, DBS is usually considered to be a therapeutic option for severe cases only, once other treatments have failed."

We found two studies that compared DBS with sham stimulation, and included a total of 102 participants. One study included participants with dystonia of the limbs and trunk, and the other with dystonia of the neck. Participants received active DBS for a total of six months. The average age of people in the studies was 50 years; the average duration of the disease was 16 years. Both studies were funded by a DBS device manufacturer with possible interests in the results of the studies."
