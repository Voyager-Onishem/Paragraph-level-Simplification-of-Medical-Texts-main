To compare the effectiveness of different types of exercise programs on perinatal and maternal morbidity."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "Four trials, involving 114 pregnant women with gestational diabetes, were included in the review. None included pregnant women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Women were recruited during the third trimester and the intervention was performed for about six weeks. The programs generally consisted in exercising three times a week for 20 to 45 minutes. We found no significant difference between exercise and the other regimen in all the outcomes evaluated."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "There is insufficient evidence to recommend, or advise against, diabetic pregnant women to enrol in exercise programs. Further trials, with larger sample size, involving women with gestational diabetes, and possibly type 1 and 2 diabetes, are needed to evaluate this intervention.\n[Note: The six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"
