      "text": "Congenital bleeding disorders can cause obstetric haemorrhage during pregnancy, labour and following delivery. Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) is found to be an effective drug which can reduce the risk of haemorrhage and can also stop bleeding in certain congenital bleeding disorders. Its use in pregnancy has been controversial. Hence beneficial and adverse effects of DDAVP in these groups of pregnant women should be evaluated.\nThis is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013 and updated in 2015."

      "text": "No randomised controlled trials were identified investigating the relative effectiveness of DDAVP for bleeding during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders. In the absence of high-quality evidence, clinicians need to use their clinical judgement and lower level evidence (e.g. from observational trials) to decide whether or not to treat women with congenital bleeding disorders with DDAVP.\nGiven the ethical considerations, future randomised controlled trials are unlikely. However, other high-quality controlled studies (such as risk allocation designs, sequential design, parallel cohort design) to investigate the risks and benefits of using DDAVP in this population are needed.\nGiven that there are unlikely to be any trials published in this area, this review will no longer be regularly updated."

      "text": "Congenital bleeding disorders cause problems with bleeding during pregnancy, labour and delivery. Bleeding complications in women with congenital bleeding disorders are an important cause of disease and death linked to childbirth. Agents to stop the flow of blood are used for women with these bleeding disorders during pregnancy. DDAVP is a drug used to effectively increase the concentration of factor VIII in the blood and to increase the clumping together of platelets to stop bleeding. It does not come from human plasma and it carries no risk of infection. It might be a precious resource in people with von Willebrand disease, haemophilia A or congenital platelet disorders to prevent and treat bleeding episodes related to pregnancy."

Evidence is needed to show the risks and benefits of DDAVP when used to prevent and treat bleeding during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders. While there is evidence from observational trials that shows the drug is effective in stopping and preventing bleeding, we conclude that there is still a need to generate other high-quality controlled evidence. Given that there are unlikely to be any trials published in this area, this review will no longer be regularly updated."
