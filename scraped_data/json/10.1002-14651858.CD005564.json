Total failure at day 28 for artemether-lumefantrine was lower when compared with amodiaquine (270 participants, 1 trial), amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (507 participants, 1 trial), but not with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (201 participants, 2 trials). In comparisons with artemisinin derivative combinations, artemether-lumefantrine performed better than amodiaquine plus artesunate (668 participants, 2 trials), worse than mefloquine plus artesunate (270 participants, 4 trials), and no differently to dihydroartemisinin-napthoquine-trimethoprim (89 participants, 1 trial)."

It affects millions of people worldwide, and causes significant illness and mortality. Uncomplicated malaria presents with symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle pain, and vomiting. The parasite has become resistant to a number of previously effective drugs, and so combinations of drugs are used to try increase cure and to prevent further resistance. Artemether-lumefantrine is one such drug combination. This review of trials showed that the six-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine was associated with high cure rates and was more effective that most other drug combinations used for uncomplicated malaria. Further research is needed to properly assess adverse outcomes."
