      "text": "We included six studies with 350 participants followed for at least three months. All of these studies enrolled participants undergoing total knee replacement. Studies were at least partially blinded. Three studies had a high risk of performance bias and one a high risk of attrition bias, but the risk of bias was otherwise unclear or low.\nOnly one study assessed joint function using a global score. Due to heterogeneity in outcome and reporting, we could only pool three out of six RCTs, with range of motion assessed at three months after surgery used as a surrogate for joint function. All studies had a high risk of detection bias. Using the random-effects model, there was no statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups (mean difference 3.99 degrees, 95% confidence interval (CI) − 2.23 to 10.21; P value = 0.21, 3 studies, 140 participants, very low quality evidence).\nWe did not perform further analyses because immediate adverse effects were not part of the explicit outcomes of any of these typically small studies, and long-term adverse events after regional anaesthesia are rare.\nNone of the included studies elicited or reported long-term adverse effects like persistent nerve damage."

Does this choice improve long-term function after elective major joint (knee, shoulder and hip) replacement?

      "text": "People undergo knee, shoulder and hip joint replacement to improve their mobility, pain and function. Local anaesthetics are injected near the nerves or the surgical site to decrease pain after surgery. Regional analgesia has been shown to lead to better surgical results (joint range of motion, strength, ability to walk, climb stairs, etc.) in the days immediately after surgery. It is unclear whether this effect lasts beyond three months."

      "text": "We do not have enough information to determine if regional anaesthesia improves function after major joint replacement or not. We need more and better clinical trials to decide whether there is an effect of regional analgesia on the surgical results after total shoulder, hip or knee replacement surgery. We need more research to understand if regional analgesia increases the risk of falls after joint replacement."
