      "text": "We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and form of silver acetate, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up.\nThe main outcome measure was biochemically validated abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. Subjects lost to follow-up were counted as continuing smokers. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model."

    {
      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "Two studies provided long-term follow-up data on patients randomised to silver acetate or placebo. In one of these studies, there was a third arm, randomised to 2mg nicotine gum. The pooled risk ratio for quitting for silver acetate vs placebo was 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.57)."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Existing trials show little evidence for a specific effect of silver acetate in promoting smoking cessation. The confidence intervals for the ratio are quite wide. However, the upper limit of the confidence intervals for a positive effect equates to an absolute increase in the smoking cessation rate of about 4%. Any effect of this agent is therefore likely to be smaller than nicotine replacement therapy. The lack of effect of silver acetate may reflect poor compliance with a treatment whose rationale is to create an unpleasant stimulus."

  "pls": "Silver acetate products (gum, lozenge, and spray) produce an unpleasant metallic taste when combined with cigarettes, so they are used as a form of aversion therapy for smoking. However, the review of trials found little evidence to show that silver acetate helps smokers quit. Any beneficial effect of silver acetate is likely to be very small, and less than the effect already proven for nicotine replacement therapy."
