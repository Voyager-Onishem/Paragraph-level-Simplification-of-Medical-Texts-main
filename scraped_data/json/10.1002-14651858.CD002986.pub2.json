      "text": "Six studies were selected for inclusion (106 participants). No results were combined as the studies were all of a crossover design.\nEFFECTS OF NEGATIVE ION GENERATORS (five studies)\nNo study reported a significant difference in lung function between ionised and control air (morning Peak expiratory flow (PEF) - three studies; forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV1) - one study). There were no significant differences in symptoms or beta-2 agonist usage between ionised and control air in three studies.\nEFFECTS OF POSITIVE ION GENERATORS (one study)\nThis study demonstrated that although positively ionised air was associated with a larger fall in FEV1 with exercise, this did not reach statistical significance. Baseline FEV1 was not demonstrated to be significantly different between treatment groups."

Although complex laboratory studies show that ion generators alter airways function, the few studies which have been conducted in the homes of people with asthma, demonstrate no significant benefit in improving lung function or symptoms."
