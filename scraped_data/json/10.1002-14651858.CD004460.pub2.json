      "text": "This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 2, 2006.\nAllergic rhinitis represents a global health problem. Non-specific nasal hyper-responsiveness is an important feature of allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. This phenomenon is believed to result from the effect of allergic inflammation on the sensory nerves that supply the upper airway mucosa. A pharmacological agent that has proved useful in the investigation of effects of neuronal stimulation is capsaicin, the pungent component of hot pepper. Intranasal capsaicin specifically stimulates afferent nerves consisting mostly of unmyelinated C fibers and some myelinated A-delta fibers. As a result it can trigger central and axonal reflexes, the latter being putatively mediated by the release of neuropeptides. Capsaicin, as a blocking agent of neuropeptides, blocks the axon reflex and may exert a curative effect on allergic rhinitis."

  "pls": "Allergic rhinitis is a common health problem affecting between 10% and 25% of the population, and its prevalence is increasing. The symptoms include a running or blocked nose, itching and sneezing. Several drug therapies are available including antihistamines and steroids. Capsaicin, which is the pungent component of hot pepper, has also been used. With repeated doses applied topically it may desensitize the lining of the nose and have a therapeutic effect on allergic rhinitis. The review found one small, low quality randomized controlled trial which did not demonstrate a therapeutic effect of capsaicin on allergic rhinitis symptoms. Further trials are needed."
