For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD)."

One trial found no significant difference between quetiapine and haloperidol for the outcome of 'less than 50% reduction in PANSS score' (n=180, RR 0.91 CI 0.8 to 1.0). Those allocated sulpiride had significantly lower depression scores compared with people given chlorpromazine (1 RCT, n=36, WMD CPRS -0.70 CI -1.2 to -0.2). Again, however, in the quetiapine versus haloperidol comparison, the continuous scoring did not highlight differences (1 RCT, n=180, WMD PANSS depression change -0.57 CI -1.4 to 0.30). When clozapine was compared with any other antipsychotic drug plus an antidepressant or placebo, clozapine constantly scored better on Hamilton scores (1 RCT, n=29, WMD vs antipsychotic + mianserin -5.53 CI -8.23 to -2.8; 1 RCT, n=32, WMD vs antipsychotic + meclobemide -4.35 CI -6.7 to -2.03; 1 RCT, n=33, WMD vs antipsychotic + placebo -6.35 CI -8.6 to -4.1)."

  "pls": "It is well known that depression occurs in people with schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotics are used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia but their specific effects on those with schizophrenia and depression are unclear, although they are marketed for this purpose.\nIn this review we evaluated the effects of atypical antipsychotics for people with both schizophrenia and depression and unfortunately found a distinct lack of information. We wanted to assess the available evidence to ascertain whether atypical antipsychotic drugs represent a better alternative than older neuroleptic medications [plus or minus adjunctive antidepressant therapy] for people with both depression and schizophrenia. However, due to the paucity of trials of antipsychotic drugs that are sold as also having antidepressant effects, we were unable to draw any firm conclusions. More well-conducted randomised controlled trials are needed."
