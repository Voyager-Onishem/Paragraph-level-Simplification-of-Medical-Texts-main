      "text": "Nineteen studies of 2033 initially randomly assigned participants were included, of which 11 used a second injected agent, five used a mechanical method (haemoclips) and three employed thermal methods.\nThe risk of further bleeding after initial haemostasis was lower in the combination therapy groups than in the epinephrine alone group, regardless of which second procedure was applied (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.81). Adding any second procedure significantly reduced the overall bleeding rate (persistent and recurrent bleeding) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.76) and the need for emergency surgery (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.93). Mortality rates were not significantly different when either method was applied.\nRebleeding in the 10 studies that scheduled a reendoscopy showed no difference between epinephrine and combined therapy; without second-look endoscopy, a statistically significant difference was observed between epinephrine and epinephrine and any second endoscopic method, with fewer participants rebleeding in the combined therapy group (nine studies) (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.48).\nFor ulcers of the Forrest Ia or Ib type (oozing or spurting), the addition of a second therapy significantly reduced the rebleeding rate (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.88); this difference was not seen for type IIa (visible vessel) or type IIb (adherent clot) ulcers. Few procedure-related adverse effects were reported, and this finding was not statistically significantly different between groups. Few adverse events occurred, and no statistically significant difference was noted between groups.\nThe addition of a second injected method reduced recurrent and persistent rebleeding rates and surgery rates in the combination therapy group, but these findings were not statistically significantly different. Significantly fewer participants died in the combined therapy group (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.00).\nEpinephrine and a second mechanical method decreased recurrent and persistent bleeding (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.54) and the need for emergency surgery (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.62) but did not affect mortality rates.\nEpinephrine plus thermal methods decreased the rebleeding rate (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.78) and the surgery rate (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.62) but did not affect the mortality rate.\nOur risk of bias estimates show that risk of bias was low, as, although the type of study did not allow a double-blind trial, rebleeding, surgery and mortality were not dependent on subjective observation. Although some studies had limitations in their design or implementation, most were clear about important quality criteria, including randomisation and allocation concealment, sequence generation and blinding."

      "text": "Additional endoscopic treatment after epinephrine injection reduces further bleeding and the need for surgery in patients with high-risk bleeding peptic ulcer. The main adverse events include risk of perforation and gastric wall necrosis, the rates of which were low in our included studies and favoured neither epinephrine therapy nor combination therapy. The main conclusion is that combined therapy seems to work better than epinephrine alone. However, we cannot conclude that a particular form of treatment is equal or superior to another."

      "text": "Peptic ulcers develop when the usual protective mechanism of the body breaks down and digestive juices produced in the stomach, intestines and digestive glands damage the lining of the stomach or duodenum. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori are common causes of ulcers.\nWhen ulcers in the stomach and small intestine (duodenum) start to bleed extensively (haemorrhage), the bleeding can be life threatening and requires emergency treatment.\nPatients undergo an endoscopy so clinicians can locate the source of bleeding. Active bleeding or non-bleeding visible blood vessels at endoscopy are deemed 'high risk,' in that further bleeding may occur even if the initial haemorrhage can be stopped. Once the source of bleeding has been identified, endoscopic therapy reduces rebleeding rate, need for surgery and deaths. Endoscopic therapy consists of an agent to stop the bleeding, which is injected into the bleeding area; epinephrine (adrenaline) is the most popular agent. Experts disagree on the need for a second procedure such as bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, sclerosant or clips immediately after epinephrine; although it seems to reduce further bleeding, the effects of a second procedure on continuing illness (morbidity), surgery rates and death remain unclear."
