      "text": "Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm causes aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, which is one of the most devastating clinical conditions. It can be classified into five Grades using the Hunt-Hess or World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) scale. Grades 4 and 5 predict poor prognosis and are known as 'poor grade', while grade 1, 2, and 3 are known as 'good grade'. Disturbances of intracranial homeostasis and brain metabolism are known to play certain roles in the sequelae. Hypothermia has a long history of being used to reduce metabolic rate, thereby protecting organs where metabolism is disturbed, and may potentially cause harm."

      "text": "We included three studies, enrolling 1158 participants. Each study reported an increased rate of recovery with intraoperative mild hypothermia, but the effect sizes were not sufficient for certainty. A total of 1086 of the 1158 participants (93.8%) had good grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Seventy-six of 577 participants (13.1%) who received hypothermia and 93 of 581 participants (16.0%) who did not receive hypothermia were dead or dependent (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; RD -0.03; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.01, moderate-quality evidence) after three months.\nReported unfavourable outcomes did not differ between participants with or without hypothermia. The quality of evidence for these outcomes remains unclear because the outcomes were reported in a variety of ways. No decompressive craniectomy or corticectomy was reported. Thirty-six of 577 (6.2%) participants with hypothermia and 40 of 581 (6.9%) participants without hypothermia had infarction. Thirty-four of 577 (6%) participants with hypothermia and 32 of the 581 (5.5%) participants without hypothermia had clinical vasospasm (temporary deficits).\nDuration of hospital stay was not reported. Only one study with 112 participants reported discharge destinations: 43 of 55 (78.2%) participants with hypothermia and 39 of 57 (68.4%) participants in the control group were discharged home. The remaining participants were discharged to other facilities.\nThirty-nine of 577 (6.8%) participants with hypothermia and 39 of 581 (6.7%) participants without hypothermia had infections. Six of 577 (1%) participants with hypothermia and 6 of 581 (1%) participants without hypothermia had cardiac arrhythmia."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "It remains possible that intraoperative mild hypothermia could prevent death or dependency in activities of daily living in people with good grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. However, the confidence intervals around this estimate include the possibility of both benefit and harm. There was insufficient information to draw any conclusions about the effects of intraoperative mild hypothermia in people with poor grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage or without subarachnoid haemorrhage. We did not identify any reliable evidence to support the routine use of intraoperative mild hypothermia. A high-quality randomised clinical trial of intraoperative mild hypothermia for postoperative neurological deficits in people with poor grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage might be feasible."

People with intracranial aneurysms are classified as good grade or poor grade, based on their clinical manifestations. Surgery is a common option to treat this problem, but it can cause further damage to the brain. Theoretically, cooling the brain reduces its metabolic activity, thus protecting it during an operation. Research on animals supports this theory in general."

The evidence for other outcomes was more uncertain, since we could not combine the data due to variation in the definition and reporting of outcome data. Data in our analyses were primarily from one high quality trial on good grade participants."
