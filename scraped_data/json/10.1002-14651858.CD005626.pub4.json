      "text": "Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) that is characterised by pain, swelling, and skin changes in the affected limb. One in three patients with DVT will develop post-thrombotic sequelae within five years. The current standard care for the prevention of PTS following DVT is elastic compression stockings. Rutosides are a group of compounds derived from horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), a traditional herbal remedy for treating oedema formation in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). However, it is not known whether rutosides are effective and safe in the prevention of PTS. This is the second update of the review first published in 2013."

      "text": "As there were no studies identified in this review there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of rutosides for prevention of PTS in patients with DVT. Some studies suggest that rutosides may provide short-term relief of PTS symptoms. However, there is nothing published on their use as a preventative therapy for PTS. High quality randomised controlled trials of rutoside versus any alternative are required to build the evidence base in this area."

      "text": "Blood clots in the veins of the leg are a common problem and are termed deep vein thrombosis (DVT). One in three patients with a DVT develops a complication known as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). This syndrome involves ongoing swelling of the affected leg, pain, and also skin changes. At the current time the main way of preventing PTS is to wear compression stockings. However, it is known that patients frequently find the stocking uncomfortable and would prefer to take an oral medication to prevent the problem.\nRutosides are a herbal remedy which have been shown to reduce swelling and skin changes in other conditions affecting the veins such as in chronic venous insufficiency. This review aimed to evaluate the existing literature to see if there was evidence from randomised controlled trials for the effectiveness of rutosides in preventing PTS following a DVT. We also aimed to investigate whether there were any side effects from the treatment."
