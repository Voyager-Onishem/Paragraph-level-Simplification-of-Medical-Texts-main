      "text": "Four updating strategies, one technique, and two statistical methods were identified. Three strategies addressed steps for updating and one strategy presented a model for assessing the need to update. One technique discussed the use of the \"entry date\" field in bibliographic searching. Statistical methods were cumulative meta-analysis and predicting when meta-analyses are outdated."

It is not clear, however, when updating should be done and which strategies and methods are most cost-effectiveThis review identified strategies and methods used to update systematic reviews. Fifteen articles that documented 4 strategies and 2 statistical methods for updating systematic reviews were found. The 4 strategies have not been compared to one another so their practical performances are unclear.\nLittle research has been conducted on when and how to update systematic reviews and the feasibility and efficiency of the identified approaches is uncertain. These shortcomings should be addressed in future research."
