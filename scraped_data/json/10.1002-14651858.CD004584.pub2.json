      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "Tongxinluo capsules are a compound of Chinese traditional medicine which contain substances that are thought to have vasodilatory, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, thrombolytic and even lipid-lowering properties, and therefore may improve outcome after acute ischaemic stroke. To date the evidence of its effect has not been systematically reviewed, making it difficult to derive robust conclusions about its actual benefits, and indeed, possible harms."

We handsearched 30 journals (1995 to 2006), and contacted drug companies and the principal of included trials."

      "text": "Only two poor quality studies with a total of 232 participants were included in this review. Neither study reported any of our pre-specified outcomes, so no reliable estimate of the effect of treatment on major clinical outcomes could be obtained."

  "pls": "Traditional Chinese medicine is often used to treat patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The authors undertook a systematic review of the potential benefits and safety of tongxinluo capsule used for the treatment of patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Two relevant studies with a total of 232 participants were identified, but they did not provide reliable evidence about the effects of this treatment. Larger-scale high quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine the effects of tongxinluo capsule in patients with stroke."
