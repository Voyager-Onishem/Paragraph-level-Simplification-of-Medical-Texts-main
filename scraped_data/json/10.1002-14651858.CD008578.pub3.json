      "text": "Two review authors independently evaluated trial quality and conducted data extraction. We contacted the trial authors for missing data regarding participant allocation. Some trials allocated participants according to the participants' admission sequence, making it a pseudo-random allocation. None of the trials concealed participants' allocation or used blinding."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "We did not identify any eligible trials for inclusion. We identified 108 studies that claimed to use random allocation. We excluded 104 studies because the allocation methods the authors had used were not actually randomised. We were unable to contact the trial authors of the remaining four studies. These trials require further evaluation and have been allocated to the 'Studies awaiting classification' section."

It can range from a mild upper respiratory disease to serious complications. Herbal medicines have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as the main therapy to prevent and treat mumps for thousands of years. Many Chinese physicians believe that Chinese medicinal herbs are effective in treating mumps."

The review authors did not find any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for mumps. Although no trials were included, we reviewed the studies and found no reports of adverse events with Chinese medicinal herbs as a treatment for mumps."
