GIA is still a source of significant controversy among surgeons due to the use of variety of approaches. Adequate apposition by single layer or double layer anastomosis may affect outcome after GIA"

The particular question we would attempt to answer will be; is single layer hand made GIA in surgical patients is as effective as double layer?"

      "text": "Seven randomised, controlled trials encompassing 842 patients undergoing SGIA versus DGIA were retrieved from the electronic databases. There were 408 patients in the SGIA group and 432 patients in the DGIA group. All included studies were small, with sample sizes ranging from 60 to 172. There was no heterogeneity among the included trials. Therefore, in the fixed effects model, incidence of anastomotic dehiscence, peri-operative complications and mortality was statistically equivalent between two techniques of GIA. Average hospital stay following SGIA and DGIA was also comparable. However, SGIA was superior in terms of shorter operative time. Sensitivity analysis of relatively good quality and poor quality trials supported same conclusion."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "SGIA can be performed quicker as compared to double layer GIA. SGIA is comparable to DGIA in terms of anastomotic leak, peri-operative complications, mortality and hospital stay. SGIA may routinely be used for GIA following bowel resection. However, since this conclusion is derived from smaller number of patients recruited in relatively moderate quality trials, further trials should be aimed to reduce the limitations of this review."

  "pls": "Bowel anastomosis following resection can be performed in single layer or double layer. This review concludes that single layer anastomosis is comparable to double layer anastomosis in terms of anastomotic leak, peri-operative complications, death rate and hospital stay. Single layer anastomosis consumes shorter operative time as compared to double layer. Therefore, single layer anastomosis may routinely be used for the anastomosis of gastrointestinal tract following bowel resection. However, since this conclusion is derived from smaller number of patients recruited in relatively moderate quality trials, further trials should be aimed to reduce the limitations of this review."
