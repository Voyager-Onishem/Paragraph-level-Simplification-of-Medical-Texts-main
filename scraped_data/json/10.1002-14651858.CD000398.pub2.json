      "text": "Nitric oxide (NO) has multiple effects that may be beneficial in acute stroke, including lowering blood pressure, and promoting reperfusion and cytoprotection. Some forms of nitric oxide synthase inhibition (NOS-I) may also be beneficial. However, high concentrations of NO are likely to be toxic to brain tissue. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1998, and last updated in 2002."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "We included five completed trials, involving 4197 participants; all tested transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), an NO donor. The assessed risk of bias was low across the included studies; one study was double-blind, one open-label and three were single-blind. All included studies had blinded outcome assessment. Overall, GTN did not improve the primary outcome of death or dependency at the end of trial (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) > 2, OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.10, 4195 participants, high-quality evidence). GTN did not improve secondary outcomes, including death (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.50) and quality of life (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.15) at the end of trial overall (high-quality evidence). Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) was lower in people treated with GTN (MD -7.2 mmHg (95% CI -8.6 to -5.9) and MD -3.3 (95% CI -4.2 to -2.5) respectively) and heart rate was higher (MD 2.0 beats per minute (95% CI 1.1 to 2.9)). Headache was more common in those randomised to GTN (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.62). We did not find any trials assessing other nitrates, L-arginine, or NOS-I."

In people with acute stroke, GTN reduces blood pressure, increases heart rate and headache, but does not alter clinical outcome (all based on high-quality evidence)."

This review looked at trials that tested such drugs in people with a stroke that came on within the last few days."

We included five trials involving 4197 people; all trials assessed glyceryl trinitrate, a drug that is given as a skin patch and which releases nitric oxide. One study was international, whilst the remainder were studies performed at single centres. Not all trials contributed data to all outcomes. We used both unpublished and published information, where available. We did not find any trials assessing other nitrate drugs, L-arginine, or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors."
