Studies have shown that the rate of surgical site infection varies from 8.8% to 37.5% after liver transplantation. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis is likely an essential tool for reducing these infections. However, the literature lacks evidence indicating the best prophylactic antibiotic regimen that can be used for liver transplantation."

      "text": "The electronic search identified 786 publications after removal of duplicates. From this search, only one seemingly randomised clinical trial, published in abstract form, fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review. This trial was conducted at Shiraz Transplant Centre, Shiraz, Iran, where investigators randomly assigned a total of 180 consecutive liver transplant recipients. We judged the overall risk of bias of the trial published in abstract form as high. Researchers reported no numerical data but mentioned that 163 participants met the inclusion criteria after randomisation, and hence were included in the analyses. Most probably, the 17 excluded participants were high-risk liver transplant recipients. Trial authors concluded that they could find no differences between the two antibiotic regimens - ceftriaxone plus metronidazole versus ampicillin-sulbactam plus ceftizoxime - when given to liver transplant recipients. Review authors could not reconfirm the analyses because, as it has been mentioned, trial authors provided no trial data for analyses."

The trial reported no other numerical data and was considered at high risk of bias; the quality of the evidence was low, hence we cannot be sure of the conclusions presented by trial authors. This trial assessed ceftriaxone plus metronidazole versus ampicillin-sulbactam plus ceftizoxime. Trial authors have not responded to three email requests sent by review authors to request detailed information, but they mention that they found no differences between the two antibiotic regimens when used for prophylaxis for bacterial infection among liver transplant recipients."

Trial authors did not report on outcomes such as adverse events, time of graft survival, intensive care unit stay, total time of hospital stay nor quality of life. Although study authors seemed to report on some outcomes of interest, their reporting is ambiguous, and no data are available. Trial authors excluded high-risk patients from their analyses."
