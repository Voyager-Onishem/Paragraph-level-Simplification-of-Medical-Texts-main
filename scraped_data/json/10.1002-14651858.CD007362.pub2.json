      "text": "We included18 RCTs (n = 1321 patients). Seven trials were published as full-text papers, and 11 trials only as meeting abstracts. All the included trials had adequate methods of randomization and allocation concealment. The results suggest that, compared with placebo or neostigmine, sugammadex can more rapidly reverse rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade regardless of the depth of the block. We identified 2, 4, and 16 mg/kg of sugammadex for reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade at T2 reappearance , 1 to 2 post-tetanic counts, and 3 to 5 minutes after rocuronium, respectively. The number of trials are very limited regarding vecuronium and pancuronium. Serious adverse events occurred in < 1% of all patients who received the medication. There was no significant difference between sugammadex and placebo in terms of the prevalence of drug-related adverse events (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.37; P = 0.59, I2 = 0%, 5 RCTs). Also, no significant difference was found between sugammadex and neostigmine for adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.48 to1.98; P = 0.95, I2 = 43%, 3 RCTs)."

This review has found no evidence of a difference in the instance of unwanted effects between sugammadex, placebo or neostigmine.

  "pls_type": "long",
  "pls": "Muscle relaxation is required to facilitate some surgical procedures. If it is not completely reversed after surgery, the muscle relaxation effects might lead to remaining muscle weakness, breathing problems, lung infection and delayed recovery. Neostigmine and other medications from the same drug family are currently used to restore muscle function after surgery. These medications, however, are not effective in all situations and may cause complications as well. Complications include changes in the heart and lung function, and nausea and vomiting after surgery. Sugammadex is a new medication that is used after surgery in order to reverse the effects of muscle relaxation medications. In this review article we have included 18 trials on the efficacy and safety of sugammadex. The trials included a total of 1321 patients. Sugammadex was shown to be more effective than placebo (no medication) or neostigmine in reversing muscle relaxation caused by neuromuscular blockade during surgery and is relatively safe. Serious complications occurred in less than 1% of the patients who received sugammadex. The results of this review article (specially the safety results) need to be confirmed by future trials on larger patient populations."
