      "text": "Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition affecting 10% to 15% of reproductive-age women and may cause dyspareunia, dysmenorrhoea, and infertility. One treatment strategy is combining surgery and medical therapy to reduce the recurrence of endometriosis. Though the combination of surgery and medical therapy appears to be beneficial, there is a lack of clarity about the appropriate timing of when medical therapy should be used in relation with surgery, that is, before, after, or both before and after surgery, to maximize treatment response."

Primary outcomes were: painful symptoms of endometriosis as measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, other validated scales or dichotomous outcomes; and recurrence of disease as evidenced by EEC (Endoscopic Endometriosis Classification), rAFS (revised American Fertility Society), or rASRM (revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine) scores at second-look laparoscopy."

      "text": "Our results indicate that the data about the efficacy of medical therapy for endometriosis are inconclusive, related to the timing of hormonal suppression therapy relative to surgery for endometriosis. In our various comparisons of the timing of hormonal suppression therapy, women who receive postsurgical medical therapy compared with no medical therapy or placebo may experience benefit in terms of pain recurrence, disease recurrence, and pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence regarding hormonal suppression therapy at other time points in relation to surgery for women with endometriosis."

      "text": "In endometriosis, tissue like the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes. It affects 10% to 15% of reproductive-age women, and may cause pain in the lower tummy (pelvic pain) or back (which usually worsen during a woman's periods), painful sexual intercourse, and difficulty becoming pregnant.\nTreatment to lower the levels of reproductive hormones (called medical hormonal suppression therapy) is common to reduce the size of endometrial tissue along with surgery to cut it away. Medical therapy can reduce pain or its reappearance, reduce disease recurrence (the chance of it coming back), and improve pregnancy rate. Potential benefits of medication may depend on whether it is given before or after surgery for endometriosis, but evidence is not clear."
