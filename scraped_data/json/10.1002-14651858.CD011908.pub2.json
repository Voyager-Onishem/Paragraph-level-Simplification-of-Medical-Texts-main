      "text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus that usually affects people with reduced immunity. In recent years, this virus has been thought to cause repeated inflammation in the eye, in otherwise healthy people. This form of inflammation can cause damage to the cornea (the outer layer of the eye) or to the optic nerve by causing secondary glaucoma, or to both, leading to visual loss."

Cochrane review authors searched for all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials) but did not find any studies that could be included in the review."

      "text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus that affects the front of the eye. If the CMV infection is not treated, it can cause irreversible damage to the front of the eye or damage to the optic nerve or both. This damage can cause sight loss. Untreated, this virus has a tendency to recur, and multiple recurrences can increase the chance of developing eye problems. The treatment for this virus includes the use of eyedrops as well as tablets and injections. However, the currently available medications have side effects, so that knowing the dose and duration of treatment can help reduce these side effects, as well as reducing the risk of new episodes and of further problems."
