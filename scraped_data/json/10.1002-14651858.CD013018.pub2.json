Additional searches were conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov and on the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for any planned, ongoing and unpublished studies.\nDate of the last search: 19 March 2020."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "Two trials, involving a total of 50 participants with CF and postural abnormalities, were included in this review. One was in people with stable disease (lasting three months) and one in hospital inpatients experiencing an exacerbation (20 days). Both trials compared manual therapy comprising mobilizations to the rib cage and thoracic spine, treatment of specific muscle dysfunction or tight muscle groups; and postural awareness and education versus medical usual care. The age of participants ranged from 17 years to 58 years. Both trials were conducted in the UK.\nThe following outcomes were measured: change in quality of life, change in pain, change in trunk deformity and change in pulmonary function. Manual therapy may make little or no difference to the change in trunk deformity compared to usual care (low-quality evidence). No results could be analysed for quality of life (very low-quality evidence) and pain outcomes (very low-quality evidence) because of the high heterogeneity between trials. It is uncertain whether the intervention improves lung function: forced vital capacity (very low-quality evidence); forced expiratory volume in one second (very low-quality evidence); or Tiffeneauâ€™s index (ratio of forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC)). Only one trial (15 participants) measured functional capacity, and the change in walked distance seemed to favour intervention over usual care, but with the possibility of no effect due to wide confidence intervals. The same trial also reported that six participants in the intervention group had positive comments about the intervention and no adverse events were mentioned."

    {
      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Due to methodological limitations in the included trials, and in addition to the very low to low quality of the current evidence, there is limited evidence about the benefits of physical therapies on postural abnormalities in people with CF. Therefore, further well-conducted trials with robust methodologies are required considering a prior inclusion criterion to identify the participants who have postural abnormalities."

Recently, it has been noticed that postural abnormalities may happen because of the disease progression. Some physical therapies that promote the stretching and strengthening of the muscles connected to the spine may help improving the pain and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis."

The trials compared manual therapy (all physical therapies that promote relaxation of the muscles, as well as mobilization of the spine, such as massage, spinal mobilization) with usual care (the normal treatment they used to receive). Participants were placed in each treatment group at random. One trial was in hospital inpatients and lasted 20 days and the second was in outpatients and lasted three months. Most of the outcomes were reported in both trials."

    {
      "heading": "Key results",
      "text": "The trials did not find any difference between manual therapy and usual care for changes in trunk deformity. We could not combine results for quality of life or pain scores because they were too different. We were not able to find a difference between manual therapy and usual care for lung function. Only one trial (15 participants) measured the change in walked distance which seemed to favour manual therapy over usual care, but this was not clear because there were a large range of results. One trial reported that participants from the manual therapy group enjoyed the type of the treatment they received and that adherence was also high. None of the trials reported any side effects."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Quality of the evidence",
      "text": "Overall, there was only low- to very low-quality of evidence in all outcomes considered. Low-quality evidence means that our confidence in the effect of manual therapy is limited and the true effect may be very different. We think the fact that people knew which treatment they were receiving can affect the results for the change in quality of life, change in pain and change in lung function outcomes, but this may not affect the other outcomes. Therefore, we are still not confident that manual therapies improve outcomes that we consider important for the treatment of postural abnormalities."
