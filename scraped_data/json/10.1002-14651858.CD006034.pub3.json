      "text": "Heavy menstrual bleeding and pain are common reasons women discontinue intrauterine device (IUD) use. Copper IUD (Cu IUD) users tend to experience increased menstrual bleeding, whereas levonorgestrel IUD (LNG IUD) users tend to have irregular menstruation. Medical therapies used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with Cu and LNG IUD use include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti-fibrinolytics and paracetamol. We analysed treatment and prevention interventions separately because the expected outcomes for treatment and prevention interventions differ. We did not combine different drug classes in the analysis as they have different mechanisms of action. This is an update of a review originally on NSAIDs. The review scope has been widened to include all interventions for treatment or prevention of heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with IUD use."

      "text": "This review includes 21 trials involving 3689 participants from middle- and high-income countries. Women were 18 to 45 years old and either already using an IUD or had just had one placed for contraception. The included trials examined NSAIDs and other interventions. Eleven were treatment trials, of these seven were on users of the Cu IUD, one on LNG IUD and three on an unknown type. Ten were prevention trials, six focused on Cu IUD users, and four on LNG IUD users. Sixteen trials had high risk of detection bias due to subjective assessment of pain and bleeding.\nTreatment of heavy menstrual bleeding\nCu IUD\nVitamin B1 resulted in fewer pads used per day (mean difference (MD) −7.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) −8.50 to −5.50) and fewer bleeding days (MD −2.00, 95% CI –2.38 to −1.62; 1 trial; 110 women; low-certainty evidence) compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of naproxen on the volume of menstruation compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.09, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.78; 1 trial, 40 women; very low-certainty evidence).\nTreatment with mefenamic acid resulted in less volume of blood loss compared to tranexamic acid (MD −64.26, 95% CI −105.65 to −22.87; 1 trial, 94 women; low-certainty evidence). However, there was no difference in duration of bleeding with treatment of mefenamic acid or tranexamic acid (MD 0.08 days, 95% CI −0.27 to 0.42, 2 trials, 152 women; low-certainty evidence).\nLNG IUD\nThe use of ulipristal acetate in LNG IUD may not reduce the number of bleeding days in 90 days in comparison to placebo (MD −9.30 days, 95% CI −26.76 to 8.16; 1 trial, 24 women; low-certainty evidence).\nUnknown IUD type\nMefenamic acid may not reduce volume of bleeding compared to Vitex agnus measured by pictorial blood assessment chart (MD −2.40, 95% CI −13.77 to 8.97; 1 trial; 84 women; low-certainty evidence).\nTreatment of pain\nCu IUD\nTreatment with tranexamic acid and sodium diclofenac may result in little or no difference in the occurrence of pain (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 17.25; 1 trial, 38 women; very low-certainty evidence).\nUnknown IUD type\nNaproxen may reduce pain (MD 4.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 7.29; 1 trial, 33 women; low-certainty evidence).\nPrevention of heavy menstrual bleeding\nCu IUD\nWe found very low-certainty evidence that tolfenamic acid may prevent heavy bleeding compared to placebo (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.85; 1 trial, 310 women). There was no difference between ibuprofen and placebo in blood volume reduction (MD −14.11, 95% CI −36.04 to 7.82) and duration of bleeding (MD −0.2 days, 95% CI −1.40 to 1.0; 1 trial, 28 women, low-certainty evidence).\nAspirin may not prevent heavy bleeding in comparison to paracetamol (MD −0.30, 95% CI −26.16 to 25.56; 1 trial, 20 women; very low-certainty evidence).\nLNG IUD\nUlipristal acetate may increase the percentage of bleeding days compared to placebo (MD 9.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 17.52; 1 trial, 118 women; low-certainty evidence). There were insufficient data for analysis in a single trial comparing mifepristone and vitamin B.\nThere were insufficient data for analysis in the single trial comparing tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid and in another trial comparing naproxen with estradiol.\nPrevention of pain\nCu IUD\nThere was low-certainty evidence that tolfenamic acid may not be effective to prevent painful menstruation compared to placebo (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.14; 1 trial, 310 women). Ibuprofen may not reduce menstrual cramps compared to placebo (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 8.95; 1 trial, 20 women, low-certainty evidence)."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Findings from this review should be interpreted with caution due to low- and very low-certainty evidence. Included trials were limited; the majority of the evidence was derived from single trials with few participants. Further research requires larger trials and improved trial reporting. The use of vitamin B1 and mefenamic acid to treat heavy menstruation and tolfenamic acid to prevent heavy menstruation associated with Cu IUD should be investigated. More trials are needed to generate evidence for the treatment and prevention of heavy and painful menstruation associated with LNG IUD."

As for levonorgestrel IUD users, ulipristal may not reduce or prevent heavy menstrual bleeding. Tolfenamic acid may prevent heavy menstrual bleeding but not pain associated with levonorgestrel IUD. Our confidence in the evidence is low to very low. More studies are needed in the future to generate higher-quality evidence regarding effective medicines to treat and prevent heavy menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation associated with IUD use. Evidence from further studies is likely to change our results."
