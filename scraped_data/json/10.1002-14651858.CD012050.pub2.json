      "text": "There are approximately 24 million people worldwide with dementia; this is likely to increase to 81 million by 2040. Dementia is a progressive condition, and usually leads to death eight to ten years after first symptoms. End-of-life care should emphasise treatments that optimise quality of life and physicians should minimise unnecessary or non-beneficial interventions. Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors; they have become the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for the management of hypercholesterolaemia but their ability to provide benefit is unclear in the last weeks or months of life. Withdrawal of statins may improve quality of life in people with advanced dementia, as they will not be subjected to unnecessary polypharmacy or side effects. However, they may help to prevent further vascular events in people of advanced age who are at high risk of such events."

      "text": "Dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) is a global healthcare concern; there are approximately 24 million people worldwide with dementia, and this is likely to increase to 81 million by 2040. Dementia is a slowly progressing condition, and persons affected may experience a gradual decline over eight to ten years. Medications that are appropriately prescribed when someone has mild dementia may no longer be appropriate as dementia progresses to severe. Statins are prescribed to lower cholesterol levels in the blood; in most cases, they help prevent myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) or strokes, but the benefits are only seen after using them for a period of months or years. They have well known side-effects, such as muscle pain, and it is not known if the benefits of these medications outweigh the risks in persons with advanced dementia."
