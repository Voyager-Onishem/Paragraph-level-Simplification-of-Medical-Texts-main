      "text": "Five trials (n=346) examining IA steroid injection in the knee joint were included. It was not possible to pool data as outcome measures, timing of follow up and the methods of data reporting differed between trials. There was inconclusive conflicting evidence from two trials that walking time was reduced. There was evidence from one moderate quality trial that pain was reduced at 1-day post-injection (0-100 VAS from 28.33 to 13.46; McGill Pain Scale from 8.89 to 3.96) but not at 1 week or 7-12 weeks post-injection. There is some evidence that IA injections improved knee flexion (by 14 degrees) and reduced knee extension lag (by 20 degrees), knee circumference (median reduction = 0.3 cm) and morning stiffness (reduced from 60 mins to 7.6 mins). One trial (n=91) examined the effects of rest following injection in the knee. The rested group achieved significant improvement in pain, stiffness, knee circumference, and walking time when compared with the non-rested group (no point estimates provided). One trial evaluated rest following injection of the wrist (n=117). Relapse rate was higher in the rested group (rest relapse rate = 24/58, no-rest group = 14/59); but there were no differences between the rested and non-rested groups on pain, joint circumference, wrist function, grip strength or ROM."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "There is some evidence to support the use of IA steroid injections and resting a knee following injections but that wrists should not be rested following injections. The included studies involved adult participants so any conclusions can only cautiously applied to children. Further research is required to examine the use and type of rest and the differential responses of different joints following injections."

      "heading": "Do intra-articular steroid injections work for treating rheumatoid arthritis and should people rest after the injections?",
      "text": "Seven moderate quality studies were reviewed and provide the best evidence we have today. The studies tested 346 adults with rheumatoid arthritis. They compared people who had a steroid injection, a fake injection or aspiration/washout of their knees or wrists to each other. Two studies tested whether people should rest their joints after injections.What is rheumatoid arthritis and how might steroid injections help?\nRheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own healthy tissues. The attack happens mostly in the joints of the hands and feet and causes redness, pain, swelling and heat around the joints. Intra-articular steroid injections into a joint can be used to decrease pain and swelling quickly. People may have steroid injections to delay starting steroid pills or arthritis drugs, or when drugs are not controlling pain enough. It is not clear if steroid injections work and if people should rest their joints after injections."

      "heading": "What did the studies show?",
      "text": "One of two studies show that people who had steroid injections had less pain the first day than people who had fake injections.\nPain decreased by about 15 points on a 0-100 scale with a steroid injection and 7 points with a fake injection.\nThe change in pain, however, was the same after 1 or 7 to 12 weeks with or without steroid injections.\nStudies show that people who had steroid injections could bend and straighten their leg better/farther and had less swelling around their knee than people with fake injections. Morning stiffness also did not last as long with steroid injections. But one study shows that people could walk faster with steroid injections while another study shows they could not."

      "text": "The level of quality of the evidence is 'silver'. Intra-articular steroid injections can improve pain, movement, stiffness and swelling and are safe in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. There is no evidence to say whether this is true for children.\nKnees should be rested after a steroid injection, but wrists should not."
