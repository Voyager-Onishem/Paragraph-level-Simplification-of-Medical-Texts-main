      "text": "Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a non-atherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory pathology that most commonly affects the small- and medium-sized arteries, veins, and nerves in the upper and lower extremities. The etiology is unknown, but involves hereditary susceptibility, tobacco exposure, immune and coagulation responses. In many cases, there is no possibility of revascularization to improve the condition. Stem cell therapy is an option for patients with severe complications, such as ischemic ulcers or rest pain."

      "text": "We only included one RCT (18 participants with thromboangiitis obliterans) comparing the implantation of stem cell derived from bone marrow with placebo and standard wound dressing care in this review. We identified no studies that compared stem cell therapy (bone marrow source) versus stem cell therapy (umbilical cord source), stem cell therapy (any source) versus pharmacological treatment and stem cell therapy (any source) versus sympathectomy. Ulcer healing was assessed in the form of ulcer size. The mean ulcer area decreased more in the stem cell implantation group: from 5.04 cm2 (standard deviation (SD) 0.70) to 1.48 cm2 (SD 0.56) compared with the control group: mean ulcer size area decreased from 4.68 cm2 (SD 0.62) to 3.59 cm2 (SD 0.14); mean difference (MD) -2.11 cm2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.49 to -1.73; 1 study, 18 participants; very low-quality evidence. Pain-free walking distance showed more of an improvement in the stem cell implantation group: from mean of 38.33 meters (SD 17.68) to 284.44 meters (SD 212.12) compared with the control group: mean walking distance increased from 35.66 meters (SD 19.79) to 78.22 meters (SD 35.35); MD 206.22 meters, 95% CI 65.73 to 346.71; 1 study; 18 participants; very low-quality evidence.\nOutcomes such as rate of amputation, pain, amputation-free survival and adverse effects were not assessed.\nThe quality of evidence was classified as very low, with only one study, small numbers of participants, high risk of bias in many domains and missing information regarding tobacco exposure status."

      "text": "Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a condition characterized by recurring progressive inflammation and clotting in small- and medium-sized arteries and veins of the hands and feet. Its cause is unknown, but it is most common in men with a history of tobacco use. It is responsible for ulcers and extreme pain in the limbs of young smokers. In many cases, mainly in patients with the most severe form, there is no possibility of improving the condition with surgery, and therefore, alternative treatments are used. Stem cell therapy is an experimental treatment performed through the implantation of cells (from bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood etc.) which are capable of becoming new blood vessels, improving local circulation and contributing to the healing of ulcers and relieving rest pain. This review assessed the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in the treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease)."

We identified no studies that compared stem cell therapy from different sources, stem cell therapy versus drug treatment and stem cell therapy versus sympathectomy (surgical cutting of a sympathetic nerve). The results showed a decrease in ulcer size and improvement in pain-free walking distance in the group receiving the stem cell implantation compared with the group receiving placebo and standard wound dressing care.\nOutcomes such as rate of amputation, pain, amputation-free survival and adverse effects were not assessed."
