This involved identifying eligible RCTs and extracting aggregate data from the abstracts or reports of these RCTs. Hazard ratios were calculated from published summary statistics and then combined to give pooled estimates of treatment efficacy."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "Twelve eligible RCTs were identified. Data were available from seven RCTs including 988 patients (75% of eligible patients). Pre-operative chemotherapy increased survival with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (95%CI 0.69-0.97) P = 0.022. This is equivalent to an absolute benefit of 6%, increasing overall survival across all stages of disease from 14% to 20% at 5 years. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.980, I2 = 0)."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "This analysis shows a significant increase in survival attributable to pre-operative chemotherapy. This is currently the best estimate of the effectiveness of this therapy, but is based on a small number of trials and patients. This analysis was unable to address important questions such as whether particular types of patients may benefit more or less from pre-operative chemotherapy or whether the early stopping of a number of included RCTs impacted on the results. These issues may be addressed by an ongoing individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis."

  "pls": "The results of this systematic review suggest that pre-operative chemotherapy might increase survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer when compared to surgery alone. However, an individual patient data systematic review and meta-analysis is needed to give us a more reliable assessment of the size of benefits and to explore whether pre-operative chemotherapy may be more or less effective for particular types of patients."
