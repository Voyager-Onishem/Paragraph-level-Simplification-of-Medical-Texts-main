Recurrent apnoea episodes are correlated with adverse neurological development in this population. Carnitine deficiency has been shown to be associated with apnoea and respiratory failure in infants and in adults. The review authors investigated whether treatment of premature babies with carnitine will help in the reduction or resolution of apnoea episodes, and the need for ventilation. No treatment trials were identified."
