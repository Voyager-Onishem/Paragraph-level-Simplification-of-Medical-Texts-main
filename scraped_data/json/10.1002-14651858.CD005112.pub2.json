      "heading": "Data collection and analysis",
      "text": "Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of each study were independently performed by two reviewers. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of remission as defined by the primary studies. Other endpoints were clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement as defined by the primary studies; improvement in quality of life as measured by a validated quality of life tool and the occurrence of adverse events."

      "text": "Seven randomised controlled trials were identified that satisfied the inclusion criteria. In patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease was refractory to conventional treatment using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, infliximab (three intravenous infusions at 0, 2, and 6 weeks) was more effective than placebo in inducing clinical remission (Relative Risk (RR) 3.22, 95% CI 2.18 to 4.76); inducing endoscopic remission (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.28); and in inducing clinical response (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.41) at 8 weeks. A single infusion of infliximab was also more effective than placebo in reducing the need for colectomy within 90 days after infusion (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.87)."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "In patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease is refractory to conventional treatment using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, infliximab is effective in inducing clinical remission, inducing clinical response, promoting mucosal healing, and reducing the need for colectomy at least in the short term. Serious adverse events attributable to infliximab were not common in the included studies but physicians should be aware of and be prepared to deal with potential adverse events such as anaphylactic reactions and infections."

  "pls": "Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disorder of the large bowel. Although corticosteroids are effective for treating ulcerative colitis, approximately 20% of patients who respond become sick again when steroids are withdrawn and become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a proinflammatory cykotine that is involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis. TNF- α blocking drugs may provide an alternative treatment for patients who do not respond to corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive drug treatment. This review shows that intravenous infusions of infliximab, a TNF-α blocking agent is effective in inducing clinical remission, promoting mucosal healing, and reducing the need for colectomy in patients with active ulcerative colitis whose disease has not responded to conventional treatment."
