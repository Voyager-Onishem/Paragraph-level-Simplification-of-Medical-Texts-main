      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "Methadone maintenance was the first widely used opioid replacement therapy to treat heroin dependence, and it remains the best-researched treatment for this problem. Despite the widespread use of methadone in maintenance treatment for opioid dependence in many countries, it is a controversial treatment whose effectiveness has been disputed."

      "heading": "Objectives",
      "text": "To evaluate the effects of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) compared with treatments that did not involve opioid replacement therapy (i.e., detoxification, offer of drug-free rehabilitation, placebo medication, wait-list controls) for opioid dependence."

      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "Eleven studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review, all were randomised clinical trials, two were double-blind. There were a total number of 1969 participants. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study, adequate in five studies and unclear in the remaining studies. The allocation of concealment was adequate in three studies and unclear in the remaining studies. Methadone appeared statistically significantly more effective than non-pharmacological approaches in retaining patients in treatment and in the suppression of heroin use as measured by self report and urine/hair analysis (6 RCTs, RR = 0.66 95% CI 0.56-0.78), but not statistically different in criminal activity (3 RCTs, RR=0.39; 95%CI: 0.12-1.25) or mortality (4 RCTs, RR=0.48; 95%CI: 0.10-2.39)."

    {
      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Methadone is an effective maintenance therapy intervention for the treatment of heroin dependence as it retains patients in treatment and decreases heroin use better than treatments that do not utilise opioid replacement therapy. It does not show a statistically significant superior effect on criminal activity or mortality."

  "pls": "Methadone maintenance treatment can keep people who are dependent on heroin in treatment programs and reduce their use of heroin. Methadone is the most widely used replacement for heroin in medically-supported maintenance or detoxification programs. Several non-drug detoxification and rehabilitation methods are also used to try and help people withdraw from heroin. However the review found that people have withdrawn from trials when they are assigned to a drug-free program. Consequently, there are no trials comparing methadone maintenance treatment with drug-free methods other than methadone placebo trials, or comparing methadone maintenance with methadone for detoxification only. These trials show that methadone can reduce the use of heroin in dependent people, and keep them in treatment programs."
