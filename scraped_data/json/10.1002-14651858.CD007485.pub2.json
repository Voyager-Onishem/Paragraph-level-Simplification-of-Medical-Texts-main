      "text": "Maternal antenatal transfers provide better neonatal outcomes. However, there will inevitably be some infants who require acute transport to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Because of this, many institutions develop services to provide neonatal transport by specially trained health personnel. However, few studies report on relevant clinical outcomes in infants requiring transport to NICU."

Data on relevant outcomes were extracted and the effect size estimated and reported as risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. Data from cluster randomised trials were not combined for analysis."

Cluster randomised trial study designs may be best suited to provide us with answers on effectiveness and clinical outcomes."

      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "High-risk newborn infants tend to have better outcomes if born in a centre with a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Although it is advocated that women with high risk factors be transferred to centres with NICU facilities for delivery, at times it is inevitable that birth occurs at centres that are unable to treat their newborns. Therefore, the need for specially trained neonatal transport health personnel is important to ensure that these infants are stabilised and transported to hospitals with an NICU. This review was conducted to find out whether specially trained neonatal transport teams, compared with general transport teams, had better clinical outcomes."

It may be necessary to rely on evidence from cluster trials (where groups of hospitals are compared) or good quality non-randomised study designs to provide answers to this question."
