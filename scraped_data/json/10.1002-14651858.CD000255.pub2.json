      "text": "We did not find any completed randomised trials. Comparing antiplatelets with anticoagulants across 36 observational studies (1285 patients), there were no significant differences in the odds of death (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 2.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.60), or the occurrence of ischaemic stroke (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.86) (34 studies, 1262 patients). For the outcome of death or disability, there was a non-significant trend in favour of anticoagulants (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.22; P = 0.06) (26 studies, 463 patients). Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages (5/627; 0.8%) and major extracranial haemorrhages (7/425; 1.6%) occurred only in the anticoagulation group; however, for both these outcomes, the estimates were imprecise and indicated no significant difference between the two treatment modalities."

    {
      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "There were no randomised trials comparing either anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs with control, thus there is no evidence to support their routine use for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. There were also no randomised trials that directly compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet drugs and the reported non-randomised studies did not show any evidence of a significant difference between the two."

  "pls": "Carotid artery dissection means a tear in the lining in one of the main blood vessels carrying blood to the brain. Dissection can be caused by injury to the neck, but can sometimes develop for no obvious reason. Blood clots can form where the artery is torn. These blood clots can then block the artery and cause a stroke. Blood thinning drugs such as aspirin and anticoagulants might prevent clots forming and so prevent stroke in people with carotid artery dissection. We did not find any completed randomised trials testing these drugs in people with carotid artery dissection. However, there is one ongoing trial. We found only poor quality non-randomised studies that compared anticoagulants with aspirin. There was no evidence that anticoagulants were better than aspirin. Aspirin is likely to be similarly effective and safe as anticoagulants in such patients. More research is needed."
