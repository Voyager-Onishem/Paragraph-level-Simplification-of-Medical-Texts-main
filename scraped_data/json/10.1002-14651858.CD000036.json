      "text": "Larger, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the effects of betamimetics on fetal growth. Since there is potential for adverse effects due to the pharmacological characteristics of this group of drugs, data related to any potential harms should be collected in addition to beneficial effects."

  "pls": "Too little evidence to show whether betamimetic drugs for women during pregnancy benefits unborn babies who are smaller than expected.\nBetamimetic drugs such as ritodrine relax muscles and help the body break down sugar found in fruit and meat (glucose) for energy. It has been thought that betamimetic drugs taken by mouth or injection by women who are more than 27 weeks' pregnant may improve the growth of unborn babies who are smaller than expected (impaired fetal growth). The review of two trials (118 women) has found too little evidence to show whether the unborn baby's growth improves when the mother takes betamimetic drugs. More research is needed into the short and long-term effects of betamimetic drugs on women and their babies."
