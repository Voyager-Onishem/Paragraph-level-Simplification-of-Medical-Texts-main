The use of an appropriate sedative agent is important to ensure the successful completion of the neurodiagnostic procedures, particularly in children, who are usually unable to remain still throughout the procedure."

      "text": "We included 16 studies with a total of 2922 children. The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed. Blinding of the participants and personnel was not achieved in most of the included studies, and three of the 16 studies were at high risk of bias for selective reporting. Evaluation of the efficacy of the sedative agents was also underpowered, with all the comparisons performed in small studies.\nFewer children who received oral chloral hydrate had sedation failure compared with oral promethazine (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.82; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). More children who received oral chloral hydrate had sedation failure after one dose compared to intravenous pentobarbital (RR 4.33, 95% CI 1.35 to 13.89; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), but there was no clear difference after two doses (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.46; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Children with oral chloral hydrate had more sedation failure compared with rectal sodium thiopental (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.96; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence) and music therapy (RR 17.00, 95% CI 2.37 to 122.14; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Sedation failure rates were similar between groups for comparisons with oral dexmedetomidine, oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride, oral midazolam and oral clonidine.\nChildren who received oral chloral hydrate had a shorter time to adequate sedation compared with those who received oral dexmedetomidine (MD −3.86, 95% CI −5.12 to −2.6; 1 study), oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride (MD −7.5, 95% CI −7.85 to −7.15; 1 study), oral promethazine (MD −12.11, 95% CI −18.48 to −5.74; 1 study) (moderate-certainty evidence for three aforementioned outcomes), rectal midazolam (MD −95.70, 95% CI −114.51 to −76.89; 1 study), and oral clonidine (MD −37.48, 95% CI −55.97 to −18.99; 1 study) (low-certainty evidence for two aforementioned outcomes). However, children with oral chloral hydrate took longer to achieve adequate sedation when compared with intravenous pentobarbital (MD 19, 95% CI 16.61 to 21.39; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), intranasal midazolam (MD 12.83, 95% CI 7.22 to 18.44; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), and intranasal dexmedetomidine (MD 2.80, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.83; 1 study, moderate-certainty evidence).\nChildren who received oral chloral hydrate appeared significantly less likely to complete neurodiagnostic procedure with child awakening when compared with rectal sodium thiopental (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence).\nChloral hydrate was associated with a higher risk of the following adverse events: desaturation versus rectal sodium thiopental (RR 5.00, 95% 0.24 to 102.30; 1 study), unsteadiness versus intranasal dexmedetomidine (MD 10.21, 95% CI 0.58 to 178.52; 1 study), vomiting versus intranasal dexmedetomidine (MD 10.59, 95% CI 0.61 to 185.45; 1 study) (low-certainty evidence for aforementioned three outcomes), and crying during administration of sedation versus intranasal dexmedetomidine (MD 1.39, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.80; 1 study, moderate-certainty evidence). Chloral hydrate was associated with a lower risk of the following: diarrhoea compared with rectal sodium thiopental (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.72; 1 study), lower mean diastolic blood pressure compared with sodium thiopental (MD 7.40, 95% CI 5.11 to 9.69; 1 study), drowsiness compared with oral clonidine (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.64; 1 study), vertigo compared with oral clonidine (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.79; 1 study) (moderate-certainty evidence for aforementioned four outcomes), and bradycardia compared with intranasal dexmedetomidine (MD 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.59; 1 study; high-certainty evidence). No other adverse events were significantly associated with chloral hydrate, although there was an increased risk of combined adverse events overall (RR 7.66, 95% CI 1.78 to 32.91; 1 study; low-certainty evidence)."

      "text": "The certainty of evidence for the comparisons of oral chloral hydrate against several other methods of sedation was variable. Oral chloral hydrate appears to have a lower sedation failure rate when compared with oral promethazine. Sedation failure was similar between groups for other comparisons such as oral dexmedetomidine, oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride, and oral midazolam. Oral chloral hydrate had a higher sedation failure rate when compared with intravenous pentobarbital, rectal sodium thiopental, and music therapy. Chloral hydrate appeared to be associated with higher rates of adverse events than intranasal dexmedetomidine. However, the evidence for the outcomes for oral chloral hydrate versus intravenous pentobarbital, rectal sodium thiopental, intranasal dexmedetomidine, and music therapy was mostly of low certainty, therefore the findings should be interpreted with caution.\nFurther research should determine the effects of oral chloral hydrate on major clinical outcomes such as successful completion of procedures, requirements for an additional sedative agent, and degree of sedation measured using validated scales, which were rarely assessed in the studies included in this review. The safety profile of chloral hydrate should be studied further, especially for major adverse effects such as oxygen desaturation."

Sedative agents are required for children, who are usually unable to remain still for this period of time."

      "text": "We included 16 studies involving a total of 2922 children (age up to 18 years old) in the review. All of the included studies were performed in hospitals that provided neurodiagnostic services. Most studies assessed the following three main outcomes: proportion of children who were unsuccessfully sedated for the neurodiagnostic procedure; length of time taken for adequate sedation; and side effects associated with the sedative agent. The quality of the evidence was mixed, ranging from very low to high. The main reason for lowering the quality of the evidence was that those closely involved in the trials, such as the doctors giving the sedation or the parents of the child, were not masked to the sedative agent used in the child, which could have affected their recording or interpretation of the results."

Our review suggests that oral chloral hydrate is just as effective a sedative agent with similar sedation failure rate when compared with oral dexmedetomidine, oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride, oral midazolam, and oral clonidine; and probably a more effective sedative agent with a lower sedation failure rate when compared with oral promethazine. Whilst most of the included studies showed that chloral hydrate was safe with no increase in side effects when compared to other sedative agents, one study reported an increased risk of side effects with oral chloral hydrate when compared with intranasal dexmedetomidine."

      "text": "Apart from intravenous pentobarbital, rectal sodium thiopental, and music therapy, oral chloral hydrate is either just as effective or more effective as a sedating agent when compared to other sedating agents for children undergoing non-invasive neurodiagnostic procedures. Given the poor quality of the evidence, we could draw no clear conclusions on the effectiveness or safety of any of the paediatric sedative agents studied in the review. Further study is needed to look at the side effects of oral chloral hydrate when compared to other sedatives."
