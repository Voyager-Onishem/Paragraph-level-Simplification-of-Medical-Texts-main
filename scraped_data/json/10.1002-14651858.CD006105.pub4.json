      "text": "The use of insulin-sensitising agents, such as metformin, in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who are undergoing ovulation induction or in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles has been widely studied. Metformin reduces hyperinsulinaemia and suppresses the excessive ovarian production of androgens. It is suggested that as a consequence metformin could improve assisted reproductive techniques (ART) outcomes, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), pregnancy, and live birth rates."

      "text": "This updated review includes 13 RCTs involving a total of 1132 women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatments. We stratified the analysis by type of ovarian stimulation protocol used (long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-agonist) or short gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-antagonist)) to determine whether the type of stimulation used influenced the outcomes. We did not perform meta-analysis on the overall (both ovarian stimulation protocols combined) data for the outcomes of live birth and clinical pregnancy rates per woman because of substantial heterogeneity.\nIn the long protocol GnRH-agonist subgroup, the pooled evidence showed that we are uncertain of the effect of metformin on live birth rate per woman when compared with placebo/no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.79; 6 RCTs; 651 women; I2 = 47%; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if the chance for live birth following placebo/no treatment is 28%, the chance following metformin would be between 27% and 51%. Only one study used short protocol GnRH-antagonist and reported live birth rate. Metformin may reduce live birth rate compared with placebo/no treatment (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.79; 1 RCT; 153 women; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if the chance for live birth following placebo/no treatment is 43%, the chance following metformin would be between 13% and 34% (short GnRH-antagonist protocol). We found that metformin may reduce the incidence of OHSS (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.72; 11 RCTs; 1091 women; I2 = 38%; low-quality evidence). This suggests that for a woman with a 20% risk of OHSS without metformin, the corresponding risk using metformin would be between 6% and 14%. Using long protocol GnRH-agonist stimulation, metformin may increase clinical pregnancy rate per woman compared with placebo/no treatment (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.63; 10 RCTs; 915 women; I2 = 13%; low-quality evidence). Using short protocol GnRH-antagonist, we are uncertain of the effect of metformin on clinical pregnancy rate per woman compared with placebo/no treatment (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 9.14; 2 RCTs; 177 women; I2 = 87%; very low-quality evidence).\nWe are uncertain of the effect of metformin on miscarriage rate per woman when compared with placebo/no treatment (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.32; 8 RCTs; 821 women; I2 = 0%; low-quality evidence). Metformin may result in an increase in side effects compared with placebo/no treatment (RR 3.35, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.79; 8 RCTs; 748 women; I2 = 0%; low-quality evidence).\nThe overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to low. The main limitations were inconsistency, risk of bias, and imprecision."

In a long GnRH-agonist protocol, we are uncertain whether metformin improves live birth rates, but metformin may increase the clinical pregnancy rate. In a short GnRH-antagonist protocol, metformin may reduce live birth rates, although we are uncertain about the effect of metformin on clinical pregnancy rate. Metformin may reduce the incidence of OHSS but may result in a higher incidence of side effects. We are uncertain of the effect of metformin on miscarriage rate per woman."

      "text": "In women with PCOS there is a chronic failure or absence of ovulation (anovulation) and excessive production of male hormones (hyperandrogenism). The main symptoms of the disorder are irregular periods, infertility, hirsutism (excessive facial and body hair growth), and acne. PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in women, affecting 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age. IVF could be an effective treatment option for infertility in women with PCOS who do not respond to ovulation induction treatments. In the first part of IVF treatment, ovarian stimulation using gonadotrophins is necessary to develop more mature oocytes in order to produce more good-quality embryos to be transferred into the uterus. This overstimulation increases the risk of developing a serious complication known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Strategies used during IVF treatments to decrease the risk of OHSS include: low-dose gonadotrophin ovarian stimulation, metformin co-treatment, use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-antagonist protocol instead of GnRH-agonist, and use of GnRH-agonist trigger to final oocyte maturation rather than the usual human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)-trigger."

We are uncertain of the effect of metformin using long protocol GnRH-agonist on live birth rates compared with placebo or no treatment, but metformin may increase clinical pregnancy rate with this type of ovarian stimulation protocol. Metformin may reduce the incidence of OHSS. We estimated that for a woman with a 28% chance of achieving a live birth (long protocol GnRH-agonist) following placebo or no treatment, the chance following metformin would be between 27% and 51%. For a woman with a 28% chance of achieving a clinical pregnancy in long protocol GnRH-agonist without metformin, the chance using metformin would be between 30% and 45%.\nFor the short protocol GnRH-antagonist, metformin may reduce live birth rate, and we are uncertain of its effect on clinical pregnancy and OHSS rates compared with placebo/no treatment.\nOverall, metformin may reduce the incidence of OHSS when compared with placebo/no treatment. For a woman with a 20% risk of OHSS without metformin, the corresponding risk using metformin would be between 6% and 14%. Side effects (mostly gastrointestinal) may be more common with metformin. We are uncertain of the effect of metformin on miscarriage rates when compared with placebo/no treatment."
