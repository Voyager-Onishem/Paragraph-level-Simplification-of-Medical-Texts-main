      "text": "We included 25 studies involving 4121 participants (2511 children and 1517 adults; 93 mixed population). Four studies were of high quality with no risk of bias, 14 of medium quality and seven of low quality, indicating a moderate risk of bias for the total analysis. Nine studies were performed in low-income countries and 16 in high-income countries.\nThere was insufficient evidence that corticosteroids caused a reduction in mortality overall (17.8% versus 19.9%; risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.01; P = 0.07), or for adults (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.05; P = 0.09). However they caused lower rates of severe hearing loss (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88), any hearing loss (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87) and neurological sequelae (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.00).\nSubgroup analyses for causative organisms showed that corticosteroids reduced mortality in Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae ) meningitis (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98), but not in Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae ) orNeisseria meningitidis (N meningitidis ) meningitis. Corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss in children with H influenzae meningitis (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.59) but not in children with meningitis due to non-Haemophilus species.\nIn high-income countries, corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.73), any hearing loss (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.73) and short-term neurological sequelae (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.85). There was no beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries.\nSubgroup analysis for study quality showed no effect of corticosteroids on severe hearing loss in high-quality studies.\nCorticosteroid treatment was associated with an increase in recurrent fever (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.47), but not with other adverse events."

      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "Acute bacterial meningitis is an infection of the meninges (the system of membranes that envelops the brain and spinal cord), which often causes hearing loss. Bacterial meningitis is fatal in 5% to 40% of children and 20% to 50% of adults despite treatment with adequate antibiotics. It is caused by bacteria that usually spread from an ear or respiratory infection and is treated with antibiotics.\nCorticosteroids are drugs that can reduce the inflammation caused by infection. This inflammation has been shown to aggravate damage to the nervous system in experimental meningitis studies in animals. Research on the use of corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics has had conflicting results.\nWe wanted to discover whether use of corticosteroids was better of worse than placebo."

We identified 25 trials, including 4121 participants with acute bacterial meningitis of which seven were performed in adults (over 16 years old), two included both children and adults and the other were performed in children. In 22 studies the corticosteroid used was dexamethasone, in three others hydrocortisone or prednisone were used. Nine studies were performed in low-income countries and 16 in high-income countries."

Patients treated with corticosteroids had significantly lower rates of severe hearing loss (6.0% versus 9.3%), any hearing loss (13.8% versus 19.0%) and neurological sequelae (17.9% versus 21.6%).\nAn analysis for different bacteria causing meningitis showed that patients with meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae ) treated with corticosteroids had a lower death rate (29.9% versus 36.0%), while no effect on mortality was seen in patients with Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae ) and Neisseria meningitidis (N meningitidis) meningitis.\nIn high-income countries, corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss, any hearing loss and short-term neurological sequelae. There was no beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries.\nCorticosteroids decreased the rate of hearing loss in children with meningitis due to H influenzae (4% versus 12%), but not in children with meningitis due to other bacteria.\nDexamethasone increased the rate of recurrent fever (28% versus 22%) but was not associated with other adverse events."
