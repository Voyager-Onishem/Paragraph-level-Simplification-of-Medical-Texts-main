Vaginal microbicides, substances inserted into the vagina to prevent women acquiring HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from men, could be useful in this regard. One potential vaginal microbicide is the widely used spermicide, nonoxynol-9 (N-9)."

Overall, the risk of HIV infection was not statistically significantly different among women receiving N-9 (relative risk [RR] 1.12, 95% CI 0.88-1.42; p=0.4). The risk of genital lesions was statistically significantly greater among women receiving N-9 (RR 1.18, 95%CI 1.02-1.36; p=0.02)."
