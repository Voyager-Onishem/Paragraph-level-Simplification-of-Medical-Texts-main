      "text": "Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality globally constituting 13% of overall neonatal mortality. Despite the high burden of neonatal sepsis, high-quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. Due to the diagnostic challenges of sepsis and the relative immunosuppression of the newborn, many neonates receive antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Antibiotics have become the most used therapeutics in neonatal intensive care units, and observational studies in high-income countries suggest that 83% to 94% of newborns treated with antibiotics for suspected sepsis have negative blood cultures. The last Cochrane Review was updated in 2005. There is a need for an updated systematic review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late-onset neonatal sepsis."

Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and our secondary outcomes were: serious adverse events, respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, necrotising enterocolitis, and ototoxicity. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow-up."

All trials were at high risk of bias, and had very low-certainty evidence.\nThe five included trials assessed five different comparisons of antibiotics.\nWe did not conduct a meta-analysis due to lack of relevant data.\nOf the five included trials one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam.\nNone of the five comparisons found any evidence of a difference when assessing all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, or necrotising enterocolitis; however, none of the trials were near an information size that could contribute significantly to the evidence of the comparative benefits and risks of any particular antibiotic regimen.\nNone of the trials assessed respiratory support or ototoxicity.\nThe benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the lack of well-powered trials and the high risk of systematic errors."

Despite this high burden of sepsis in newborns, high-quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2005. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well-conducted review. Therefore, there is a need for such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late-onset neonatal sepsis."

Current evidence cannot confirm or reject, one antibiotic regimen being superior to another due to scarce data."

The five trials were at high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise."
