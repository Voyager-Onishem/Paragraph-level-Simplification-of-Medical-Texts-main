      "heading": "Main results",
      "text": "We included seven trials (246 participants). Force platform feedback did not improve clinical measures of balance when moving or walking (Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go). Significant improvements in laboratory force platform indicators of stance symmetry were found for regimens using visual feedback (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.31 to -0.04, p = 0.04) and the concurrent visual and auditory feedback (weighted mean difference (WMD) -4.02, 95% CI -5.99 to -2.04, p = 0.00007). There were no significant effects on laboratory postural sway indicators, clinical outcomes or measures of function at follow-up assessment."

  "pls": "Feedback from a force platform improves standing balance but the impact on independence is unclear. People who have had a stroke often experience problems with standing balance. Impaired standing balance is often treated with balance exercises suggested by a physiotherapist. Exercises are sometimes given with feedback from a force platform to indicate the person's standing position. The results of seven clinical trials indicated that providing feedback from a force platform resulted in patients standing more evenly but did not improve balance during active functional activities, nor did it improve overall independence."
