Failure to recruit adequate follicles is called 'poor response'. Various treatment protocols have been proposed that are targeted at this cohort of women, aiming to increase their ovarian response."

The citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, abstracts of scientific meetings and included studies were also searched. The authors were contacted to clarify data that were unclear from the trial reports."

Validity was assessed in terms of method of randomisation, completeness of treatment cycle and co-intervention. Where possible, data were pooled for analysis."

      "text": "The new search identified fifteen trials. Three trials were eligible for inclusion. Ten trials involving eight different comparison groups have been included. Only one trial reported live birth rates.\nThe number of oocytes retrieved were significantly less in the conventional GnRHa long protocol compared to stop protocol and GnRH antagonist protocol.\nTotal dose of gonadotrophins used was significantly higher in the GnRHa long protocol group compared to the Stop protocol and GnRH antagonist groups.\nCancellation rates were significantly higher in the GnRHa flare up group compared to the GnRHa long protocol group.\nNone of the studies reported a difference in the miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy rates."

More robust data from good quality RCTs with relevant outcomes are needed."

  "pls": "The successful end-point of IVF treatment is for a woman to give birth to a live infant. This outcome is based on various factors including adequate number of retrieved eggs, which are obtained using various treatment protocols. Failure to recruit adequate follicles, from which the eggs are retrieved, is called a 'poor response'. Various treatment protocols targeted at these women have been proposed, aiming to increase their ovarian response. This review of ten randomised controlled trials suggests there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of any one particular intervention in the management of women who are poor responders. More research is needed with good quality trials looking at relevant outcomes such as live birth rates rather than treatment-associated outcomes such as positive pregnancy rates or number of eggs. Research is also recommended in adverse outcomes and costs of these treatments."
