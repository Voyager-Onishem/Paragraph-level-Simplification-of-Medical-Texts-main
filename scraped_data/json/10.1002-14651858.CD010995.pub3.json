We searched the Stroke Trials Registry (last search 7 December 2017, as the site is currently inactive). We also screened references lists of relevant trials, contacted trialists, and undertook forward tracking of relevant references."

All trials used advanced imaging for selecting patients to treat.\nFor intravenous thrombolytic treatment, good functional outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2) at 90 days follow-up was observed in 66% of participants randomised to thrombolytic treatment and 58% of participants randomised to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.26; P = 0.03; 763 participants, 5 RCTs; high-certainty evidence). Seven per cent of participants randomised to intravenous thrombolytic treatment and 10% of participants randomised to control had died at 90 days follow-up (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07; P = 0.09; 763 participants, 5 RCTs; high-certainty evidence). Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage occurred in 3% of participants randomised to intravenous thrombolytic treatment and 1% of participants randomised to control (RR 3.47, 95% CI 0.98 to 12.26; P = 0.05; 754 participants, 4 RCTs; high-certainty evidence).\nFor endovascular thrombectomy of large vessel occlusion, good functional outcome at 90 days follow-up was observed in 46% of participants randomised to endovascular thrombectomy and 9% of participants randomised to control (RR 5.12, 95% CI 2.57 to 10.17; P < 0.001; 205 participants, 2 RCTs; high-certainty evidence). Twenty-two per cent of participants randomised to endovascular thrombectomy and 33% of participants randomised to control had died at 90 days follow-up (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07; P = 0.10; 205 participants, 2 RCTs; high-certainty evidence)."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "In selected patients with acute ischaemic wake-up stroke, both intravenous thrombolytic treatment and endovascular thrombectomy of large vessel occlusion improved functional outcome without increasing the risk of death. However, a possible increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage associated with thrombolytic treatment cannot be ruled out. The criteria used for selecting patients to treatment differed between the trials. All studies were relatively small, and six of the seven studies were terminated early. More studies are warranted in order to determine the optimal criteria for selecting patients for treatment."

      "text": "Most strokes are caused by a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain by a blood clot (ischaemic stroke). This is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Treatments to reopen blood vessels such as clot-dissolving drugs (thrombolysis) or mechanical devices to remove blood clots (thrombectomy) may improve recovery after ischaemic stroke if blood flow is rapidly restored.\nAbout one in five strokes occur during sleep (wake-up stroke). People with wake-up stroke have traditionally been considered to be ineligible for recanalisation therapies because the time of stroke onset is unknown. However, recent studies of selected patients suggest benefit from recanalisation therapies."

However, we cannot rule out the possibility that treatment increases the risk of bleeding in the brain. The optimal selection criteria with regard to imaging criteria or time window, or both, for choosing patients to treat is still unclear; these criteria differed between the trials. More trials to investigate this further are therefore warranted."
