We checked the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials."

      "text": "We identified one randomized controlled study recruiting 97 low birthweight infants that met the inclusion criteria. The study was conducted in the UK in 1987 and 1988. Randomized infants received ETT suctioning every six or 12 hours during the first three days of life. The quality of reporting was limited and we rated the trial at high risk of bias. Furthermore, the trial lacked adequate power. There were no statistically significant differences in any of reported outcomes: bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined as oxygen at more than 30 days; risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 1.20); incidence of pneumothorax (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.05); intraventricular hemorrhage (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.85); neonatal death (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.58 to 3.37); and time on ventilation (median time 39 hours in the 12-hourly group and 28 hours in the six-hourly group; RD not applicable for this outcome as mean and standard deviation were not reported). Tests for heterogeneity were not applicable as only one study was included."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "There was insufficient evidence to identify the ideal frequency of ETT suctioning in ventilated neonates. Future research should focus on the effects in the very preterm newborns, that is, the most vulnerable population as concerns the risk of both lung and brain damage. Assessment should include the cases of prolonged ventilation, when more abundant, dense secretions are common. Clinical trials might include comparisons between 'as-scheduled' versus 'as-needed' endotracheal suctioning, that is, based on specific indications, as well frequent versus less frequent suctioning schedules."

      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "Newborns might need help with breathing as their lungs are still maturing. An airway catheter (tube) is inserted into the mouth or nose in order to maintain an open airway (patency) in newborns who are unable to breathe on their own. This procedure is called endotracheal intubation. Endotracheal tube suction is necessary to clear secretions and to maintain airway patency, therefore ensuring that the baby receives enough oxygen. The goal of endotracheal intubation suction should be remove as much of the secretions as possible with minimal side effects associated with the procedure. However, suctioning causes stress, pain, and inflammation (swelling) of the windpipe in newborns. The optimal frequency of suctioning has not been defined. Suctioning inside the airway tube might be performed 'as scheduled' by the specialist or only 'as needed'. Moreover, the 'as scheduled' approach might be more or less frequent. We explored the current evidence, up to October 2015, supporting one schedule or another."
