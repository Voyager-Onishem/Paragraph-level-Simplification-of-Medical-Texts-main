      "text": "Propentofylline is a novel therapeutic agent for dementia that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and acts by blocking the uptake of adenosine and inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase. In vitro and in vivo its mechanism of action appears to be twofold; it inhibits the production of free radicals and reduces the activation of microglial cells. It therefore interacts with the inflammatory processes that are thought to contribute to dementia, and given its mechanism of action is a possible disease modifying agent rather than a purely symptomatic treatment."

The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources.\nAventis, the manufacturing pharmaceutical company, was asked for data from unpublished studies but declined to enter into correspondence."

There were a statistically significant treatment effects in favour of placebo at 12 months, for the number of dropouts [OR=1.43, 95%CI 1.04 to 1.90, P=0.03]."

      "text": "There is limited evidence that propentofylline might benefit cognition, global function and activities of daily living of people with Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia. The meta-analyses reported here are far from satisfactory as a summary of the efficacy of propentofylline, considering the unpublished information on another 1200 patients in randomized trials that exists. Unfortunately Aventis has been unwilling to correspond with the authors, significantly limiting the scope of this review."

  "pls": "Propentofylline is a novel putatively neuroprotective agent that acts by inhibiting the uptake of adenosine and blocking the enzyme phosphodiesterase. Although a number of randomized controlled trials have been undertaken, data were available from only a very limited number of these studies. These limited data suggest that propentofylline may have a beneficial effect on measures of cognitive and global function of people with Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. The unavailability of data, due to failure of Aventis, the manufacturing pharmaceutical company, to release information about unpublished studies prevented a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis."
