Patients given a high-carbohydrate feeding formula had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.12 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.39) for developing pneumonia compared to patients given a high-fat enteral formula (P value = 0.0004). Patients given a high-carbohydrate formula had an OR of 0.36 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.15) for risk of death compared to patients given a high-fat enteral formula; this difference did not reach statistical significance (P value = 0.08). Risk of bias in these studies was assessed as high and moderate."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "The available evidence suggests that use of high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat enteral feeds in patients with at least 10% TBSA burns might reduce the incidence of pneumonia compared with use of a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet. The available evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect of either enteral feeding regimen on mortality. Note that the available evidence is limited to two small studies judged to be of moderate risk of bias. Further research is needed in this area before strong conclusions can be drawn."

  "pls": "Patients with severe burn injuries have increased metabolic needs. For this and other reasons, they are often fed a formula through a tube inserted directly into the stomach or small intestine, a process known as enteral feeding. Aggressive enteral feeding of burn patients with a high-protein diet is a core component of the treatment of severe burn injuries. However, the optimal proportions of fats and carbohydrates in feeding formulas are unknown. This review of 93 burn patients in two randomized controlled trials found that high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat enteral feeds reduced incidence of pneumonia compared with low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat enteral feeds in patients hospitalized with severe burn injuries. No conclusions could be made about the effect of different enteral feeding regimens on death.\nThe strength of this review's findings were limited by the number, size, and quality of eligible trials. Further research is needed before strong scientific conclusions and sound clinical recommendations can be made."
