      "heading": "What was studied in the review?",
      "text": "Frequently offering extended hours, shorter wait times, and lower prices, retail clinics have become popular alternatives to traditional physician offices and emergency rooms for people with low acuity illnesses. Despite their growing popularity, walk-in clinics have been controversial. Surveys have shown that some doctors in the UK, Canada, and Australia are concerned that walk-in clinics may provide lower quality care than physician offices. In the US, prominent physician groups have voiced similar concerns. A systematic review of the research literature on the quality and patient satisfaction of walk-in clinics as compared to physician offices and emergency rooms would give patients, practitioners, and health policymakers an objective understanding of this increasingly important but controversial healthcare resource."
