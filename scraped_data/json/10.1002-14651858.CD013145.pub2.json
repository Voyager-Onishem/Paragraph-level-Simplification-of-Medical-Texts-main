Multi-nutrient fortifiers used to increase the nutritional content of the breast milk are commonly derived from bovine milk. Human milk-derived multi-nutrient fortifier is now available, but it is not clear if it improves outcomes in preterm infants fed with breast milk."

We reported dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs), number needed to treat (NNT) where applicable, and continuous data using mean differences (MDs). We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach."

Human milk-based fortifier did not decrease the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in exclusively breast milk-fed preterm infants (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.2 to 4.54; 1 study, 125 infants, low certainty of evidence). Human milk-derived fortifiers did not improve growth, decrease feeding intolerance, late-onset sepsis, or death."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "There is insufficient evidence evaluating human milk-derived fortifier with bovine milk-derived fortifier in exclusively breast milk-fed preterm infants. Low-certainty evidence from one study suggests that in exclusively breast milk-fed preterm infants human milk-derived fortifiers in comparison with bovine milk-derived fortifier may not change the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, mortality, feeding intolerance, infection, or improve growth. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate short-term and long-term outcomes."

This evidence is insufficient to conclude whether nutrient made from human milk (multi-nutrient fortifier) when provided to preterm infants fed only with breast milk is beneficial or not. More studies are needed to address this important question."
