      "text": "Five trials with 196 people were included. One three-arm trial (47 participants) compared arthrographic distension using steroid and air to distension using air alone and to steroid injection alone. One trial (46 participants) compared arthrographic distension using steroid and saline to placebo. Two trials (45 and 22 participants) compared arthrographic distension using steroid to steroid injection alone. One trial (36 participants) compared arthrographic distension using steroid and saline plus physical therapy to physical therapy alone. Trials included similar study participants, but quality and reporting of data were variable. Only one trial was at low risk of bias. No meta-analysis was performed.\nThe trial with low risk of bias demonstrated that distension with saline and steroid was better than placebo for pain (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 2), function (NNTB = 3) and range of movement at three weeks. This benefit was maintained at six and 12 weeks only for one of two scores measuring function (NNT = 3). A second trial with high risk of bias also reported that distension combined with physical therapy improved range of movement and median percent improvement in pain (but not pain score) at eight weeks compared to physical therapy alone. Three further trials, all at high risk of bias, reported conflicting, variable effects of arthrographic distension with steroid compared to distension alone, and arthrographic distension with steroid compared to intra-articular steroid injection. The trials reported a small number of minor adverse effects, mainly pain during and after the procedure."

      "text": "What is adhesive capsulitis and what is arthrographic distension?\nAnother name for adhesive capsulitis is \"frozen shoulder\" or \"painful stiff shoulder\". In fact, it is so painful and stiff, it becomes difficult to move your shoulder in a normal way. Sometimes the loss of movement to your shoulder makes it feel like it is completely frozen. It is thought to be caused by scar-like tissue (adhesions) forming in the shoulder joint. Arthrographic distension is a procedure where fluid is injected into the shoulder joint to break up the adhesions that might be restricting the shoulder's movement and causing disability. Depending on the treatment, the fluid might contain a saline solution or steroids."

This improvement could possibly be as low as 6 or as many as 28 points on a scale of 0-100.\nAt six weeks after treatment, people's disability was improved by 46 points on a scale of 0-500. This improvement could possibly be as little as 20 points or as many as 80 points on a scale of 0-500.\nAt 12 weeks after treatment, people's disability was improved by 54 points on a scale of 0-500. This improvement could be as little as 15 points or as many as 95 points on a scale of 0-500.\nThe numbers given are our best estimate. When possible, we have also presented a range because there is a 95 percent chance that the true effect of the treatment lies somewhere between that range."
