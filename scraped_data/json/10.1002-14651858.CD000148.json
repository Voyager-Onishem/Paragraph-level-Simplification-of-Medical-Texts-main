      "text": "Four studies, involving 165 women, were included. The trials were small or had methodological limitations, or both. Carnite was associated with shorter pregnancy duration after enrolment (mean difference -2.12, 95% confidence interval -3.58 to -0.66 weeks). Intraamniotic administration of nutrients was related to higher birthweight (2575 g, standard deviation (SD) 780) as compared to intravenous administration (2080 g SD 457). No other differences were found."

  "pls": "Too little evidence to show whether extra carnitine, solcoseryl, glucose or galactose for pregnant women benefits babies in the womb who are smaller than expected.\nBabies growing more slowly than expected in the womb (impaired fetal growth) may be receiving too few nutrients from their mothers. Some nutrients thought to improve an unborn baby's growth include carnitine (amino acid which releases energy from fat), solcoseryl (protein-free calf blood extract), glucose and galactose (fruit, meat and milk sugars). The review of four trials, involving 165 women, found that there is too little evidence to show whether the baby's growth improves when a pregnant woman supplements her intake of these nutrients by mouth or injection. More research is needed into the effects of pregnant women supplementing their diets with these nutrients."
