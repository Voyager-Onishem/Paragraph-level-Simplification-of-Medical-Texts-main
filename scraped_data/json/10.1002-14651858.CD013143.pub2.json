      "text": "We included one RCT with 184 participants comparing Aquablation to TURP. The mean age and International Prostate Symptom Score were 65.9 years and 22.6, respectively. The mean prostate volume was 53.2 mL. We only found short-term data for all outcomes based on a single randomised trial.\nPrimary outcomes\nUp to 12 months, Aquablation likely results in a similar improvement in urologic symptom scores to TURP (mean difference (MD) −0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.51 to 2.39; participants = 174; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the evidence certainty by one level due to study limitations. Aquablation may also result in similar quality of life when compared to TURP (MD 0.27, 95% CI −0.24 to 0.78; participants = 174, low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the evidence certainty by two levels due to study limitations and imprecision. Aquablation may result in little to no difference in major adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.26; participants = 181, very low-certainty evidence) but we are very uncertain of this finding. This would correspond to 15 fewer major adverse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 64 fewer to 116 more). We downgraded the evidence certainty by one level for study limitations and two levels for imprecision.\nSecondary outcomes\nUp to 12 months, Aquablation may result in little to no difference in retreatments (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.18 to 15.83; participants = 181, very low-certainty evidence) but we are very uncertain of this finding. This would correspond to 10 more retreatments per 1000 participants (95% CI 13 fewer to 228 more). We downgraded the evidence certainty by one level due to study limitations and two levels for imprecision.\nAquablation may result in little to no difference in erectile function as measured by International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire Erectile Function domain compared to TURP (MD 2.31, 95% CI −0.63 to 5.25; participants = 64, very low-certainty evidence), and may cause slightly less ejaculatory dysfunction than TURP, as measured by Male Sexual Health Questionnaire for Ejaculatory Dysfunction (MD 2.57, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.53; participants = 121, very low-certainty evidence). However, we are very uncertain of both findings. We downgraded the evidence certainty by two levels due to study limitations and one level for imprecision for both outcomes.\nWe did not find other prospective, comparative studies comparing Aquablation to TURP or other procedures such as laser ablation, enucleation, or other minimally invasive therapies."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "Based on short-term (up to 12 months) follow-up, the effect of Aquablation on urological symptoms is probably similar to that of TURP (moderate-certainty evidence). The effect on quality of life may also be similar (low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether patients undergoing Aquablation are at higher or lower risk for major adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether Aquablation may result in little to no difference in erectile function but offer a small improvement in preservation of ejaculatory function (both very low-certainty evidence). These conclusions are based on a single study of men with a prostate volume up to 80 mL in size. Longer-term data and comparisons with other modalities appear critical to a more thorough assessment of the role of Aquablation for the treatment of LUTS in men with BPH."

      "heading": "Background",
      "text": "An enlarged prostate may cause bothersome urinary tract symptoms, such as having to urinate often during the day or night, having a weak stream, and the feeling of not completely emptying the bladder. When lifestyle changes (like drinking less liquids) or medications do not help, men may choose to have surgery, such as a transurethral resection of the prostate. However, this procedure may cause unwanted effects, such as erection and ejaculation problems, or require retreatment. This review looks at the results of Aquablation, which is a newer treatment that uses high-pressure water to remove prostate tissue and help with urinary tract symptoms."

      "text": "We found only one study in which chance decided how men were treated. The study compared Aquablation to transurethral resection of the prostate. On average, men were about 66 years old. We did not find any other studies.\nWe found that Aquablation likely improves urinary symptoms similarly to transurethral resection of the prostate and may also lead to similar quality of life. Rates of unwanted serious effects may also be similar but we are very uncertain about this.\nMen who have Aquablation may have a similar risk of needing a repeat procedure as those having transurethral resection of the prostate but we are very uncertain of this finding.\nAquablation may make little to no difference to erectile function but may have fewer issues with ejaculation, but we are very uncertain of both findings.\nThese findings are based on a single study funded by the company that makes the device used for Aquablation. All data were limited to 12 months' follow-up or less and prostate size was less than or equal to 80 mL."
