      "text": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) measurement is a fundamental evaluation in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), as both low and high values of CO2 might have detrimental effects on neonatal morbidity and mortality. Though measurement of CO2 in the arterial blood gas is the most accurate way to assess the amount of CO2, it requires blood sampling and it does not provide a continuous monitoring of CO2."

We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials."

There are three main methods to assess CO2: in the arterial blood gas, in the air exhaled from the body, and through the skin, that is, transcutaneously. The latter is minimally invasive and allows continuous monitoring. The evidence is current to November 2015."
