  "pls": "No evidence to show whether blood flow through the placenta is improved in pregnant women who have transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy for suspected placental insufficiency.\nBabies who do not get enough nutrients and oxygen from their mothers may compensate this situation with some changes in the blood vessels which may lead to placental insufficiency. Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to detect the movement of blood between the uterus, placenta and baby during pregnancy. TENS is a therapeutic non-invasive therapy that provides electrical stimulation via electrodes placed onto the skin. For women who have suspected placental insufficiency diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound, the review has found no evidence to show whether TENS therapy improves blood flow between the uterus, placenta and the baby."
