      "text": "One study of 209 women was included. The trial was of excellent quality. Women who were randomised to the labour assessment unit spent less time in the labour ward (weighted mean difference -5.20 hours, 95% confidence interval -7.06, -3.34), were less likely to receive intrapartum oxytocics (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.80) and analgesia (odds ratio 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.78), than women who were admitted directly to the labour ward. Women in the labour assessment group reported higher levels of control during labour (weighted mean difference 16.00, 95% confidence interval 7.52 to 24.48). There is insufficient evidence to assess effects on rate of caesarean section and other important measures of maternal and neonatal outcome."

  "pls": "Pregnant women coming into hospital with signs of labour, may benefit from formal assessment by a specialised program.\nHospital labour assessment programs are specialised programs that confirm whether women coming into hospital with signs of labour, are in active labour (with the neck of the womb opening), before going to labour ward. Women with full term pregnancies in these programs spend time in the assessment unit, walk in the grounds, go home or are admitted to labour ward. The review found they have shorter labour ward stays, feel more control and use fewer drugs to progress labour or for pain relief. There is not enough evidence on other effects on the mother or baby or on unplanned out-of-hospital birth."
