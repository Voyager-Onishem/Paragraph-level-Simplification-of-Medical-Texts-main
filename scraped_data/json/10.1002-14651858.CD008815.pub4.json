POCs include injectables, intrauterine contraception, implants, and oral contraceptives. Many POCs are long-acting, cost-effective methods of preventing pregnancy. However, concern about weight gain can deter the initiation of contraceptives and cause early discontinuation among users."

      "text": "Two authors extracted the data. Non-randomized studies (NRS) need to control for confounding factors. We used adjusted measures for the primary effects in NRS or the results of matched analysis from paired samples. If the report did not provide adjusted measures for the primary analysis, we used unadjusted outcomes. For RCTs and NRS without adjusted measures, we computed the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous variables. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI."

      "text": "We found 22 eligible studies that included a total of 11,450 women. With 6 NRS added to this update, the review includes 17 NRS and 5 RCTs. By contraceptive method, the review has 16 studies of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), 4 of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraception (LNG-IUC), 5 for implants, and 2 for progestin-only pills.\nComparison groups did not differ significantly for weight change or other body composition measure in 15 studies. Five studies with moderate or low quality evidence showed differences between study arms. Two studies of a six-rod implant also indicated some differences, but the evidence was low quality.\nThree studies showed differences for DMPA users compared with women not using a hormonal method. In a retrospective study, weight gain (kg) was greater for DMPA versus copper (Cu) IUC in years one (MD 2.28, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.77), two (MD 2.71, 95% CI 2.12 to 3.30), and three (MD 3.17, 95% CI 2.51 to 3.83). A prospective study showed adolescents using DMPA had a greater increase in body fat (%) compared with a group not using a hormonal method (MD 11.00, 95% CI 2.64 to 19.36). The DMPA group also had a greater decrease in lean body mass (%) (MD -4.00, 95% CI -6.93 to -1.07). A more recent retrospective study reported greater mean increases with use of DMPA versus Cu IUC for weight (kg) at years 1 (1.3 vs 0.2), 4 (3.5 vs 1.9), and 10 (6.6 vs 4.9).\nTwo studies reported a greater mean increase in body fat mass (%) for POC users versus women not using a hormonal method. The method was LNG-IUC in two studies (reported means 2.5 versus -1.3; P = 0.029); (MD 1.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.75). One also studied a desogestrel-containing pill (MD 3.30, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.52). Both studies showed a greater decrease in lean body mass among POC users."

      "heading": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low; more than half of the studies had low quality evidence. The main reasons for downgrading were lack of randomizations (NRS) and high loss to follow-up or early discontinuation.\nThese 22 studies showed limited evidence of change in weight or body composition with use of POCs. Mean weight gain at 6 or 12 months was less than 2 kg (4.4 lb) for most studies. Those with multiyear data showed mean weight change was approximately twice as much at two to four years than at one year, but generally the study groups did not differ significantly. Appropriate counseling about typical weight gain may help reduce discontinuation of contraceptives due to perceptions of weight gain."

  "pls_type": "long",
  "pls": "Progestin-only contraceptives (POCs) can be used by women who cannot or should not take the hormone estrogen. Many POCs are long acting, cost less than some other methods, and work well to prevent pregnancy. Some people worry that weight gain is a side effect of these birth control methods. Concern about weight gain can keep women from using these methods. Further, some women may stop using birth control early, which can lead to unplanned pregnancy. We looked at studies of POCs and changes in body weight.\n\nUntil 4 August 2016, we did computer searches for studies of a POC compared with another birth control method or no contraceptive. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find other trials. The focus was on change in body weight or other body measure of lean or fat mass.\n\nWith six new studies in this update, we have 22 studies that included 11,450 women. The groups compared did not differ much for weight change or other body measures in 15 studies. Five studies with moderate or low quality results showed a difference between study groups. Three studies showed differences for users of the injectable ‘depo’ versus no hormonal method. Depo users had a greater weight gain in two studies. In the third study, adolescents had a greater increase in body fat (%) and decrease in lean body mass (%). Two studies showed a greater increase in body fat (%) for users of hormonal intrauterine contraception versus women not using a hormonal method. One also showed a similar difference with a progestin-only pill. Both studies showed a greater decrease in lean body mass with POC use.\n\nWe found little evidence of weight gain when using POCs. Mean weight gain at 6 or 12 months was less than 2 kg (4.4 lb) for most studies. The groups using other birth control methods had about the same weight gain. Good counseling about typical weight gain may help women continue using birth control."
