Thalidomide, a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) inhibitor and its analogue, lenalidomide, may have a role in the management of Crohn's disease, but it is not clear whether it is an effective maintenance therapy."

Given the teratogenic nature of thalidomide its use for maintenance therapy is difficult to justify. Well designed clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in Crohn's disease and its use is not recommended until these data are available."

  "pls": "Prevention of relapse is a key objective in the management of Crohn's disease. There is no current treatment available that completely maintains remission and is without significant side-effects. Thalidomide is sometimes used in clinical practice to attempt to maintain remission in Crohn's disease. This review found no randomised controlled trial that had investigated the role of thalidomide or a similar drug lenalidomide, for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. There is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of these agents as maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease. However, given the well known risk of severe birth defects the use of thalidomide is not recommended. Lenalidomide has a much lower risk of causing birth defects and well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness and side effects of this drug for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. The use of lenalidomide is not recommended until data from a well designed study are available to support its use."
