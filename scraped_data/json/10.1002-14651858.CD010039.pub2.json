      "text": "Only one study (120 participants), at moderate risk of bias, was included in the review. Patients were randomised to one of three interventions: either skim milk powder (SMP) enriched with glycomacropeptide (GMP) and G600, non-enriched SMP or lactose powder, over a three-month period. The frequency of acute gout attacks, measured as the number of flares per month, decreased in all three groups over the three-month study period. Low quality evidence indicated that there was no difference between the SMP/GMP/G600 group and combined control groups (SMP and lactose powder) at three months (mean difference (MD) -0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.76 to 0.34). There were no significant between-group differences in terms of withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.03), and serious adverse events resulting in hospitalisation (2/40 SMP/GMP/G600 group versus 3/80 controls; RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 7.66). Gastrointestinal adverse effects were the most commonly reported. Pain from self reported gout flares, measured on a 10-point Likert scale, improved more in the SMP/GMP/G600 group compared to controls (MD -1.03, 95% CI -1.96 to -0.10), an absolute difference of 10% (absolute risk difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.01). This is unlikely to be of clinical significance. There was no significant difference in physical function between SMP/GMP/G600 and the control groups at three-month followup (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.08). Tophus regression and serum urate normalisation were not reported in this study."

      "text": "This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of lifestyle modifications in the treatment of people with chronic gout. There was one study included in this review which looked at the benefits and safety of consuming skim milk powder (SMP) enriched with two components of dairy products (glycomacropeptide (GMP) and G600 milk fat extract) compared to standard skim milk or lactose powder in reducing the frequency of gout attacks over a three-month period."

We do not know if consuming these dairy preparations improves tophus size (tophi are gout crystal deposits commonly found in skin, on the surface of joints or in cartilage) or blood uric acid levels, as these were not reported.\nWe do not have precise information about side effects and complications. Possible side effects may include nausea or diarrhoea."

      "heading": "What is gout and what are lifestyle interventions?",
      "text": "Gout is a very common form of painful joint inflammation (arthritis) caused by urate crystals forming either within or around joints. The inflammation can lead to pain, redness and swelling of affected joints, making the area difficult to touch or move. Some of the reasons why people get gout include their genetic makeup, being overweight, ingesting certain medications (e.g. diuretics), having impaired kidney function and lifestyle habits such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and sugar-sweetened drinks.\nAlthough medications are the mainstay of gout treatment, given the recognised association between certain lifestyle risk factors and gout development, lifestyle changes such as losing weight, stopping smoking, exercising more, drinking more coffee and dairy products, and consuming less sugar-sweetened drinks, alcoholic beverages, meat and seafood are commonly recommended to people with chronic gout."
