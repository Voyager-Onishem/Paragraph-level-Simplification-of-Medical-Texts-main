There is a need to know whether the different classes of antidepressants have similar efficacy. In addition, the tolerability of treatments may be even more important, since dysthymia is a chronic condition characterised by less severe symptoms than major depression."

      "text": "Only randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were included. Trials had to compare at least two active drug treatments in the treatment of dysthymia. Exclusion criteria were: non-randomised studies, studies which included patients with mixed major depression/dysthymia and studies on depression/dysthymia secondary to other disorders (e.g. substance abuse)."

      "text": "The reviewers extracted the data independently and odds ratios, weighted mean difference and number needed to treat were estimated. The reviewers assumed that people who died or dropped out had no improvement and tested the sensitivity of the final results to this assumption."
