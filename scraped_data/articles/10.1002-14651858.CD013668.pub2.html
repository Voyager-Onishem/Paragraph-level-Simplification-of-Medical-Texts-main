The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. </p> </section> <section id="CD013668-sec-0005"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013668-sec-0005">Data collection and analysis</h3> <p>We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratio (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs. The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. </p> </section> <section id="CD013668-sec-0006"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013668-sec-0006">Main results</h3> <p>We included data from 76 trials with a total of 21,414 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (61.9%) with a mean age of 31.8 years (standard deviation [SD] 11.7 years). On the basis of data from four trials, individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy may reduce repetition of SH as compared to TAU or another comparator by the end of the intervention (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.02; N = 238; k = 4; GRADE: low certainty evidence), although there was imprecision in the effect estimate. At longer follow‐up time points (e.g., 6‐ and 12‐months) there was some evidence that individual CBT‐based psychotherapy may reduce SH repetition. Whilst there may be a slightly lower rate of SH repetition for dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) (66.0%) as compared to TAU or alternative psychotherapy (68.2%), the evidence remains uncertain as to whether DBT reduces absolute repetition of SH by the post‐intervention assessment. On the basis of data from a single trial, mentalisation‐based therapy (MBT) reduces repetition of SH and frequency of SH by the post‐intervention assessment (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; N = 134; k = 1; GRADE: high‐certainty evidence). A group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy may also reduce repetition of SH by the post‐intervention assessment based on evidence from two trials by the same author group (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; N = 83; k = 2; moderate‐certainty evidence). There is probably little to no effect for different variants of DBT on absolute repetition of SH, including DBT group‐based skills training, DBT individual skills training, or an experimental form of DBT in which participants were given significantly longer cognitive exposure to stressful events. The evidence remains uncertain as to whether provision of information and support, based on the Suicide Trends in At‐Risk Territories (START) and the SUicide‐PREvention Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal behaviors (SUPRE‐MISS) models, have any effect on repetition of SH by the post‐intervention assessment. There was no evidence of a difference for psychodynamic psychotherapy, case management, general practitioner (GP) management, remote contact interventions, and other multimodal interventions, or a variety of brief emergency department‐based interventions. </p> </section> <section id="CD013668-sec-0007"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013668-sec-0007">Authors' conclusions</h3> <p>Overall, there were significant methodological limitations across the trials included in this review. Given the moderate or very low quality of the available evidence, there is only uncertain evidence regarding a number of psychosocial interventions for adults who engage in SH. Psychosocial therapy based on CBT approaches may result in fewer individuals repeating SH at longer follow‐up time points, although no such effect was found at the post‐intervention assessment and the quality of evidence, according to the GRADE criteria, was low. Given findings in single trials, or trials by the same author group, both MBT and group‐based emotion regulation therapy should be further developed and evaluated in adults. DBT may also lead to a reduction in frequency of SH. Other interventions were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to the use of these interventions is inconclusive at present. </p> </section> </div> </section> <section class="pico-section" id="pico"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title">PICOs <i class="icon fa fa-info-circle" title="The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

A total of 76 trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There may be beneficial effects for psychological therapy based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches at longer follow‐up time points, and for mentalisation‐based therapy (MBT), and emotion‐regulation psychotherapy at the post‐intervention assessment. There may also be some evidence of effectiveness of standard dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) on frequency of SH repetition. There was no clear evidence of effect for case management, information and support, remote contact interventions (e.g. emergency cards, postcards, telephone‐based psychotherapy), provision of information and support, and other multimodal interventions. </p> <p><b>Why is this review important?</b> </p> <p>Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments are developed for people who engage in SH. There has been an increase in both the number of trials and the diversity of therapeutic approaches for SH in adults in recent years. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. </p> <p><b>Who will be interested in this review?</b> </p> <p>Hospital administrators (e.g. service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g. health insurers), clinicians working with people who engage in SH, the people themselves, and their relatives. </p> <p><b>What questions does this review aim to answer?</b> </p> <p>This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2016 which found that CBT‐based psychological therapy can result in fewer individuals repeating SH whilst DBT may lead to a reduction in frequency of repeated SH. This updated review aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for people engaging in SH with a broader range of outcomes. </p> <p><b>Which studies were included in the review?</b> </p> <p>To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for adults who had recently engaged in SH. </p> <p><b>What does the evidence from the review tell us?</b> </p> <p>Overall, there were a number of methodological limitations across the trials included in this review. We found positive effects for psychological therapy based on CBT approaches at longer follow‐up assessments, and for mentalisation‐based therapy (MBT), and emotion‐regulation psychotherapy on repetition of SH at post‐intervention. There may also be some evidence of effects for standard dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) on frequency of SH repetition. However, remote contact interventions, case management, information and support, and other multimodal interventions do not appear to have benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. </p> <p><b>What should happen next?</b> </p> <p>The promising results for CBT‐based psychotherapy at longer follow‐up time points, and for MBT, group‐based emotion regulation, and DBT warrant further investigation to understand which people benefit from these types of interventions. Greater use of head‐to‐head trials (where treatments are directly compared with each other) may also assist in identifying which component(s) from these often complex interventions may be most effective. </p> </div> </section> <section id="vls" style="display: none"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title">Visual summary<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i></h2> </div> <a href="" target="_blank"><img alt="visual summary" src=""/></a> </section> <section class="conclusions"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD013668-sec-0567" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Authors' conclusions <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="authorsConclusions" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD013668-sec-0567"></div> <h3 class="title" id="CD013668-sec-0568">Implications for practice</h3> <section id="CD013668-sec-0568"> <p>The number of trials and range of interventions identified in this version of the review represents a considerable increase compared with the previous version (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0373" title="HawtonK , WittKG , Taylor Salisbury Tl, ArensmanE , GunnellD , HazellP , et al. Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2016, Issue 5. Art. No: CD012189. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012189]">Hawton 2016</a>). In this update, we found 76 non‐overlapping trials of a wide range of psychosocial interventions for adults who engage in SH. Overall, there were significant methodological limitations across the trials included in this review. There may be some positive effects for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy for individuals in reducing repetition of SH compared with treatment‐as‐usual (TAU), particularly over the longer term. This is perhaps unsurprising as these trials were generally much briefer in terms of the number of therapy sessions delivered (e.g., often between 3 to 5 sessions, and never more than 10 sessions) as compared with traditional CBT‐based psychotherapy for depression. Services may wish, where this is feasible, to ensure availability of clinicians to deliver these types of intervention. This is in keeping with official guidance (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0232" title="CarterG , PageA , LargeM , HetrickS , MilnerAJ , BenditN , et al. Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guideline for the management of deliberate self-harm.

Self-harm: Longer-Term Management [National Clincial Practice Guideline Number 133]. London, UK: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2011.">NICE 2011</a>). </p> <p>There were also some positive effects, particularly with regards to frequency of SH repetition, for several interventions for the treatment of individuals with borderline personality disorder (in which repetitive self‐harm is often a feature), noting that the trial participants were mostly female in these trials. Arguably, where patients engage in repeated episodes of SH, reduction in the frequency of SH could be viewed as a key outcome. Variation in the method of provision of DBT does not appear to differ in effectiveness from standard DBT. The standard DBT approach is, however, lengthy (typically one year; <a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0039" title="LinehanMM , ArmstrongHE , SuarezA , AllmonD , HeardHL . Cognitive-behavioral treatment of chronically parasuicidal borderline patients. Archives of General Psychiatry1991;48:1060-4. LinehanMM , HeardHL , ArmstrongHE . Naturalistic follow-up of a behavioral treatment for chronically parasuicidal borderline patients. Archives of GeneralPsychiatry1993;50:971-4. ">Linehan 1991</a>) and necessitates considerable therapist time. We also found some positive effects for both MBT and emotion‐regulation psychotherapy delivered in a group‐based format in individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, although these findings were based on a single trial (MBT) or trials conducted by the same group (emotion‐regulation psychotherapy). We therefore recommend further evaluation of these approaches. Given the multi‐component nature of these intervention approaches for treatment of individuals with borderline personality disorder, greater use of head‐to‐head trials, which allow for dismantling of the effect size(s) between one or more component(s), should be considered, especially as this might help to identify effective components which could be delivered more briefly. </p> <p>Remote contact interventions, such as sending regular postcards to patients, have been evaluated in several trials. Whilst positive results compared to TAU with regard to repetition of SH at both short‐ and longer‐term follow‐up have been reported, the main positive result comes from a single large trial conducted in a resource‐poor setting (Iran) where mental health services are sparse (e.g. Iran has an average of 2.0 psychiatrists and 9.5 mental health‐trained nurses per 100,000 persons; <a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0360" title="WHO. Psychiatrists and nurses working in the mental health sector (per 100,000 population), 2014-2016. gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/mental_health/psychiatrists_nurses/atlas.html (accessed 19 November 2020).">WHO 2019</a>). Therefore this relatively low intensity intervention may represent a considerable improvement over the likelihood of receiving little to no aftercare. Remote contact interventions may therefore hold some promise in settings where there are very limited psychiatric services, and should remain an area for further development in such settings. </p> <p>An argument for intervention following an episode of SH is that it may improve other outcomes even if it does not reduce SH. Secondary outcomes were examined variably in many of the included trials. There was only limited evidence that experimental interventions result in better outcomes in these other domains. CBT‐based psychotherapy, DBT, MBT, and emotion‐regulation psychotherapy may lead to better outcomes in depression severity, hopelessness, and possibly also social functioning in the short term. Case management may improve treatment adherence. However, the certainty of evidence was very low to moderate. </p> <p>Indeed, few specific types of psychosocial interventions appear to perform better than TAU. However, TAU was not well described in most clinical trials we examined. TAU also varies greatly across clinical settings (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0362" title="WittK , Pache de MoraesD , Taylor SalisburyT , ArensmanE , GunnellD , HazellP , et al.

For example, in one trial in which the comparator was 'enhanced usual care' this consisted of little more than GP management (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0036" title="FurunoT , NakagawaM , HintoK , TamadaT , KawashimaY , MatsuokaY , et al.

BMC Psychiatry2020;20:311. ">Kawanishi 2014</a>). Whilst this may represent enhanced usual care in that setting, it does not compare favourably with TAU in a number of other studies of this intervention approach (e.g. <a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0013" title="ClarkeT , BakerP , WattsCJ , WilliamsK , FeldmanRA , SherrL . Self-harm in adults: a randomised controlled trial of nurse-led case management versus routine care only. Journal of Mental Health2002;11:167-76. ">Clarke 2002</a>). A positive step forward would be the operationalisation of TAU to inform both clinical practice and research. It is possible that TAU has an advantage over some of these interventions because it offers more flexibility to tailor treatment to the specific needs of patients. </p> <p>Results of this review would also suggest that, whilst case management approaches did not appear to be effective in reducing the proportion of participants who repeat SH, case management may increase engagement with subsequent treatment whilst, additionally, enabling the identification of psychosocial needs that should be addressed during treatment. A comprehensive therapeutic psychosocial assessment combined with case management may have a potential role in encouraging individuals to attend for other types of therapy and therefore might be a useful part of a clinical intervention.

However, it is acknowledged that, in contrast to trials of pharmacological interventions (which is the subject of a related review) where repetition of SH by post‐intervention may be the most appropriate choice, there is no consensus presently as to what time point(s) may be most appropriate for trials of predominately psychosocial interventions. As the aim of many of these approaches is to equip patients with new skills that may take time for them to master and use in dealing with future crises, it may be unrealistic to expect benefits to be apparent immediately post‐intervention. This may be particularly so for the many brief intervention approaches we identified in this review. Longer follow‐up assessments are therefore advisable. Given that naturalistic studies of SH patients following discharge from services would suggest that the risk of SH repetition and suicide may be greatest in the 12‐months following discharge, peaking at one‐month post‐discharge (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0262" title="GeulayovG , CaseyD , BaleL , BrandF , ClementsC , FarooqB , et al.

In particular, the inclusion of outcomes that matter to those who engage in SH is required to further inform intervention development (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0331" title="OwensC , FoxF , RedwoodS , DaviesR , FooteL , SalisburyN , et al.

It is also important that adverse effects, both short‐ and long‐term, are carefully evaluated. </p> <p>Investigation of the mechanisms through which treatments might work is also desirable to assist with the identification of clinically relevant subgroups of patients who may benefit from certain, more intensive forms of intervention. For example, whilst CBT‐based psychotherapy may have benefit in patients for whom SH is predominately driven by depressive symptomatology (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0270" title="GøtzschePC , GøtzschePK .

Treatment may vary in terms of initial management, location of treatment, continuity, intensity, and frequency of contact with therapists. There is also considerable variation among countries in the availability of services to provide such interventions. Consequently, there is no standard psychosocial treatment of SH in adults. However, in high‐income countries, treatment generally consists of a combination of assessment, support, and individual psychological therapies. In lower and middle‐income countries, aftercare more usually involves various forms of support, both face‐to‐face and via digital means. </p> </section> <section id="CD013668-sec-0012"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013668-sec-0012">How the intervention might work</h3> <p>Psychosocial interventions may address some of the underlying psychological risk factors associated with SH. The mechanisms of action of these interventions might help people improve their coping skills and tackle specific problems, manage psychiatric disorders, improve self‐esteem, increase a sense of social connectedness, and reduce impulsivity and harmful reactions to distressing situations.

This is achieved in three steps: first, people are helped to change the ways in which they interpret and evaluate distressing emotions; second, they learn strategies to help them change the way in which they think about the meanings and consequences of these emotions; finally, with the benefit of modified interpretation of emotions and events, they are helped to change their behaviour and develop positive functional behaviour (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0292" title="JonesC , HackerD , CormacI , MeadenA , IrvingCB .

In the UK, the overall median cost per episode of SH has been estimated to be £809, although costs are significantly higher for cases of combined self‐injury and self‐poisoning, compared to either self‐injury of self‐poisoning alone.

These tables provide information concerning the overall quality of the evidence from all included trials that measured the outcome. We assessed the quality of evidence across the following domains: </p> <p> <ol id="CD013668-list-0012"> <li> <p>'Risk of bias' assessment;</p> </li> <li> <p>Indirectness of evidence;</p> </li> <li> <p>Unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results;</p> </li> <li> <p>Imprecision of effect estimates;</p> </li> <li> <p>Potential publication bias.</p> </li> </ol> </p> <p>For each of these domains, we downgraded the evidence from high certainty by one level (for serious) or by two levels (for very serious). For risk of bias, we downgraded this domain by one level when we rated any of the sources of risk of bias (as described in <a href="#CD013668-sec-0049">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</a>) at high risk for any of the studies included in the pooled estimate, or by two levels when we rated multiple studies at high risk for any of these sources. For indirectness of evidence, we considered the extent to which trials included in any meta‐analysis used proxy measures to ascertain repetition of SH; we downgraded this domain by one level if one study used proxy measures, and by two levels if multiple studies used proxy measures. For unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results, we downgraded this domain by one level where the I² value indicated substantial levels of heterogeneity, or by two levels where the I² value indicated considerable levels of heterogeneity. For imprecision, we downgraded this domain by one level where the 95% CI for the pooled effect included the null value. Finally, for the potential publication bias domain, we considered any evidence of funnel plot asymmetry (if available), as well as other evidence such as suspected selective availability of data, and downgraded by one or more levels where publication bias was suspected. </p> <p>We then used these domains to rate the overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome according to the following: </p> <p> <ol id="CD013668-list-0013"> <li> <p>High certainty: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect; </p> </li> <li> <p>Moderate certainty: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change the estimate; </p> </li> <li> <p>Low certainty: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change the estimate; </p> </li> <li> <p>Very low certainty: we are very uncertain about the estimate.</p> </li> </ol> </p> <p>We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADEpro GDT software (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0266" title="GRADEpro GDT.

Whilst around half (54.5%) of the 22 trials published subsequent to this recommendation were preregistered, in some cases there was insufficient detail provided within the clinical trial register to determine how key outcome(s) were defined. This made it difficult to determine whether there had been any substantive changes to the proposed analysis plan and, if so, the reasons for any such departures. Future trials should provide sufficient detail within the clinical trial register to determine how key outcome(s) are defined and measured to aid in the determination as to whether there has been any substantive changes to the proposed analysis plan, and if so, the reasons for any such departures. </p> <p>There were also some concerns relating to bias in the measurement of the outcome. This was typically because repetition of SH was based on self‐reported information. Given that around two‐thirds of SH recorded in medical and clinical records are not reported by participants, prevalence estimates derived from self‐reported information alone may underestimate the true rate of SH (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0317" title="MitchellAJ , HussainS , LeaverJ , RajanC , JonesA , MalcolmN , et al. Is there a difference between hospital-verified and self-reported self-harm? Implications for repetition. General Hospital Psychiatry2016;43:12-6.">Mitchell 2016</a>). By supplementing data on self‐reported SH with information from clinical or medical records, future trials could compare results based on self‐reported information with those obtained from objective sources to investigate what impact, if any, this bias may have had on the estimate of treatment effectiveness. </p> <p>Additionally, participants and clinical personnel were, typically, not blind to allocation owing to likely differences in treatment intensity between the intervention and control arms (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0364" title="WittK , TownsendE , ArensmanE , GunnellD , HazellP , Taylor SalisburyT , et al.

However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some relevant outcome data may be missing from this review. Although data on repetition of SH were available for all but two of the included trials, limited data were available on secondary outcomes. Nevertheless, by using the random‐effects model in all analyses, our results possess greater generalisability than if we had used the fixed‐effect model (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0254" title="ErezA , BloomMC , WellsMT .

For example, a decision was made to group brief problem solving therapy (PST) with CBT into a single comparison we have referred to as 'CBT‐based psychotherapy'. As PST is usually a component of CBT,  we have included trials where PST was the key therapeutic modality. It is important that those making decisions about the interventions examined in this review attend to the particular therapeutic components used in each trial included in any particular comparison (as we have detailed in the <a href="./references#CD013668-sec-0584" title="">Characteristics of included studies</a> table). </p> </section> <section id="CD013668-sec-0566"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013668-sec-0566">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</h3> <p>This review is an update of the 2016 Cochrane Review on psychosocial interventions for SH in adults (<a href="./references#CD013668-bbs2-0373" title="HawtonK , WittKG , Taylor Salisbury Tl, ArensmanE , GunnellD , HazellP , et al.

The previous review included 55 trials of seven different approaches, finding that CBT‐based psychological therapy may result in fewer individuals repeating SH whilst DBT may lead to a reduction in frequency of repeated SH. This update concurs with its previous iteration. There appears to be a probable beneficial effect for CBT‐based psychotherapy on repetition of SH as compared to TAU or another comparator immediately after the end of therapy, and this effect appears to be maintained over time. There also appears to be limited positive findings for DBT in terms of reduced frequency of SH. </p> <p>We identified 18 further reviews that included a focus on psychosocial interventions for SH in adults that have been completed since the previous version of this review was published.
