The studies differed widely according to medical condition, patient population, intervention, measures of adherence, and clinical outcomes. Pooling results according to one of these characteristics still leaves highly heterogeneous groups, and we could not justify meta‐analysis. Instead, we conducted a qualitative analysis with a focus on the RCTs with the lowest risk of bias for study design and the primary clinical outcome. </p> </section> <section id="CD000011-sec-0006"> <h3 class="title" id="CD000011-sec-0006">Main results</h3> <p>The present update included 109 new RCTs published since the previous update in January 2007, bringing the total number of RCTs to 182; we found five RCTs from the previous update to be ineligible and excluded them. Studies were heterogeneous for patients, medical problems, treatment regimens, adherence interventions, and adherence and clinical outcome measurements, and most had high risk of bias. The main changes in comparison with the previous update include that we now: 1) report a lack of convincing evidence also specifically among the studies with the lowest risk of bias; 2) do not try to classify studies according to intervention type any more, due to the large heterogeneity; 3) make our database available for collaboration on sub‐analyses, in acknowledgement of the need to make collective advancement in this difficult field of research. Of all 182 RCTs, 17 had the lowest risk of bias for study design features and their primary clinical outcome, 11 from the present update and six from the previous update. The RCTs at lowest risk of bias generally involved complex interventions with multiple components, trying to overcome barriers to adherence by means of tailored ongoing support from allied health professionals such as pharmacists, who often delivered intense education, counseling (including motivational interviewing or cognitive behavioral therapy by professionals) or daily treatment support (or both), and sometimes additional support from family or peers. Only five of these RCTs reported improvements in both adherence and clinical outcomes, and no common intervention characteristics were apparent. Even the most effective interventions did not lead to large improvements in adherence or clinical outcomes. </p> </section> <section id="CD000011-sec-0007"> <h3 class="title" id="CD000011-sec-0007">Authors' conclusions</h3> <p>Across the body of evidence, effects were inconsistent from study to study, and only a minority of lowest risk of bias RCTs improved both adherence and clinical outcomes. Current methods of improving medication adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized. The research in this field needs advances, including improved design of feasible long‐term interventions, objective adherence measures, and sufficient study power to detect improvements in patient‐important clinical outcomes. By making our comprehensive database available for sharing we hope to contribute to achieving these advances. </p> </section> </div> </section> <section class="pico-section" id="pico"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title">PICOs <i class="icon fa fa-info-circle" title="The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Assisting patients to adhere better to medicines could improve their health, and many studies have tested ways to achieve this. </p> <p><b>Question</b> </p> <p>We updated our review from 2007 to answer the question: What are the findings of high‐quality studies that tested ways to assist patients with adhering to their medicines? </p> <p><b>Search strategy</b> </p> <p>We retrieved studies published until 11 January 2013. To find relevant studies we searched six online databases and references in other reviews, and we contacted authors of relevant studies and reviews. </p> <p><b>Selection criteria</b> </p> <p>We selected studies reporting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a group receiving an intervention to improve medicine adherence with a group not receiving the intervention. We included trials if they measured both medicine adherence and a clinical outcome (e.g. blood pressure), with at least 80% of patients studied until the end. </p> <p><b>Main results</b> </p> <p>The studies differed widely regarding included patients, treatments, adherence intervention types, medicine adherence measurement, and clinical outcomes. Therefore, we could not combine the results in statistical analysis to reach general conclusions, as it would be misleading to suggest that they are comparable. Instead, we provide the key features and findings of each study in tables, and we describe intervention effects in studies of the highest quality. The present update included 109 new studies, bringing the total number to 182. In the 17 studies of the highest quality, interventions were generally complex with several different ways to try to improve medicine adherence. These frequently included enhanced support from family, peers, or allied health professionals such as pharmacists, who often delivered education, counseling, or daily treatment support. Only five of these RCTs improved both medicine adherence and clinical outcomes, and no common characteristics for their success could be identified. Overall, even the most effective interventions did not lead to large improvements. </p> <p><b>Authors' conclusions</b> </p> <p>Characteristics and effects of interventions to improve medicine adherence varied among studies. It is uncertain how medicine adherence can consistently be improved so that the full health benefits of medicines can be realized.

Only 17 RCTs had a low risk of bias for randomization and allocation concealment, and clinical outcome assessment; this low number is likely partly due to the fact that there was often insufficient detail provided to determine risk of bias. Among these 17 RCTs, only five improved both adherence and clinical outcome, which is comparable to the rate found among the 21 new RCTs in our previous update. If there is a common thread to these interventions, it is that they are complex and use frequent interaction with patients with a focus on adherence. However, these complex strategies for improving adherence with long‐term medication prescriptions are not very effective, despite the amount of effort and other resources they can consume. There is insufficient evidence at present to conclude that newer intervention types, such as mobile text messaging and Internet‐based care, can assist in improving adherence. There is no evidence that low adherence can be 'cured'. Thus, effective methods to improve adherence must be maintained for as long as the treatment is needed, requiring interventions that can be integrated into the care system in a cost‐effective manner. </p> </section> <h3 class="title" id="CD000011-sec-0064">Implications for research</h3> <section id="CD000011-sec-0064"> <p>Low adherence affects all self administered treatments, and as the numbers of efficacious treatments continue to grow, investments in fundamental and applied adherence research are likely to pay large dividends. It is possible that interventions to date are not very effective since we do not understand in sufficient detail exactly what the adherence problems are. Frameworks to assist in the development of complex interventions therefore advise preparatory qualitative assessments involving patients and other stakeholders, to understand better the problems and context (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0567" title="CraigP , DieppeP , MacintyreS , MichieS , NazarethI , PetticrewM . Developing and evaluating complex interventions: the new Medical Research Council guidance. BMJ2008;29(337):a1655. [DOI: 10.1136/bmj.a1655] ">Craig 2008</a>). </p> <p>Despite the steep increase in number of RCTs, the field of adherence improvement research has persistent methodological weaknesses. Rather than increasing the volume of research while repeating weaknesses, several study methodology issues need to be addressed to ensure that we are not missing any true effects or creating false positive findings. Investigators should make use of best‐in‐class adherence measures, such as prescription monitoring. More objective measures for adherence are needed to accurately determine intervention effects. Patients should be recruited because their adherence is low, not just because they are willing to participate. Researchers should design studies to minimize risk of bias as much as possible and clearly report their procedures, especially concerning co‐interventions, such as additional staff supported by research funds. Another priority is attaining sufficient study power for clinical outcomes that are important to patients. Around 40% of all studies were underpowered, with less than 60 patients per treatment group, and this was a comparable rate to the previous update. Smaller studies may be appropriate until an innovation appears to have clinically useful effects. At that point, the innovation should be tested in more substantial trials to document effects on clinically important outcomes (including adverse effects), feasibility in usual practice settings, and sustainability. If complex interventions show positive effects, it would be appropriate to test their components in factorial studies. </p> <p>A cure for non‐adherence is nowhere to be seen, but treatments that obviate the need for ongoing adherence, such as implantable treatments with minimal adverse effects (e.g. intrauterine devices) could be worth pursuing. Intervention components that could be explored further include well‐established and newer information and communication technologies on top of regular care, and specific or co‐ordinated roles for allied health professionals. </p> <p>Finally, it is essential that researchers stop re‐inventing the poorly performing 'wheels' of adherence interventions that we have seen to date. It seems that most adherence research is performed by clinicians and others who discover adherence problems while working within the context of the management of a specific disease condition, such as cardiovascular risk, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and the like. Low adherence with medications is a ubiquitous problem, found with self administered treatments for all medical conditions. Without considering what has been studied across disease conditions, researchers will find themselves with inadequate knowledge of what does not work, and will be unable to avoid repeating the painful lessons of adherence research to date. Rather, we need to begin with interventions that have shown some promise, or at least have not been tested with repeatedly negative results. The methods and innovations of adherence research must advance if we are to be able to help patients enjoy the benefits of modern therapeutics. </p> </section> </section> </section> <section class="background"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD000011-sec-0022" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Background <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> <div class="section-language-toggles"> <span class="section-languages-legend">available in</span> <nav class="section-languages"> <li class="section-language"> <a class="is-active" href="full/en#CD000011-sec-0022">English</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/es#CD000011-sec-0081">Español</a> </li> </nav> </div> </div> <section class="background" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD000011-sec-0022"></div> <section id="CD000011-sec-0023"> <h3 class="title" id="CD000011-sec-0023">Description of the condition</h3> <p>Low patient adherence is a major barrier to realizing the benefits of medications that have been shown to do more good than harm in clinical trials.

In recent years, research efforts to better understand the multifactorial barriers that influence patient adherence and to refine theoretical frameworks have been increasing. However, whether these efforts have led to the emergence of more effective interventions needs to be assessed by summarizing the high‐quality RCT evidence to date. Many systematic reviews have been published after our 2008 update, but all focused on a specific (demographic, disease, or medication) population, intervention, or on an even more specific combination of both. Generally, these reviews reported similar conclusions: some intervention components are potentially effective, but small sample sizes and suboptimal methodology often prevented strong conclusions; the variety of adherence measures limited study comparability; and most studies lacked a theoretical underpinning (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0587" title="vanDulmenS , SluijsE , vanDijkL , deRidderD , HeerdinkR , BensingJ .

When reporting results from individual studies, we cited the measures of association and P values reported in the studies. We interpreted P value &lt; 0.05 as indicating statistical significance. Due to the extreme heterogeneity in clinical conditions, participant selection criteria, medical regimens, interventions, adherence measures, and clinical outcome measures, pooling results according to any of these characteristics would still leave highly heterogeneous groups. In support of this, we refer to the meta‐analysis reported by the Ascertaining Barriers for Compliance (ABC) project team, which exclusively focused on RCTs that measured adherence by means of electronic medication event monitoring systems (MEMS) and still found a very high heterogeneity of effects (I<sup>2</sup> = 98.88%) (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0565" title="ABC Project Team.

">ABC Project Team 2012</a>). Pooling of effects in our review was further undermined by the frequent use of complex interventions, which was already problematic for categorizing intervention types in the previous update. Studies also had very heterogeneous clinical outcomes; they also often lacked clearly defined primary outcomes. We could not justify even plotting intervention effects without pooling in meta‐analysis, as this would imply some degree of comparability among the studies. Rather, as a best case alternative, we conducted a narrative analysis of the studies with the lowest risk of bias, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0575" title="HigginsJPT , AltmanDG , Sterne JAC(editors) .

Regarding peer support, clinic staff selected peer supporters who were also HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy, and had a high therapy adherence, regularly attended clinic visits, were socially skilled, and were able to participate in training and supervision. Peers were, as much as possible, matched to participants based on race/ethnicity, sex, and sexual orientation. During three months, aiming to use twice‐monthly group meetings and thrice‐weekly phone calls, peer supporters addressed barriers to medication adherence and potential solutions. Patients could choose to continue attending meetings and seeking assistance after three months. The three months pager intervention involved automated individually tailored interactive messaging, addressing medication adherence, education, entertainment, and adherence measurement. Messaging frequency could be tailored to the patient's preference with a minimum of three daily messages in the first two months, which was tapered in the third month. At three months, the only significant effect was for self reported adherence in the peer support group, compared with care as usual. No effects were found of either peer support or the pager intervention on self reported adherence, electronically monitored adherence, and viral load and CD4 count as reported in routine medical charts, at six and nine months. The one significant effect was likely a chance finding, considering the testing of multiple outcomes at different time points and the absence of confirmation by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS).

The psychotherapist and patient determined a visit schedule for the year, with a minimum of two sessions and maximum of 25 (median was 11). In addition, they would identify at least two treatment goals, of which medication adherence was one, which would be targeted with treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. The proportion of patients with adherence of 95% or greater as measured by MEMS, and self reported adherence as measured on a visual analog scale, was higher in the intervention group at 10 to 12 months, but the regression coefficients for change in MEMS adherence during the study were not different between intervention and control. Viral load and CD4 count were not different between groups, but the intervention group showed an improvement in mental state, as measured by a standardized questionnaire on experience and behavior.

Interventions for enhancing medication adherence. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2008, Issue 2. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000011.pub3] ">Haynes 2008</a>, with 109 new RCTs, a substantially larger number than expected from previous publication rates. To our knowledge this is the only comprehensive (not restricted to specific settings, medications, or diseases) systematic review of interventions to improve medication adherence based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed both adherence and clinical outcomes. Despite the more than two‐fold increase in the knowledge base, the interventions and findings of these RCTs only slightly alter the conclusions of the previous version of our review. Compared with the previous update, we now: 1) report a lack of convincing evidence among studies with the lowest risk of bias; 2) no longer try to classify studies according to intervention type; 3) make our database available for collaboration on sub‐analyses. The wide variety of settings, participants, intervention types, medications, adherence measures, and clinical outcomes precluded summarizing findings to reach reliable general conclusions. RCTs included in the current review reported effects that were inconsistent from study to study. A minority of lowest risk of bias RCTs reported improving both adherence and clinical outcome, but these typically had very complex interventions that would be difficult to implement in usual practice setting. Thus, as a qualitative generalization, methods of improving medication adherence for chronic health problems tested to date are mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized. Therefore, the quest for effective and practical interventions to promote medication adherence and improve clinical outcomes must continue. In acknowledgement of the need for collective advancement, we make our database available for collaboration on sub‐analyses. </p> <p>To the extent that they represent true innovation, the increase of trials is most encouraging. Even when outcomes were improved, however, the effects were generally small. Effects were seldom assessed on major clinical events such as death or hospitalization, and when done these were rarely significant, albeit possibly due to insufficient study power. The diversity, complexity, and uncertain effects of the interventions, as well as the often uncertain risk of bias for blinding treatment allocation and outcomes assessment, make generalizations about which interventions work and which do not problematic. </p> </section> <section id="CD000011-sec-0048"> <h3 class="title" id="CD000011-sec-0048">Quality of the evidence</h3> <p>Our narrative focused on the RCTs with the lowest risk of bias, to provide a reasonable sampling of the details and diversity of included trials. We identified only 17 studies as having a low risk of bias for study design and clinical outcome assessment. Their interventions were generally complex, trying to overcome multiple barriers to adherence by several means of tailored ongoing support. The lowest risk of bias RCTs primarily involved enhanced support from family, peers, or allied health professionals such as pharmacists, who often delivered intense education, counseling (including motivational interviewing or cognitive behavioral therapy by professionals), and/or daily treatment support. Of these RCTs, five improved both adherence and clinical outcomes, three improved only adherence outcomes, one improved only clinical outcomes, and eight did not improve adherence or clinical outcomes. This was a similar success rate to that found in the 21 newly included studies in the 2008 update (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0593" title="HaynesRB , AcklooE , SahotaN , McDonaldHP , YaoX . Interventions for enhancing medication adherence. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2008, Issue 2. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000011.pub3] ">Haynes 2008</a>). Whether these numbers reflect the actual proportion of studies that had an important effect is uncertain, and simple 'vote counting' is not informative because: </p> <p> <ol id="CD000011-list-0004"> <li> <p>a large variety of often complex interventions would be inappropriately treated as equal; </p> </li> <li> <p>many studies tested multiple outcomes without statistical correction, thereby increasing the risk of false positives findings; </p> </li> <li> <p>many studies were underpowered thereby potentially hiding a true effect;</p> </li> <li> <p>most outcomes were surrogate measures (e.g. blood pressure) rather than patient‐important outcomes. </p> </li> </ol> </p> <p>No common intervention characteristics for success were apparent among these studies. Therefore, even in the studies with the strongest methodology, no consistent evidence exists that medication adherence can be improved within the resources usually available in clinical settings, and that this will predictably lead to important improvements in treatment outcomes. The results might have been different with more relaxed criteria for participant loss to follow‐up, but this would further muddy the water with even lower‐quality RCTs, and we prefer to stand by our criteria of at least 80% follow‐up in all treatment groups. In addition, most studies enrolled patients who were willing to participate, rather than those that had low adherence. This makes it harder to show an effect, as opposed to applying the intervention only to those in need of adherence support. Although we were not able to assess potential publication bias, as we did not pool results, we estimate that some publication bias is likely due to the widespread lack of power to pick up potentially meaningful effects. If so, our low estimate of the benefits of interventions to date would likely only be reinforced by unpublished studies. </p> <section id="CD000011-sec-0049"> <h4 class="title">Interventions</h4> <section id="CD000011-sec-0050"> <h5 class="title">New developments</h5> <p>Since the last update, some new or little studied intervention types have been reported.

Further, no other RCTs testing the effect of internet‐based disease telemonitoring made it through our selection process. Although both technologies have great potential to reach large population groups to improve adherence, further rigorous testing is necessary. Ongoing studies might strengthen the knowledge base and provide more details on how they could be better utilized. The present examples overall do not change our conclusion from the previous update that adherence research is lagging behind the rapid developments in technology, and that research methodology and evidence on their optimal use remain weak. </p> <p>Allied healthcare providers such as nurses and pharmacists are increasingly delivering part of, or the entire intervention. In our previous update we advised further exploration of their role, and hypothesized that if their roles can be expanded to include counseling patients to enhance medication adherence, this may be feasible in practice. Considering that physicians have limited time, and sometimes skills, to counsel patients on medication adherence repeatedly, shifting these tasks to allied providers seems reasonable and potentially cost‐effective. Several complex interventions involving allied providers were effective, but since they were often only part of the intervention and delivered a variety of intervention enhancing services, their efficacy has to be determined for specific roles and tasks. In addition to the role of allied health professionals, several studies tested family/social interventions, lay health mentoring, or group meetings. It seems worthwhile to explore further involving non‐professional personnel, since the patient's social context is important to optimize chronic care, and might improve cost‐effectiveness. </p> <p>As mentioned, complex interventions were often used in the new RCTs, typically involving intensive ongoing allied health care provider and social support, sometimes facilitating transitions in care. This seems logical considering that adherence is generally a complicated matter caused by multi‐factorial barriers (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0565" title="ABC Project Team.

For example, pharmacists would be specifically allocated to the intervention and reimbursed accordingly, but outside this research setting they might not be able or willing to dedicate this time to the intervention. Even if a small effect on clinical outcomes was observed, it remains to be seen whether such interventions can be translated to other settings in a cost‐effective manner.

We will illustrate this with a selected example regarding cardiovascular prevention single‐pill combination therapies, also since a recent Cochrane systematic review by Ryan et al showed promise for simplified dosing (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0582" title="RyanR , SantessoN , LoweD , HillS , GrimshawJ , PrictorM , et al. Interventions to improve safe and effective medicines use by consumers: an overview of systematic reviews. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2014, Issue 4. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007768.pub3] ">Ryan 2014</a>). Several of these combination pills, containing multiple proven cardiovascular medications, have already been developed and tested versus the same medications as individual therapies (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0588" title="Working Group on the Summit on Combination Therapy for CVD. Combination pharmacotherapy to prevent cardiovascular disease: present status and challenges. European Heart Journal2014; Vol. 35, issue 6:353‐64. [DOI: 10.1093/eurheartj/eht407; PUBMED: 24288261] ">Working Group on the Summit of Combination Therapy</a>). These pills simplify therapy to only one pill per day, where most cardiovascular patients currently have to take at least four to five separate pills daily. The RCTs testing combination pills typically assessed effects on therapy persistence (e.g. not explicitly discontinuing), rather than daily pill adherence while still on medications, in addition to intermediate clinical outcomes such as blood pressure. However, an RCT published after our search showed that self reported adherence as well as intermediate clinical outcomes (blood pressure, lipid levels) were somewhat improved with a cardiovascular combination pill (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0586" title="ThomS , PoulterN , FieldJ , PatelA , PrabhakaranD , StantonA , et al.

JAMA2013;310(9):918‐29. [DOI: 10.1001/jama.2013.277064; PUBMED: 24002278] ">Thom 2013</a>). That said, medication was provided free to the combination pill intervention group, while control group participants had to fend for themselves in acquiring their medications (almost half lacked insurance coverage), leaving uncertainty as to whether the improved adherence was due to simplified therapy or facilitated access to medication and cost‐lowering. This study would be a candidate to make it into our next update, but the provision of polypills free of charge constitutes a more complex intervention than the authors highlighted. As a related example, in our previous review we indicated that there is some evidence that a dose frequency of one to two times per day may be associated with better adherence than three to four times per day, and advised better exploration of this dose frequency. None of the new RCTs with the lowest risk of bias addressed this issue, and we would like to highlight this important issue. </p> </section> </section> <section id="CD000011-sec-0052"> <h4 class="title">Measuring adherence and clinical outcomes</h4> <p>To determine applicability to patient care, we only selected studies that measured both adherence and treatment outcome. This requirement has received the criticism that this resulted in a more negative message than some would like to see. It has been suggested that the findings would be more upbeat and positive if we included studies that measured only adherence. This criticism does not pertain to the purpose of this review, that is, to determine whether adherence interventions make a difference to clinical outcomes. It simply cannot be assumed that measures to increase adherence do more good than harm, even if they increase adherence. Nevertheless, we do agree that investigators who seek to advance the methods for enhancing adherence may find promising leads from studies that do not meet our criteria for measurement of both adherence and clinical outcomes. </p> <p>Attempts to increase adherence can have adverse effects (loss of privacy and autonomy, increased adverse effects of treatments) (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0584" title="SimpsonSH , EurichDT , MajumdarSR , PadwalRS , TsuyukiRT , VarneyJ , et al. A meta‐analysis of the association between adherence to drug therapy and mortality. BMJ2006;333(7557):15. ">Simpson 2006</a>), and so on. Few RCTs assessed such potential adverse effects. Further, many interventions with an effect on adherence and surrogate clinical outcomes measured relatively short‐term outcomes, typically at 6 to 12 months, which does not mean that their effect would be sustained or that they would lead to important clinical outcomes in the long run. </p> <section id="CD000011-sec-0053"> <h5 class="title">Adherence measures</h5> <p>A well‐known problem with adherence studies is the inability to measure adherence accurately and reliably, making it harder to pick up true differences, which could have contributed to the variable effects we observed among RCTs. Most studies used patient self report measures, which are known to overestimate adherence (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0571" title="GordisL . Conceptual and methodologic problems in measuring compliance. In: HaynesRB , TaylorDW , SackettDL editor(s). Compliance in Health Care. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979:23‐5. ">Gordis 1979</a>; <a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0573" title="HaynesRB , TaylorDW , SackettDL , GibsonES , BernholzCD , MukherjeeJ . Can simple clinical measurements detect patient compliance?. Hypertension1980;2:757‐64. ">Haynes 1980</a>; <a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0585" title="StephensonBJ , RoweBH , MachariaWM , LeonG , HaynesRB . Is this patient taking their medication?. JAMA1993;269:2779‐81. ">Stephenson 1993</a>); these studies are at especially high risk of bias when the patient is not blinded to the treatment allocation, which is usually the case. Some validated questionnaires are available, and should be used as much as possible if self report is chosen, but their accuracy and reliability are often limited and depend on the context they are used in. </p> <p>Increasingly, studies are using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) pill bottle caps. These caps contain a microchip that measures the date and time at which the bottles are opened, but do not register if the patient actually took the medication on those occasions. Although this method is more objective than self report, it could also function as an intervention (patients feel monitored) (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0566" title="ChristensenA , OsterbergLG , HansenEH . Electronic monitoring of patient adherence to oral antihypertensive medical treatment: a systematic review. Journal of Hypertension2009;27(8):1540‐51. [PUBMED: 19474761] ">Christensen 2009</a>), and increase adherence in both groups, thus diminishing or concealing a true difference. It can also be 'gamed' by the patient who is aware of the MEMS function and wishes to keep non‐adherence private. </p> <p>A potentially more objective measure that was used in some studies was pill count, which is especially appealing if it is done unannounced, at home, and in an unobtrusive way, in order to prevent patient awareness and anticipation of pill count. However, most pill counts are done on containers that the patient brings with them to a visit to a health professional, and in this circumstance counts can clearly be altered by the patient. </p> <p>A method that was regularly used, and that probably has the highest likelihood of maintaining blinding of patients and providers, was the use of routine pharmacy refill records. Although this method depends on the assumption that the patient is actually consuming the medication, and the only one doing so, it better allows adequate blinding of outcome assessors. In our view, using more objective measures such as pharmacy records is a productive step forward in the field of adherence research, as it will lead to further valid and reliable results. With electronic records available in most pharmacies, this option is increasingly available, inexpensive, and acceptable, providing that patient consent is obtained. </p> <p>It is important to note that our review may miss the most severe form of non‐adherence, among those who do not attend for needed care or enter trials. Patients dropping out of care are unlikely to be receiving any medication, and if those in care average about 50% adherence, keeping patients in care is arguably the most important adherence intervention at present. The same rationale can be used for keeping patients on medication, even if they do not attend clinic visits. Both assume, however, that for those who are prevented from dropping out or discontinuing medication, or who are returned to care or restart medication by intervention, adherence rates are sufficient to achieve clinically important benefits. This merits further testing. </p> </section> <section id="CD000011-sec-0054"> <h5 class="title">Clinical outcomes</h5> <p>Consistent with the large variety in diseases and medications, many different clinical outcomes were reported. Most RCTs measured intermediate biological outcomes, such as blood pressure, serum cholesterol or HIV‐1 RNA, or patient‐reported outcomes such as quality of life, knowledge, beliefs, or attitudes. Very few studies examined major, patient‐important, clinical endpoints such as death or hospitalization. The latter have the lowest risk of bias, as they are obvious and can easily be verified. Intermediate biological outcomes also often have a low risk of bias, although this could be compromised if measurement methods differ among subjects, and outcome assessors are not blinded. For example, measuring blood pressure requires a protocol whereby a fixed number of measurements are taken according to a standardized process, and a provider who is aware of a participant being in the intervention group might (subconsciously or otherwise) alter this process or interpret readings differently. Self reported outcomes such as symptoms and quality of life are more prone to bias, even if using well‐validated general and disease‐specific tools to assess them. Finally, many studies reported self reported knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes, often in addition to more objective clinical outcomes. Although these types of outcomes can be used to further clarify mechanisms of effects, they are often not validated or inadequately validated, are prone to self report or observer bias, and their measurement varies with time and clinical care experiences which limits their reliability. </p> </section> </section> <section id="CD000011-sec-0055"> <h4 class="title">Study power</h4> <p>Many RCTs had inadequate power to detect a meaningful difference in adherence, and this did not seem to be improved among newly identified RCTs. As a general guide, studies with a single intervention group and control group would need to include at least 60 participants per group if they are to have at least 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 25% in the proportion of patients judged to have adequate adherence. According to this rule, the new RCTs were as likely to be underpowered (40% (44/109)) as RCTs in the previous update, and even among the 17 lowest risk of bias RCTs in the present update, four had insufficient power (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0061" title="HaynesRB , SackettDL , GibsonES , TaylorDW , HackettBC , RobertsRS , et al.

British Journal of Psychiatry2011;199(6):467‐72. [MEDLINE: 22130748] ">Farooq 2011</a>). For example, in a study of 38 patients (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0061" title="HaynesRB , SackettDL , GibsonES , TaylorDW , HackettBC , RobertsRS , et al. Improvement of medication compliance in uncontrolled hypertension. Lancet1976;1(7972):1265‐8. ">Haynes 1976</a>), there was a significant increase in adherence associated with the intervention and an interesting within‐group reduction of blood pressure within the intervention group. However, the difference between the intervention and control groups for blood pressure change was not statistically significant. Underpowered studies are more likely to miss a meaningful difference in adherence, even when improving adherence substantially, and showing an effect on clinical outcomes is likely even harder. This is especially true for major events. If RCTs with hundreds or thousands of participants are needed to show that the medication has an effect on major outcomes compared with usual care, it is unlikely that improving adherence among patients who are prescribed the medication will have a substantial effect on major outcomes in a small sample size. </p> </section> <section id="CD000011-sec-0056"> <h4 class="title">Quality of reporting</h4> <p>Many articles did not provide sufficient detail to allow the risk of bias to be determined, or for the exact nature of what the study tested to be understood. In particular, details of the methods of random sequence generation, concealment of treatment allocation, and blinding of the outcome assessors as relevant for the outcomes were often not reported, and therefore we could not determine the risk of bias. As a consequence, it is possible that some of RCTs that we excluded from our narrative actually had a low risk of bias, but we were unable to determine this based on the manuscript, supplements, and (absence of) author response. The importance of adequate reporting is further illustrated by the initially included RCTs that were eventually discarded due to less than 80% follow‐up after repeated detailed review. The way these studies were reported was sometimes confusing for something as simple as follow‐up rate, and the full picture was only revealed after reading all the details, tables, figures, or supplements. Examples appear in the listing of studies excluded for cause in this review. </p> <p>Treatment arms, both intervention and control, were also not always described in sufficient detail. For example, while the report might state clearly that patients received reminders, the method of administering the reminder program might not be described, or might be described in some part of the text other than the section on the intervention. Most studies paid research staff to administer interventions, raising issues in generalizability to usual practice settings. This also raised the issue of attribution in many studies: if the control group received 'usual care', there would be no 'attention control' in the study and any effects observed could be due to either the intervention proper or simply the non‐specific effects of increased attention paid to the intervention group. Furthermore, some studies reported that the patients in the control group received 'usual care', but did not describe what that encompassed. If the standard medical care is already performing relatively well, it will be harder to show an improvement with the intervention. Therefore, to understand the trial results better, it is recommended to provide sufficient details on the intervention design and delivery, the assumed change process the intervention aims to deliver, and the care process for the control group, whether this was an active control or usual care (<a href="./references#CD000011-bbs2-0578" title="MichieS , FixsenD , GimshawJM , EcclesMP .

With other eligibility criteria, such as allowing a larger loss to follow‐up or not requiring clinical outcome, the review results might have been different. In addition, in the absence of clear study details, we could have made judgment calls in our 'Risk of bias' assessment to avoid too many 'uncertain risk' assignments. This might have resulted in more studies being considered 'low risk', and therefore eligible for discussion in our main text. However, we anticipate that the quality of evidence in these trials would be even lower than the moderate study quality which was found in both the overall review and among the RCTs with the lowest risk of bias, and would lead us further from an accurate overview of the current best evidence in a field with a large number of small and low quality studies. </p> </section> <section id="CD000011-sec-0060"> <h4 class="title">Other reviews</h4> <p>Our review is restricted to prescribed medications, excluding those prescribed for addiction, and to studies that assessed both adherence and treatment outcomes. There are many other systematic reviews of adherence interventions, too numerous to list, especially for specific clinical conditions, and also for non‐medication interventions (e.g. diet, exercise, addictions, and so on). We acknowledge that systematic reviews focusing on specific clinical conditions, medications, or intervention types might draw different conclusions. We chose to focus on all RCTs testing adherence interventions for any self administered therapy, to get a complete overview of the field and to account for the fact that adherence problems are often comparable for different medications. This resulted in the inclusion of a large variety of heterogeneous RCTs that could not reliably be pooled, but we encourage reviewers and researchers who find a signal for effective interventions for a specific condition or medication to share their findings with us and other reviewers. In addition, we invite reviewers interested in specific conditions, medications, or interventions to propose such a specific analysis in our comprehensive database. </p> </section> <section id="CD000011-sec-0061"> <h4 class="title">Sharing of review data</h4> <p>As indicated, we did not feel it scientifically justified to summarize data across studies, but provided all the details on included RCTs in the tables, as well as a narrative of the RCTs with the lowest risk of bias.

PS comprised 4 30‐minute sessions. The individualized intervention involved 4 interactive steps, usually 1 per research session. For the 158 participants who reported missing doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the goal was to improve adherence. For the 7 participants who declared adherence to the prescribed regimen, the goal was to maintain adherence. The first PS step consisted of defining the problem: improving or preserving adherence to ICS use within the patient's unique context and orientation. Problem orientation facilitated the adoption of a rational, positive, and constructive appraisal of how to achieve adherence, with non‐adherence being presented as a problem to be solved. PS was presented as a means of coping with problems more generally and modifying attitudes or beliefs that inhibit or interfere with attempts to solve problems. It was a motivational technique to help the participant view the occurrence of problems as inevitable, normal, and solvable. This first step involved breaking problems into small achievable pieces. The second step was brainstorming for alternative solutions. The third step was choosing the best solution by weighing the consequences, both desirable and undesirable, of each candidate solution. Between the third and 4th meetings, the solution was tried. For the 4th step, the chosen solution was evaluated and revised. As part of this intervention, downloaded data from monitored ICSs were shared with the participant in a nonjudgmental fashion at each visit. At these sessions, subjects followed the same PS steps for addressing an additional problem of their own choosing, such as increasing physical activity.

During their visit, the patients were given the chance to view the progression of their disease on the computer, discuss the changes in their disease activity parameters, comorbidity risks, functional disability, and quality of life. The patients were assessed at 3‐month intervals for another 6 months (unless they sustained a flare up of their condition, at which time they would be reviewed earlier).

Treatment intensity was increased for patients failing to respond to lower levels of care by involving a greater number of intervention personnel with increasing mental health expertise. The intervention involved 5 types of providers: (1) PCPs located at CBOCs; 2) consult telepsychiatrists located at parent VAMCs; (3) an off‐site depression nurse care manager (RN); (4) an off‐site clinical pharmacist (PharmD); and 5) an off‐site supervising psychiatrist. The consult‐telepsychiatrist accepted consultations or referrals from PCPs. The supervising psychiatrist provided clinical supervision to the care manager and clinical pharmacist via weekly face‐to‐face meetings. Patients and providers could choose either watchful waiting or antidepressant treatment (Step 1). Nurse care manager encounters were conducted via telephone and were scripted to enhance standardization and reproducibility. During the initial care management encounter, patients were: (1) administered the PHQ9 symptom monitoring tool; (2) educated and activated using a semi‐structured script4; and 3) assessed for treatment barriers using semi‐structured scripts for endorsed barriers. Follow‐up encounters to monitor symptoms, medication adherence, and side effects were scheduled every 2 weeks during acute treatment and every 4 weeks during watchful waiting or continuation treatment. Non‐adherent patients or those experiencing severe side effects were administered semi‐structured scripts.3 A trial was considered to have failed in the acute phase if the patient: (1) was non‐adherent to the medication, (2) experienced severe side effects, (3) experienced 5‐point increase in their PHQ9 score, or (4) did not respond (50% decrease in PHQ9 score) after 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy. All feedback was provided to PCPs using the electronic medical record. Progress notes reporting failed trials requested an electronic co‐signature from the PCP. If the patient did not respond to the initial antidepressant, the pharmacist conducted a medication history and provided pharmacotherapy recommendations to PCPs via an electronic progress note (Step 2). The pharmacist also provided non‐scripted medication management over the phone to patients experiencing severe side effects or problems with non‐adherence.

During a reminder call, patients could be transferred automatically to their peer partner's number. The system also allowed patients to leave voice messages for research staff or care managers.

Intervention patients were educated individually by the clinical pharmacist (in a structured fashion) on COPD, their prescribed medication, the importance of adherence, inhaler technique (written information was provided) and the management of COPD symptoms. The clinical pharmacist ensured that the patient knew the indications and doses of each medicine, and was able and willing to use the inhaler devices prescribed. The clinical pharmacist also discussed with the intervention patients the importance of simple exercises that patients can do at home (e.g. upper and lower limb exercises and relaxation techniques), symptom control (pursed lip technique) and the technique for expectoration (huff and puff technique). The pharmacist demonstrated these techniques and then asked the patients to carry out the techniques to ensure that they fully understood how to perform them. A booklet on these techniques was prepared to assist in the education session and the patients were given a copy to take home with them. Advice, using the motivational interviewing technique, was provided to the patients who still smoked and referral to a special smoking cessation program run within the hospital was made. A customized action plan for acute exacerbations, including advice to GPs to provide a prescription for an antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and an oral corticosteroid to be initiated promptly by patients for exacerbations,was developed for each patient. The clinical pharmacist through motivational interviewing attempted to increase the intervention patients' self efficacy to manage or avoid breathing difficulty while participating in certain activities. The interventions were tailored according to the preliminary assessment, i.e. checklists of patients' needs were prepared by the research pharmacist and forwarded to the clinical pharmacist to discuss with the patients. The initial intervention lasted for approximately 1 hour for non‐smoker patients and slightly longer for patients who currently smoked. At each outpatient clinic visit (every 6 months arranged by the hospital consultant), intervention group patients received reinforcement of the education on COPD and its treatment from the clinical pharmacist.

The treatment supporters were usually family members—usually a partner, mother, daughter, sister, brother, friend, or neighbor/friend—who were chosen by the patient with the assistance of the health workers, had accepted the patient's HIV status and were confidantes. These individuals were committed to support the patient with ART for a long time, had gained the patient's trust over time, and commanded respect. Patients were asked to bring their chosen treatment supporter to the ART clinic for the health worker to explain about ART, adherence and treatment support.

The data were provided to both the subject and his/her clinician as a printout summarizing the percent of doses taken, the percent of doses taken on time, and a visual display of doses taken by time. This process of flagging and counseling was specific to each clinic visit. In each counseling session, the clinician reviewed the EDM printout with the subject, explored reasons for missed or off‐time doses, and inquired about problems or challenges the subject might be having. Beyond this, counseling sessions did not follow a script. This was designed to accommodate each clinician's counseling style, allow for an individually‐focused discussion of adherence behavior, and encourage each subject‐clinician pair to devise personalized strategies to improving adherence. In this regard, the EDM feedback provided data to inform and thereby enhance the counseling, but did not dictate precisely how the counseling should be performed.

They also believed that clinic visits would provide beneficial access to health care workers, so M‐DOT services were provided during twice weekly clinic visits. To enhance convenience, participants could select 1 of 6 health centers for their M‐DOT visits. At each visit, participants met with M‐DOT observers (nurses) who observed ingestion of the patient's ART dose, inquired about difficulties encountered, and provided individualized adherence support. Used medication containers were also collected, pill counts recorded, and medication dispensed for the subsequent 3 or 4 days. During the monthly clinic visits, efforts were made to ensure that participants in the M‐DOT and control group received equal contact time with study staff to minimize the likelihood that any differences observed would be due to nonspecific effects of increased attention given to the intervention group.

Monitoring contacts were scheduled 2, 6, and 10weeks later. At each monitoring contact, there was an outreach message from the nurse containing a link to an online assessment. The assessment included the PHQ depression questionnaire and questions regarding use of antidepressant medication, side effects, and reasons for medication discontinuation. Those not responding were sent up to 2 reminder messages. For each assessment completed, an algorithm generated a suggested response based on PHQ depression score, current antidepressant use, and side effects. The care manager could tailor this suggested response using information in the medical record or in messages since the last contact. The care manager communicated with the treating physician using an electronic messaging system within the electronic medical record. In consultation with the physician, the care manager might facilitate follow‐up visits, support changes in medication, or facilitate referral for specialty care (including urgent referrals in case of suicidal ideation or severe symptoms). Each of the 3 care management contacts included this cycle: outreach message from the care manager, patient completion of online assessment, structured response from the care manager, and follow‐up communication with the patient and physician as needed. The care manager's messages to patients included brief support but no formal psychotherapy. Patients were free to send additional messages or telephone the care manager if needed.

At the time of enrollment, participants were assigned to individual peers by study staff based on peer availability and presumed compatibility. In the group setting, participants had the opportunity to interact face‐to‐face with their assigned peer and meet the other peers and participants, with the goal of benefiting from the discussion of the shared experiences of the group. The meetings were designed to identify barriers to HAART adherence and generate problem‐solving strategies to overcome them. Other emerging themes included life issues that impact adherence, including HIV status disclosure, dating, substance use, and struggles with mental health issues. One of several research staff members coordinated the groups by making reminder phone calls, preparing the meeting room, and providing refreshments. With assistance from the peers, they facilitated the meetings by refocusing the discussion on adherence‐related topics when appropriate. Otherwise, they refrained from interfering with the group process and the exchange of support among peers and participants, resulting in predominantly peer led groups. Participants received a $15 incentive for attending each of the 6 sessions. All were welcomed to continue attending thereafter but were provided neither reminder phone calls nor monetary incentives for additional meetings. Between group meetings, peers were instructed to call each of their study participants weekly to provide more in‐depth one‐on‐one attention and feedback. Phone calls also were better suited for participants with confidentiality concerns and those who had difficulty traveling to the clinic or had scheduling conflicts with the set meeting times.

A computer program allowed for the timing of all text messages to be specified up front and then sent automatically without any further intervention from study staff. At randomization, the study co‐ordinator distributed a 2‐way pager and customized a message schedule to the participant's daily medication regimen, which was confirmed by the clinic pharmacist. In addition to dose reminders, 3 other types of text messages were sent: (1) educational; (2) entertainment (jokes or thoughts for the day); and (3) adherence assessments. There was some flexibility in the frequency and content of messages to accommodate participants' differing needs and schedules, but there was a minimum of 3 pager messages sent daily to participants for the first 2 months. Pages gradually tapered in the last month of the 3‐month intervention to avoid a rebound in non‐adherence. A confirmation return page was requested for every message sent. Project staff periodically reviewed the return page log and if no responses were received, the participant could be called to determine if they were having any problems with the pager. Between the first contact and the end of the 3‐month intervention, the participants were asked to wear the pager at all waking moments. Participants had to use the study pagers and could not substitute with their own pager or cell phone. They were instructed not to use the devices for personal use. Participants could select from a variety of auditory alarms or a vibrate‐only option if desired.

The HAART protocol involves a series of 3 separate appointments with a pharmacist, nutritionist, and case manager after an initial meeting with a provider and before a final meeting when the provider decides whether to prescribe HAART. During these preliminary interviews, patients are given social and mental health referrals as appropriate, a daily medication schedule, and information on medication side effects and techniques to help manage them.

The alarm device was either a cell phone (if the patient so chose) or a small battery powered electronic alarm device. In either case, the project staff helped the patient set up the device of their choice. Counseling was delivered by a bachelor level nurse. In accordance with a manualized protocol, the counseling sessions involved a cognitive‐behavioral and problem‐solving approach to: (1) enhancing motivation for treatment continuation, (2) learning about antiretroviral medication and the prescribed regimen, (3) keeping appointments, (4) communicating with healthcare providers, (5) formulating a daily medication schedule, (6) storing medications, (7) setting reminder strategies, (8) coping with side effects, (9) securing family and social support, (10) handing adherence lapses, and (11) addressing additional barriers. Participants could also invite a treatment partner to attend the counseling sessions with them. A ''treatment partner'' was defined as someone to whom the participant had already disclosed their HIV status and who was available to assist the participant on a daily basis. Participants who opted to have counseling, either individually or with a treatment adherence partner, had 3 counseling sessions of up to 1 hour each with the study nurse.

CAT strategies are tailored to the specific cognitive impairments and behavioral approaches to goal‐directed activity exhibited by each participant. Environmental supports in Full‐CAT treatment were based upon an assessment of neurocognitive function, behavior, adaptive functioning, and the environment. Interventions for each functional deficit were based on 2 dimensions, (1) level of impairment in executive functions and (2) whether the overt behavior of the individual during performance of goal‐directed activity was characterized more by apathy, disinhibition, or a combination of these styles. According to the CAT model, individuals with poor executive functioning need high levels of structure and more obviously placed environmental cues, while those with somewhat better executive functioning need less structure and more subtle cues. Individuals with apathetic behavior benefit from environmental supports that cue and sequence behavior, those with disinhibition benefit most from the removal of distracting stimuli, and those with mixed behavior benefit from a combination of these strategies. Assessment results yield one of 6 CAT classifications for which interventions can be targeted. Once an individual's CAT classification was determined, strategies for specific functional problems were chosen from the manual. CAT interventions were established, trained, and maintained in the home during weekly visits from a CAT therapist/trainer. Patients in Full‐CAT were seen once weekly for 30 to 45 minutes.
