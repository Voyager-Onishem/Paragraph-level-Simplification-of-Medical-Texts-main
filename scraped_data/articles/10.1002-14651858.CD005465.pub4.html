Overall, we included 95 trials (138,164 participants), 71 (40,374 participants; mean age 84 years; 75% women) in care facilities and 24 (97,790 participants; mean age 78 years; 52% women) in hospitals. The majority of trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, mostly relating to lack of blinding. With few exceptions, the quality of evidence for individual interventions in either setting was generally rated as low or very low. Risk of fracture and adverse events were generally poorly reported and, where reported, the evidence was very low‐quality, which means that we are uncertain of the estimates. Only the falls outcomes for the main comparisons are reported here. </p> <p><b>Care facilities</b> </p> <p>Seventeen trials compared exercise with control (typically usual care alone). We are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls (RaR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.20; 2002 participants, 10 studies; I² = 76%; very low‐quality evidence). Exercise may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; 2090 participants, 10 studies; I² = 23%; low‐quality evidence). </p> <p>There is low‐quality evidence that general medication review (tested in 12 trials) may make little or no difference to the rate of falls (RaR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.35; 2409 participants, 6 studies; I² = 93%) or the risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.09; 5139 participants, 6 studies; I² = 48%). </p> <p>There is moderate‐quality evidence that vitamin D supplementation (4512 participants, 4 studies) probably reduces the rate of falls (RaR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95; I² = 62%), but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; I² = 42%). The population included in these studies had low vitamin D levels. </p> <p>Multifactorial interventions were tested in 13 trials. We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls (RaR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.18; 3439 participants, 10 studies; I² = 84%; very low‐quality evidence). They may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05; 3153 participants, 9 studies; I² = 42%; low‐quality evidence). </p> <p><b>Hospitals</b> </p> <p>Three trials tested the effect of additional physiotherapy (supervised exercises) in rehabilitation wards (subacute setting). The very low‐quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of additional physiotherapy on the rate of falls (RaR 0.59, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.34; 215 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%), or whether it reduces the risk of falling (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.93; 83 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%). </p> <p>We are uncertain of the effects of bed and chair sensor alarms in hospitals, tested in two trials (28,649 participants) on rate of falls (RaR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.34; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence) or risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.24; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). </p> <p>Multifactorial interventions in hospitals may reduce rate of falls in hospitals (RaR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.01; 44,664 participants, 5 studies; I² = 52%). A subgroup analysis by setting suggests the reduction may be more likely in a subacute setting (RaR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; 3747 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the risk of falling (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 39,889 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). </p> </section> <section id="CD005465-sec-0007"> <h3 class="title" id="CD005465-sec-0007">Authors' conclusions</h3> <p>In care facilities: we are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls and it may make little or no difference to the risk of falling.

Effective interventions to prevent falls are therefore important. Many types of interventions are in use. These include exercise, medication interventions that include vitamin D supplementation and reviews of the drugs that people are taking, environment or assistive technologies including bed or chair alarms or the use of special (low/low) beds, social environment interventions that target staff members and changes in the organisational system, and knowledge interventions. A special type of intervention is the multifactorial intervention, where the selection of single interventions such as exercise and vitamin D supplementation is based on an assessment of a person's risk factors for falling. Falls are reported in two ways in our review. One outcome is rate of falls, which is the number of falls. The other outcome is risk of falling, which is the number of people who had one or more falls. </p> <p><b>Search date</b> </p> <p>We searched the healthcare literature for reports of randomised controlled trials relevant to this review up to August 2017. </p> <p><b>Study characteristics</b><br/> This review included 95 randomised controlled trials involving 138,164 participants. Seventy‐one trials (40,374 participants) were in care facilities, and 24 (97,790 participants) in hospitals. On average, participants were 84 years old in care facilities and 78 years old in hospitals. In care facilities, 75% were women and in hospitals, 52% were women. </p> <p><b>Quality of the evidence</b><br/> The majority of trials were at high risk of bias, mostly relating to lack of blinding. With few exceptions, the quality of evidence for individual interventions in either setting was generally rated as low or very low. Risk of fracture and adverse events were generally poorly reported and, where reported, the evidence was very low quality, which means that we are uncertain of the estimates. </p> <p><b>Key results</b> </p> <p>There was evidence, often from single studies, for a wide range of interventions used for preventing falls in both settings. However, in the following we summarise only the falls outcomes for four key interventions in care facilities and three key interventions in hospitals. </p> <p><i><b>Care facilities</b> </i><br/> We are uncertain of the effect of exercise on the rate of falls (very low‐quality evidence) and it may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (low‐quality evidence).<br/> General medication review may make little or no difference to the rate of falls (low‐quality evidence) or the risk of falling (low‐quality evidence).<br/> Prescription of vitamin D probably reduces the rate of falls (moderate‐quality evidence) but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling (moderate‐quality evidence). The population included in these studies appeared to have low vitamin D levels.<br/> We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls (very low‐quality evidence). They may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (low‐quality evidence). </p> <p><i><b>Hospitals</b> </i><br/> We are uncertain whether physiotherapy aimed specifically at reducing falls in addition to usual rehabilitation in the ward has an effect on the rate of falls or reduces the risk of falling (very low‐quality evidence).<br/> We are uncertain of the effect of bed alarms on the rate of falls or risk of falling (very low‐quality evidence).<br/> Multifactorial interventions may reduce the rate of falls, although this is more likely in a rehabilitation or geriatric ward setting (low‐quality evidence).

Interventions may target risk factors in participants or target staff and clinicians with the aim of improving clinical practice or the organisation of care. In some studies, single interventions have been evaluated while in others, interventions with more than one component have been evaluated. Delivery of multiple‐component interventions may be based on individual assessment of risk (a multifactorial intervention) or the same components are provided to all participants (a multiple intervention). A taxonomy has been developed to describe and classify types of intervention (<a href="./references#CD005465-bbs2-0278" title="LambSE , HauerK , BeckerC .

Since all the outcomes collected in our review are susceptible to the same risk of bias, we have not assessed outcomes for risk of detection bias or completeness of outcome data separately.

In hospitals, the level of care was subdivided by acute versus subacute or mixed levels of care.

For all comparisons where there were two or more trials, GRADE assessment was performed independently by two review authors and disagreement was resolved by discussion, or by adjudication with a third review author. We adopted a different approach for single trial comparisons, where we started with the assumption that the quality of evidence was likely to be very low. This reflected assumptions of downgrading at a minimum for serious risk of bias (typically performance and detection bias), for serious indirectness (trial being conducted was a single trial or setting), and for serious imprecision (failure to meet the 200 to 300 events optimal size criteria) (<a href="./references#CD005465-bbs2-0260" title="GuyattGH , OxmanAD , KunzR , BrozekJ , Alonso‐CoelloP , RindD , et al.

Despite the addition of 35 trials (77,869 participants) to the previous review, many of the results from the pooled analyses remain inconsistent and inconclusive. Although 24 trials reported data on fractures suitable for use in the analyses, all fracture data were very low‐quality evidence and thus we are uncertain of the effects of any intervention on risk of fracture. Twenty‐nine trials clearly reported data on adverse events, although in several it was to report an absence of adverse events. There were very few serious adverse events and minor complications, where reported, were usually similar in the intervention and control groups. Overall, we are uncertain of the effects on adverse events as the quality of the evidence has been assessed as very low. </p> <section id="CD005465-sec-0165"> <h4 class="title">Care facilities</h4> <section id="CD005465-sec-0166"> <h5 class="title">Exercise</h5> <p>Twenty‐five trials in care facilities investigated exercise as a single intervention. Despite the large number of trials, many were small (&lt; 100 participants). Only two trials reported the effects of exercise on risk of fracture and nine on adverse events. </p> <p>Seventeen trials compared an exercise intervention with usual care. A summary of the evidence for exercise in comparison with usual care in care facilities is provided in <a href="./full#CD005465-tbl-0001">summary of findings Table for the main comparison</a>. Funnel plots of the pooled trials (10 trials each for rate of falls and risk of falling; plus positive findings in an additional four trials reporting rate of falls that could not be pooled) indicated potential publication bias for this comparison. </p> <p>In the 10 trials of exercise compared with usual care that were pooled reporting rate of falls, there was considerable heterogeneity in the results, which was only partially explained by a subgroup analysis grouping trials according to level of nursing care provided. We are uncertain whether exercise had an effect on the rate of falls in care facilities as the quality of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Subgroup analyses by type of exercise did not explain the heterogeneity. </p> <p>There was less statistical heterogeneity in the data on risk of falling for trials of exercise compared with usual care. Pooled data indicated exercise may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (low‐quality evidence). </p> <p>There was limited evidence for exercise types other than gait, balance and functional training or trials testing a combination of exercise categories in comparison with usual care. Whilst three trials tested Tai Chi programmes (which have been demonstrated to be effective at reducing the risk of falling in a community setting), data were not suitable for pooling. </p> <p>We are uncertain of the impact of exercise on the risk of fracture or adverse events (very low‐quality evidence). </p> <p>Nine trials provided 12 comparisons of two different exercise programmes. Comparisons of different types of exercise were all considered of very low quality so we are uncertain of the relative effectiveness of different types of exercise. </p> <p>While no clear effect on reduction in falls from exercise was identified within the current review, either overall or by subgroups according to level of care or type of exercise, there was a high degree of heterogeneity between the studies. The range of different types of exercise, populations and settings investigated plus the small size of many trials has resulted in only limited evidence being available for any particular combination of these factors. Importantly, the limited evidence does not represent convincing evidence of a lack of effect and the possibility of some types, intensity or duration of exercise being effective for specific populations remains. </p> </section> <section id="CD005465-sec-0167"> <h5 class="title">Medication (drug target)</h5> <section id="CD005465-sec-0168"> <h6 class="title">Medication review</h6> <p>Twelve studies examined medication review in care facilities.

Pooled results from five trials of general medication review indicated that this intervention may make little or no difference to the rate of falls or risk of falling (low‐quality evidence).

Five trials examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation, two trials investigated the effect of daily multivitamin supplementation which included vitamin D and calcium and one tested an education intervention aimed at increasing prescription of adequate levels of vitamin D, calcium and osteoporosis medications.

Vitamin D supplementation probably reduces the rate of falls (moderate‐quality evidence) but vitamin D supplementation (with or without calcium) probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling (moderate‐quality evidence). The 28% reduction in falls rate observed (RaR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95) is substantial. Average serum vitamin D levels at baseline were reported to be low or very low in seven of eight studies (including the five studies of vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation), indicating that these results are applicable to residents of care facilities with low vitamin D levels.

Two studies reported data on the risk of fracture and no studies reported adverse‐event data. None of the interventions showed strong evidence for a reduction in falls. These interventions included staff education on fall and fracture prevention, a project nurse facilitating best‐practice falls injury prevention strategies, guideline implementation (falls, urinary tract infection, and pressure ulcers), dementia care mapping, a risk‐assessment tool versus nurses' judgement and a programme to improve staff connections, communication, and problem‐solving. Results were inconsistent in two trials of dementia care mapping.

All trials compared a multifactorial intervention with 'usual care', which in many cases included some falls‐prevention activities.

However, many of these were small and whilst there were a number of trials examining balance, gait or functional training exercise programmes, there were few trials on flexibility, strength/resistance training and 3D exercise (including Tai Chi). There were several comparisons of different exercise programs; however, there was generally only one small trial for each comparison so the data were too few to be informative. </p> <p>The quality of available evidence for vitamin D supplementation was reasonable (moderate‐quality evidence). However, there were few studies of vitamin D supplementation taken in the form of a multivitamin. Trials of environmental/assistive technologies and social environment (e.g. staff training, service model changes) generally studied clinically different interventions, precluding pooling of trial results. Whilst there was a very large trial of bed alarms conducted in hospitals, this trial was of education, training and support for their use and there were no trials of bed alarms in care facilities.

Many studies reporting data suitable for pooling reported data for one but not both of these outcomes. This may explain some of the inconsistency between the findings. Even fewer studies reported the impact of the interventions on fractures or adverse events. Within those studies that did report on adverse events, it was often unclear if these data were recorded systematically. Studies that reported data on fractures reported outcomes for different types of fractures (e.g. hip fractures only versus total fractures). Other studies not eligible for inclusion in this review may provide additional evidence for the impact of the interventions on fractures. In particular, whilst a larger proportion of included studies reported data on the risk of fracture following vitamin D supplementation, it is important to consider that these trials represent only a subset of the studies evaluating the effect of vitamin D on fractures available. In addition, some trials of interventions that may increase falls during the intervention period (exercise, medication review) only reported falls during the post‐intervention period.

For medication review in care facilities, there was a more even balance of individually‐ and cluster‐randomised trials; 58% of trials (62% of participants) were individually randomised. The estimates of effect from the trials were inconsistent within both the cluster‐ and individually‐randomised trials, thus the high inconsistency of findings between trials for this intervention cannot be explained by the type of randomisation used. Two cluster‐randomised trials contributed only 18% of the participants for the evidence for multifactorial interventions in care facilities, the estimates of effect in these two trials were similar to that for the pooled overall effect estimates. All trials of additional exercise in care facilities were individually randomised. In trials of bed exit alarms in hospitals, only two trials contributed to pooled data; 96% of participants were enrolled in one trial that was cluster randomised, thus consideration of the findings of trials that were individually in comparison with cluster randomised is uninformative.
