Training sessions enable staff to rehearse for these events and are recommended by several reports and guidelines. In this review we have focused on interactive training, this includes any element where the training is not solely didactic but provides opportunity for discussions, rehearsals, or interaction with faculty or technology. It is important to understand the effective methods and essential elements for successful emergency training so that resources can be appropriately targeted to improve outcomes. </p> </section> <section id="CD012177-sec-0002"> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0002">Objectives</h3> <p>To assess the effects of interactive training of healthcare providers on the management of life‐threatening emergencies in hospital on patient outcomes, clinical care practices, or organisational practices, and to identify essential components of effective interactive emergency training programmes. </p> </section> <section id="CD012177-sec-0003"> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0003">Search methods</h3> <p>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and ERIC and two trials registers up to 11 March 2019. We searched references of included studies, conference proceedings, and contacted study authors. </p> </section> <section id="CD012177-sec-0004"> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0004">Selection criteria</h3> <p>We included randomised trials and cluster‐randomised trials comparing interactive training for emergency situations with standard/no training. We defined emergency situations as those in which immediate lifesaving action is required, for example cardiac arrests and major haemorrhage. We included all studies where healthcare workers involved in providing direct clinical care were participants. We excluded studies outside of a hospital setting or where the intervention was not targeted at practicing healthcare workers. We included trials irrespective of publication status, date, and language. </p> </section> <section id="CD012177-sec-0005"> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0005">Data collection and analysis</h3> <p>We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each included trial. Due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity in outcome measures, we were unable to perform the planned meta‐analysis. We provide a structured synthesis for the following outcomes: survival to hospital discharge, morbidity rate, protocol or guideline adherence, patient outcomes, clinical practice outcomes, and organisation‐of‐care outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence and the strength of recommendations for each outcome. </p> </section> <section id="CD012177-sec-0006"> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0006">Main results</h3> <p>We included 11 studies that reported on 2000 healthcare providers and over 300,000 patients; one study did not report the number of participants. Seven were cluster randomised trials and four were single centre studies. Four studies focused on obstetric training, three on obstetric and neonatal care, two on neonatal training, one on trauma and one on general resuscitations. The studies were spread across high‐, middle‐ and low‐income settings. </p> <p>Interactive training may make little or no difference in survival to hospital discharge for patients requiring resuscitation (1 study; 30 participants; 98 events; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain if emergency training changes morbidity rate, as the certainty of the evidence is very low (3 studies; 1778 participants; 57,193 patients, when reported). We are uncertain if training alters healthcare providers' adherence to clinical protocols or guidelines, as the certainty of the evidence is very low (3 studies; 156 participants; 558 patients). We are uncertain if there were improvements in patient outcomes following interactive training for emergency situations, as we assessed the evidence as very low‐certainty (5 studies, 951 participants; 314,055 patients). We are uncertain if training for emergency situations improves clinical practice outcomes as the certainty of the evidence is very low (4 studies; 1417 participants; 28,676 patients, when reported). Two studies reported organisation‐of‐care outcomes, we are uncertain if interactive emergency training has any effect on this outcome as the certainty of the evidence is very low (634 participants; 179,400 patient population). </p> <p>We examined prespecified subgroups and found no clear commonalities in effect of multidisciplinary training, location of training, duration of the course, or duration of follow‐up. We also examined areas arising from the studies including focus of training, proportion of staff trained, leadership of intervention, and incentive/trigger to participate, and again identified no clear mediating factors. The sources of funding for the studies were governmental, local organisations, or philanthropic donors. </p> </section> <section id="CD012177-sec-0007"> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0007">Authors' conclusions</h3> <p>We are uncertain if there are any benefits of interactive training of healthcare providers on the management of life‐threatening emergencies in hospital as the certainty of the evidence is very low. We were unable to identify any factors that may have allowed us to identify an essential element of these interactive training courses. </p> <p>We found a lack of consistent reporting, which contributed to the inability to meta‐analyse across specialities. More trials are required to build the evidence base for the optimum way to prepare healthcare providers for rare life‐threatening emergency events. These trials need to be conducted with attention to outcomes important to patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers. It is vitally important to develop high‐quality studies adequately powered and with attention to minimising the risk of bias. </p> </section> </div> </section> <section class="pico-section" id="pico"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title">PICOs <i class="icon fa fa-info-circle" title="The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

There are many training courses for this, some of which allow healthcare workers to interact with learning materials and other workers. However, we do not know if these training courses prepare healthcare workers to provide better healthcare. </p> <p>We searched for studies that assessed the effectiveness of interactive training compared to usual training or no training. We looked only at the type of study thought to be the strongest form of evidence, that is randomised trials (where participants could be assigned to either the training group or no/standard‐training group by chance). We looked for any effects on patient outcomes (e.g. survival or length of hospital stay), any effects on staff (e.g. improved skills in an actual clinical situation), or changes within the organisation (e.g. reorganisation of working patterns). We did not look at changes in a simulated environment. </p> <p><b>What are the main results of this review?</b> </p> <p>We found 11 studies that were relevant to this review. Nine of these focused on maternal and newborn health. Because there were so few studies and they all examined different effects of emergency training, we were unable to combine the results. </p> <p>All of the trials included weaknesses in their design that could have lead to inaccurate results. The certainty of evidence for our important outcomes focusing on changes to patient care/outcomes was very low, therefore based on the available evidence we are uncertain as to whether training of healthcare workers in the management of life‐threatening emergency situations made a difference to patients or organisations. The studies were paid by government, local hospitals, or charities. </p> <p><b>How up‐to‐date is this review?</b> </p> <p>We looked at all of the studies examining this area up until March 2019.</p> </div> </section> <section id="vls" style="display: none"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title">Visual summary<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i></h2> </div> <a href="" target="_blank"><img alt="visual summary" src=""/></a> </section> <section class="conclusions"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD012177-sec-0119" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Authors' conclusions <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="authorsConclusions" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD012177-sec-0119"></div> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0120">Implications for practice</h3> <section id="CD012177-sec-0120"> <p>Logically, it seems important to train staff for in‐hospital‐based emergencies. However, due to the heterogeneity of outcomes within this review, it was not possible to provide firm conclusions as to whether interactive training works. Having said this, the structured synthesis of the evidence showed that most of the studies included in this review reported improvements in patient, staff, or organisational outcomes. The certainty of the evidence for these results is very low. </p> <p>The evidence for what type of training works and what the important elements of training are is unclear. However, we did find that the effects of interactive training were not universal in any given study. </p> </section> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0121">Implications for research</h3> <section id="CD012177-sec-0121"> <p>Whilst a wealth of studies have been carried out into emergency training, there are few well‐conducted randomised trials. Implementing training even when it is local and low‐cost represents a significant investment for a healthcare facility (<a href="./references#CD012177-bbs2-0065" title="YauCWH , PizzoE , MorrisS , OddDE , WinterC , DraycottT . The cost of local, multi‐professional obstetric emergencies training. Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica2016;95:1111‐1119. ">Yau 2016</a>), therefore in the resource‐stretched environment of health care it is vital that high‐quality studies are undertaken to identify whether interventions are effective or not. This is especially important as we have seen that not all training is effective, and in some cases there can be negative impact. </p> <p>Furthermore, it is important going forwards that studies are carefully designed to answer important clinical questions with outcomes that patients, staff, and policymakers value. For example, it is imperative that cost‐effectiveness of interventions be considered, due to the high cost of implementing training. In terms of patient outcome measures, although interim measurements of knowledge and performance in simulated environments are useful markers of the success of an intervention, it is vital that there is a shift towards measuring the harder‐to‐measure outcomes, such as clinical and organisational practice change, as the primary outcomes of studies. Powering studies to these outcomes will ensure that there is a clearer understanding of exactly how effective the interventions are, and which ones are most worthwhile investing in to improve patient care. However, we acknowledge this requires significant investment. </p> <p>It has become evident that a wealth of outcome measures are reported within each of these areas. When considering individual clinical areas (e.g. paediatrics, anaesthetics), there are still very different measures used. To enable both meta‐analysis and comparison between interventions, it is important that all studies should report a core outcome set. </p> <p>Whilst these studies do not necessarily need to be randomised trials, it is important that they are well conducted and answer valuable questions. </p> <p>Another point raised by this review is length of follow‐up. If, as we recommend, clinically important outcomes, rather than the more common intermediary measures, are the primary outcomes of these studies, either large sample sizes or long time periods will be necessary. Furthermore, the important issue of deterioration in effect over time needs to be addressed. As we have discussed, the idea of repeated training is important (<a href="./references#CD012177-bbs2-0028" title="BluestoneJ , JohnsonP , FullertonJ , CarrC , AldermanJ , BonTempoJ . Effective in‐service training design and delivery: evidence from an integrative literature review. Human Resources for Health2013;11:51. ">Bluestone 2013</a>), and as such it will be important to record the changes over time in the effectiveness of the interventions and have a sufficient follow‐up period to be able to measure the impact of time. We suggest that under one year is likely to be an insufficient length of follow‐up. </p> <p>There has also been a significant concentration in studies on obstetric and neonatal emergencies, with much less focus on the other medical and surgical specialities. It is important that there is more concentration outside of maternal and neonatal health in order to ensure that patient care in all settings is enhanced. </p> </section> </section> </section> <section class="summaryOfFindings"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD012177-sec-0043" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Summary of findings <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="summaryOfFindings" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD012177-sec-0043"></div> <div class="table" id="CD012177-tbl-0001"> <table class="summary-of-findings framed"><a class="open-table-viewer open-in-figure-viewer" href="#0">Open in table viewer</a><div class="table-heading"><span class="table-label">Summary of findings for the main comparison.</span> <span class="table-title">Interactive training for in‐hospital‐based healthcare providers on the management of life‐threatening emergencies: effects on clinical practice and patient outcomes</span></div> <tbody> <tr class="separated"> <td align="left" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>The effects of interactive training of healthcare providers on the management of life‐threatening emergencies in hospital</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr class="separated"> <td align="left" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>Patient or population:</b> </p> <p><i>Participants:</i> Healthcare workers delivering life‐saving emergency care in a hospital setting (obstetric/labour and delivery staff, physicians, skilled birth attendants, midwives, midlevel surgical trainees, anaesthesiologists, nurses, internal medical residents)<br/> <i>Population:</i> Patients who suffer life‐threatening emergencies in hospital: women around the time of birth, neonates, trauma patients, and adults undergoing resuscitation<br/> <b>Setting:</b> All hospital settings are included.

Simulation: improving patient outcomes. Seminars in Perinatology2013;37(3):151‐6.

Oxford English Dictionary. Online. Oxford University Press, 2014. ">OED 2014</a>). For the purposes of this review, an emergency situation will be one in which immediate lifesaving action is required. Examples include cardiac or respiratory arrest, failed intubation, major haemorrhage, shoulder dystocia during childbirth, severe sepsis, and tension pneumothorax. These situations can arise either in emergency settings, for example in the emergency department, or in elective settings where staff have to respond to a patient's evolving condition, for example a failed intubation in theatre. </p> <p>Training for emergencies is different to that for routine care. This is because for routine care, whether the training is interactive or didactic, it can be backed up by 'on the job' reinforcement. The ability to spend time refining skills outside a high‐pressure environment means that a training programme does not have to perform the function of fully preparing staff for a new situation. However, for emergency situations, it is crucial that professionals work efficiently, both individually and as a team, even if it is the first time they have encountered the clinical situation or worked together. This requirement for comprehensive preparation has led to the development of training interventions to address the clinical and human factors in the emergency response. </p> </section> <section id="CD012177-sec-0046"> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0046">Description of the intervention</h3> <p>This review examined interactive training interventions preparing healthcare professionals for emergency situations. We considered training for interventions performed within hospitals, as part of the clinical role of staff. We considered hospitals to be any facility‐based care setting that provides comprehensive secondary or tertiary clinical care, which included care delivered as a first point of contact in the emergency department. </p> <p>In this review we concentrated on hospital‐based emergencies as a subset of all emergency care. There are other settings in which staff are trained to respond to emergencies, either in office‐based care settings or in the community. However, these settings are very different to the hospital environment and present different challenges. Within hospital settings it is usually possible to call upon a broader team of people and specialists to appropriately respond to and comprehensively manage an emergency. The focus in the community or primary care setting may be on the immediate management and transfer to an appropriate facility. Because of these differing priorities, the interventions and measures of effectiveness are likely to be different, therefore it was important to consider these areas separately. </p> <p>This review focused on interactive training, that is any form of educational session that has an interactive component. Interactive training courses can have many different formats: courses could have, for example, pre‐course e‐learning components, case‐study discussions, or skills‐drills. There must be a component of attendees interacting with the course/faculty and not only passively absorbing information. This presents a challenge when attempting to define or subcategorise interactive training.

By having a pre‐rehearsed systematic approach to an emergency, staff may then feel more able to concentrate on the current clinical situation rather than panicking about how to approach the emergency. It is this element of rehearsal and planning for emergencies that the interactive elements of the various types of training provide that could be the key to ensuring an appropriate emergency response by each individual and the team as a whole.

However, this review is broad in scope for three reasons. Firstly, there is a paucity of high‐quality randomised studies investigating emergency training, so the number of studies to be examined will be increased with a cross‐speciality review. Secondly, similar methods of training are applied across a range of emergencies, for example life support courses use similar methods to teach and assess candidates. Finally, although there are differences between training programmes, key essential elements to ensure successful emergency training may be clearly illuminated by examining programmes across specialities. </p> <p>This review considered all interactive training interventions, both medical and surgical, to identify essential components for effective training common to all situations. It focused on patient and organisational outcomes, rather than on acquisition of knowledge or user rating of training. </p> <p>A huge number of training courses have been developed worldwide to provide healthcare workers with the skills they require to deal with emergencies. However, as was identified over a decade ago, these courses are often poorly described and even more infrequently studied (<a href="./references#CD012177-bbs2-0027" title="BlackRS , BrocklehurstP .

">Yau 2016</a>), therefore it is essential that resources are channeled to increase the effectiveness of staff training and to maximise positive outcomes for patients. </p> <p>The focus of this review was on changes in staff practice and patient outcomes rather than surrogate outcome measures of change demonstrated by training programmes. An example of a surrogate measure may include change in performance in 'mock code' scenarios (<a href="./references#CD012177-bbs2-0035" title="DonoghueAJ , DurbinDR , NadelFM , StryjewskiGR , KostSI , NadkarniVM .

This broad definition has been selected to try to bring together the evidence of effectiveness for the variety of different training opportunities offered to staff. It will also provide us the opportunity to compare and contrast between different lengths and intensities of intervention. For the purposes of this review, we considered interactive training to be any type of educational intervention with an interactive component as categorised by Freeth (<a href="./references#CD012177-bbs2-0042" title="FreethD , HammickM , KoppelI , ReevesS , BarrH .

These interventions could take place individually or in groups. The intervention could involve the training of a single professional group or a multiprofessional team. The intervention could be of any duration and frequency and could occur in any setting (e.g. within the clinical department, local simulation room, or regional, national, or international training centre). </p> </section> <section id="CD012177-sec-0055"> <h4 class="title">Types of outcome measures</h4> <p>We used Kirkpatrick's model of educational outcomes as modified and used by Freeth to develop a categorisation scheme for outcomes (<a href="./references#CD012177-bbs2-0042" title="FreethD , HammickM , KoppelI , ReevesS , BarrH . A critical review of evaluation of interprofessional education. Learning and Teaching Support Network. UK Centre for the Advancement of Interprofessional Education2002. ">Freeth 2002</a>). We only considered studies that examined level 3 (behavioural change) and level 4 (practice and patient outcomes) in this review. We did not include level 1 (participant reaction) and 2 (acquisition of knowledge and skills) as outcomes for the review because despite their usefulness and wide use of the Kirkpatrick model, there remains a lack evidence for a clear causal chain between level 1 and 4 (<a href="./references#CD012177-bbs2-0025" title="BatesR . A critical analysis of evaluation practice: the Kirkpatrick model and the principle of beneficence. Evaluation and Program Planning2004;27:341‐7. ">Bates 2004</a>), therefore the use of level 1 and 2 outcomes as a surrogate for level 3 and 4 outcomes cannot be assumed. In addition, because we were interested in identifying effects of training programmes on outcomes measured during or related to emergency clinical care, we excluded the level 2 surrogate outcomes of knowledge and skills measured on simulators or actual patients in training and non‐emergency settings. </p> <p>Patient outcomes included mortality and severe morbidity. In order to demonstrate changes in the management of the relatively rare events leading to these outcomes, studies would be required to have extremely large sample sizes. In response to this, proxy measures of patient outcome are often used in smaller‐scale studies, and included in larger studies.

">Gomez 2018</a>). </p> <p>One other area that could have affected the way the interactive training studies were implemented was the leadership for the intervention and the trigger for initiating the study. These studies were largely initiated by the researchers reporting them, who were seeking more evidence to understand whether interactive training can improve actual outcomes, which are identified here as being at level 3 or 4 of the Kirkpatrick scale. This was the case across all the studies reported in this review, rather than being unique to either the group showing change or not. </p> <p>Another factor we identified is that in order to fund these important studies which are generally large in scale or length, a significant commitment is required. Governments or government agencies or large philanthropic organisations funded all of the included studies. This perhaps links to the complexity and scale required to answer the patient and organisation‐of‐care focused outcomes. </p> <p>The fact that randomised trials have been used to demonstrate changes in clinically and organisationally important outcomes is a significant step forwards from the previous focus on observational studies. It is difficult to power studies to achieve this aim, not in the least because the events are relatively rare, thus large number of participants or long time periods can be required to see any impact. </p> </section> <section id="CD012177-sec-0115"> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0115">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</h3> <p>We identified a comprehensive set of randomised trials. To achieve this we employed an inclusive search strategy to identify all randomised trials, and retrieved the full‐text reports of any that we thought may be useful. Our main limitations in terms of completeness and applicability of the evidence lie with the evidence that is available and the inherent weaknesses within it. This is largely due to the complex nature of training interventions as well as the tendency to implement projects on a small scale rather than in a research setting. </p> <p>The evidence found is largely based in obstetrics and neonatology, with only two of the 11 studies being focused outside of these areas. This may be particularly important as, in the experience of the review team, obstetrics and neonatology can be far more isolated medical specialties than, for example, internal medicine or surgery. This is due to the highly specialised nature of the patients being treated, meaning that the teams are relatively small and close‐knit compared to the broader medical specialities. However, this also means that it has not been possible to gain a comprehensive insight into the lessons across a broader group of specialities, which was one of the objectives of this review. </p> <p>Due to the nature of the ways the included studies are reported, it has not been possible to ascertain exactly how many patients fed into the outcomes for this review. This is because the population studied could either be the staff group to whom training was offered, or the patient population of the department participating in the study. This contributes to the difficulty in deciding how far the review findings are generalisable. </p> <p>Despite having exclusively used randomised trial evidence, it has not been possible to combine results to give a pooled estimate for the effect size of training for a specific outcome. Even when studies were investigating the same area, the outcome measures being used were disparate. And even when measuring morbidity in obstetrics, for example, there are no universally defined criteria, therefore studies measure this same outcome differently, making combining results impossible. It was also not possible to ascertain some of the issues that are useful for understanding the implementation of the studies, such as what proportion of staff were trained and what triggered the intervention. This is in part due to a lack of uniform criteria for complex behavioural‐change interventions. </p> <p>Whilst all of the studies included in this review are randomised, there is a large body of evidence in this area that comes from non‐randomised studies, which provides additional information not included in this review. For example, a review of observational evidence found that technology‐enhanced training could improve patient outcomes, however the evidence for the improved pooled effect size of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.34‐0.66; P &lt; .001) was inconsistent and included studies reporting negative effects (<a href="./references#CD012177-bbs2-0032" title="CookDA , HatalaR , BrydgesR , ZendejasB , SzostekJH , WangAT , et al.

When the intervention described was considered to be substantially more than interactive training, the review team debated its inclusion, our concern being that the changes observed in the study needed to be due to the interactive training being assessed rather than any separate organisational changes. There were further debates around how immediate the emergency care needed to be in order to be included, as a vast array of emergency care exists. </p> </section> <section id="CD012177-sec-0118"> <h3 class="title" id="CD012177-sec-0118">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</h3> <p>Broadly, the findings of this review agree with those of other reviews, namely that there is little high‐quality randomised trial evidence to confirm that interactive training programmes effect patient or organisational outcomes. One review focused on technology‐enhanced simulation, incorporating randomised trial evidence and observational evidence. They concluded that technology‐enhanced simulation had a moderate effect on patient outcomes (<a href="./references#CD012177-bbs2-0032" title="CookDA , HatalaR , BrydgesR , ZendejasB , SzostekJH , WangAT , et al.

However, when looking at individual specialities, rather than across specialities, there is more convincing evidence that interactive training is effective. For example, a Cochrane Review investigating in‐service training for health professionals to improve care of seriously ill newborns and children in low‐income countries found that in‐service training improves health professionals' treatment of neonates (<a href="./references#CD012177-bbs2-0054" title="OpiyoN , EnglishM .
