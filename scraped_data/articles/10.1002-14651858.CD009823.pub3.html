Many demonstrate considerable resilience and strong coping skills but continue to be vulnerable to risks. To provide best chances for them in life, services are needed to reduce risks and prevent marginalisation from mainstream society. Thirteen studies have rigorously evaluated 19 interventions such as services to support street‐connected children and youth ‐ all in high‐income countries. Most have compared therapy‐based services versus usual shelter and drop‐in services, or versus other therapeutic/health interventions. We found mixed results among these studies but overall findings suggesting that participants receiving therapy and those provided usual services benefited to a similar level. Future research should consider the benefits of usual drop‐in and shelter services, most particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries, and should focus on street‐connected children and young people. None of the studies included participants comparable with street children in low‐income countries, who may be on the street primarily to earn a living, or as a result of war, migration or urbanisation. Overall we assessed the quality of the evidence included in this review as low/moderate. </p> </div> </section> <section id="vls" style="display: none"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title">Visual summary<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i></h2> </div> <a href="" target="_blank"><img alt="visual summary" src=""/></a> </section> <section class="conclusions"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD009823-sec-0099" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Authors' conclusions <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="authorsConclusions" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD009823-sec-0099"></div> <h3 class="title" id="CD009823-sec-0100">Implications for practice</h3> <section id="CD009823-sec-0100"> <p>This review did not identify studies that could be included from low‐ and middle‐income countries, which were the original focus of the review. Most included studies focused on secondary outcomes specified in our protocol that were associated with harm reduction in areas such as substance use. </p> <p>In most studies, outcomes were similar for intervention and control groups. Thus, decisions on preferred mode of practice must rest on other considerations, such as feasibility, economic effectiveness, service user preference, long‐term sustainability, and so forth. However, control interventions, including usual services, in the included studies described high levels of intervention quality. It is no surprise that positive effects for some outcomes were more pronounced for interventions targeting needs not covered by service as usual (e.g. involvement of families for young people residing in a runaway shelter). </p> <p>It is unclear to what extent the types of interventions included in this review are generally available to street‐connected populations in the relevant countries or localities, and how representative they are of the most common types of interventions offered by service providers. As most were delivered by relatively highly qualified professionals (e.g. counsellors, therapists), we may assume that they are not likely to be integrated into typical service provision. Although family‐oriented therapy appeared partially effective with certain newly homeless or runaway populations (<a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0008" title="MilburnNG , IribarrenFJ , RiceE , LightfootM , SolorioR , Rotheram‐BorusMJ , et al.

">Slesnick 2009 FFT</a>), referral to mainstream services may not be as effective as delivery of the intervention in collaboration with a service setting such as a shelter or drop‐in service. Cost and feasibility evaluations must take this into account. </p> <p>In many contexts, the finding that in most cases the therapeutic intervention did not produce better results than service as usual might assist planning and development of policy and service delivery. </p> </section> <h3 class="title" id="CD009823-sec-0101">Implications for research</h3> <section id="CD009823-sec-0101"> <p>Although most studies included in the review were grounded in a well‐defined theoretical framework, these studies were commonly the first of their kind to test a particular intervention or outcome measure in the context of street‐connected children and youth. In this respect, all studies reviewed provide valuable indicators for future research and demonstrate that some specialised interventions are both viable and, in some respects, effective when applied to certain subpopulations of street‐connected children and youth (especially runaways with connections to their families). However, many study designs appeared to be determined, above all, by theoretical literature on the particular type of intervention employed in response to a set of narrowly defined problems (e.g. substance abuse). In contrast, the findings of our review suggest that characteristics of the study population and other process factors may be more relevant for achieving positive outcomes than technical or theoretical underpinnings of an intervention. </p> <p>All included studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Across all socio‐economic and cultural contexts, more research that includes control groups not in receipt of services is needed, as is research focusing on street‐recruited as opposed to agency‐recruited populations. Further, we found no evidence that service as usual conditions had been robustly evaluated; therefore, a key recommendation for further research is that such services in all geographical locations should be evaluated in comparison with no active intervention. Additional process evaluation data, in particular as regards the nature of engagement or motivational strategies, would add considerably to understanding within the field. </p> <p>The nature of control conditions in future research needs to be adequately captured and reported. In addition, it may be useful to employ a research instrument that will provide adequate comparative data on participants' experiences of intervention and control conditions. </p> <p>Overall, on the basis of our findings, we encourage research that is more directly guided by characteristics and concerns of the research population in question, and that builds on findings from previous and ongoing research involving participation of street‐connected children and youth, including qualitative research literature. For example, more creative thinking is needed around the conceptualisation and measurement of relevant outcomes for interventions given to this study population. Researchers should also attempt to provide a clear theoretical and methodological rationale for the outcomes selected for measurement. If standard outcomes are measured, use of standardised tools comparable with those used in other studies would positively contribute to the accumulation of research evidence. </p> <p>With this heterogeneous study population, calculating the percent of participants who improved on a particular outcome, as opposed to the percent who deteriorated or remained unchanged, would seem a potentially useful way of analysing findings. Finally, more attention should be paid to analyses of potential demographic confounders and process factors, given the complex nature of psycho‐social interventions in varied contexts. Considerable gaps remain in our understanding of the relationship between contextual factors, interventions and outcomes. Logic models such as those developed in this review (<a href="#CD009823-fig-0001">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#CD009823-fig-0002">Figure 2</a>) and existing qualitative and quantitative research on street‐connected children and youth (e.g. <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0093" title="FergusonK . Implementing a social enterprise intervention with homeless, street‐living youths in Los Angeles. Social Work2007;52(2):103‐12.

American Behavioral Scientist2008;51(6):772‐88. ">Karabanow 2008</a>) could aid researchers in clarifying their conceptual frameworks in this regard. </p> <p>We strongly recommend resourcing of robust evaluations in LMICs to ensure that the evidence base in this area is representative. We also suggest that the Cochrane Public Health Review Group consider carefully their utility of further updates to this review until more evidence from LMICs is available for inclusion. </p> </section> </section> </section> <section class="summaryOfFindings"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD009823-sec-0022" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Summary of findings <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="summaryOfFindings" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD009823-sec-0022"></div> <div class="table" id="CD009823-tbl-0001"> <table class="summary-of-findings framed"><a class="open-table-viewer open-in-figure-viewer" href="#0">Open in table viewer</a><div class="table-heading"><span class="table-label">Summary of findings for the main comparison.</span><span class="table-title"></span></div> <tbody> <tr class="separated"> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p><b>Therapeutic intervention compared with service as usual for street‐connected children and young people</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr class="separated"> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p><b>Patient or population:</b> street‐connected children and young people </p> <p><b>Settings:</b> shelters and drop‐in centres </p> <p><b>Intervention:</b> various specific therapeutic types of interventions </p> <p><b>Comparison:</b> shelter/drop‐in service as usual </p> </td> </tr> <tr class="table-header separated"> <td align="" class="table-header" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>Outcome categories (summarised)</b> </p> </td> <td align="" class="table-tint table-highlight" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>Impact</b> </p> </td> <td align="" class="table-tint table-highlight" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>Number of<br/> studies (Note: studies for different outcomes overlap)</b> </p> </td> <td align="" class="table-header" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>Quality of the evidence<br/> (GRADE)</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr class="separated"> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Primary outcome ‐ reintegration</p> <p> <ul id="CD009823-list-0001"> <li> <p>Promote inclusion and reintegration</p> </li> <li> <p>Increase literacy and numeracy</p> </li> <li> <p>IIncrease access to education and employment</p> </li> </ul> </p> </td> <td align="" class="table-tint table-highlight" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Reintegration was not measured in any of the studies.

Further, few studies involved a control condition receiving no services, and some did not involve a service as usual condition, reducing comparability across studies.

So far, we have particularly identified gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, citizenship, legal status and age of street‐connected children and young people as relevant individual factors that may impact outcomes of interventions. Relevant contextual factors include the experience of sexual abuse, violence, addiction, low literacy, migration (including rural‐to‐urban), poverty and mechanisms of exclusion (such as negative community responses to children's migratory or refugee status, and labelling of individuals as ‘vagrants’, ‘illegal vendors’ or ‘truants’). </p> <p>It is also important to consider the nature of strategies for engaging young people at street level that, according to a wealth of qualitative literature drawing on ethnographic data and practitioner perspectives, form the basis of successful intervention programmes (<a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0090" title="EnnewJ .

Although a little dated, its principles remain valid in that primary aims of policies and actions aimed at reversing exclusionary processes should be to:  </p> <p> <ul id="CD009823-list-0002"> <li> <p>promote full and equal inclusion in social systems;</p> </li> <li> <p>provide universal access to living standards that are socially acceptable to all members of a society, including access to the same level and quality of health and educational services, safe water, sanitation and ‘decent work’, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO); </p> </li> <li> <p>respect and promote cultural diversity; and</p> </li> <li> <p>address unequal inclusion as well as situations of extreme exclusion (<a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0169" title="PopayJ , EscorelS , HernándezM , JohnstonH , MathiesonJ , RispelL , WHO SEKN (Social Exclusion Knowledge Network).

">WHO SEKN 2008</a>). </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p>We believe that the results of this systematic review are relevant to a large number of street‐connected children and young people worldwide. We examined interventions that enable children to live safe and healthy lives that promote their rights and support their pathways to adulthood. We highlighted gaps in the current evidence base. For the purposes of this review, we defined reintegration as entry of children and young people into a residential or educational environment that has the potential to provide them with elements of physical safety, medical care, nutrition, counselling, education, inclusion in social and economic opportunities and room for recreation and personal and spiritual growth that may impact positively on longer‐term life chances. Reintegration does not mean returning children to situations from which they may have escaped. Family reintegration is potentially a highly valuable outcome for many street‐connected children and young people. However, the effectiveness and the ethical implementation of interventions aimed at family reintegration are based on access to appropriate resources for assessment, support and follow‐up, in recognition of the potentially significant risks associated with processes of family reintegration (<a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0092" title="FeenyT .

">Thoburn 2009</a>). </p> <p>‘Harm reduction’ is an umbrella term that is used to describe interventions aimed at reducing harms associated with lifestyles of street‐connected children and young people, including, for example, those associated with early or risky sexual activity and substance use (<a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0159" title="UNICEF .

">UNICEF 2001b</a>). Expressed in general terms, these would include interventions aimed at street‐connected children and young people to protect and promote their welfare and well‐being while they are on the street, so that they can benefit from more focused reintegration approaches when it is appropriate and possible for them to do so. All long‐term recommendations that we found at the UNICEF evaluation database are structural. However, short term recommendations from UNICEF are based on principles of child protection that can be described as matching the harm‐reduction approach. This theory is open to interpretation but seems to be in line with the opinions of people working with street‐connected children and young people who were consulted by members of our team; protection may be a necessary stage on the path to reintegration, alongside development and participation. </p> <p>We identified through a scoping search few rigorous reviews on the effectiveness of interventions to support street‐connected children and young people.

Review authors rather than study authors calculated all change scores reported in the review (<a href="./appendices#CD009823-sec-0106">Appendix 2</a>). These figures should be interpreted with caution as they do not account for standard deviation or group size and the number of missing participants. </p> <p>Additionally, although most studies presented relevant outcome data for the same number of participants at each time point, including baseline (i.e. missing cases were excluded from the analyses), in some studies, numbers varied between time points. Our change scores do not account for these discrepancies. Nevertheless, we believe they give a reasonable indication of certain important effects not captured by comparisons of means and standard deviations at fixed follow‐up time points. In particular, they help to demonstrate that in many cases, the scores for both groups improved from baseline, which may appear as no difference between groups in a meta‐analysis of endpoint data, or indeed as a benefit for the control group. </p> <section id="CD009823-sec-0055"> <h5 class="title">Outcomes not included in meta‐analysis</h5> <p>Numerous outcomes reported in the included studies were not included in the meta‐analysis because of differences in types of measurements or time points or because we were unable to access the data; however, they are listed under outcomes in the Results section of this review and in <a href="./appendices#CD009823-sec-0109">Appendix 3</a>. When possible, we have added these outcomes to the narrative report of outcome data included in the review to enable better cross‐referencing of more synthesised results across studies. </p> </section> </section> <section id="CD009823-sec-0056"> <h4 class="title">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</h4> <p>We hoped to include subgroups for analysis by age, gender, location of studies, HICs and LMICs and intervention approaches, to inform logic models and the development of possible theories arising from the review. However, data were insufficient for this. </p> </section> <section id="CD009823-sec-0057"> <h4 class="title">Sensitivity analysis</h4> <p>We conducted sensitivity analyses at update stage to assess the impact on study results at update stage, given that none of these included an SAU condition. We conducted meta‐analyses in each case without each new study in turn to assess the impact of the lack of SAU on study results. Results of these analyses at update seemed to show benefit for the control group when the new (update stage) studies were added, and a smaller overall effect. One possible reason for this may have been that 'control' group numbers in these studies were split between the different intervention groups to avoid double‐counting of participants in the analyses, potentially explaining the reduced weight attributed to these studies in the meta‐analysis.

As for depression, effects were relatively small, possibly because of split numbers in the control intervention group. Effects were largest (but were not statistically significant) for studies with an SAU group, and favoured the intervention. Overall, effects for individual studies were mixed and inconsistent across time points. This may reflect participant drop‐out. Within change scores, studies showed a consistent reduction across time points and intervention types (including control groups), which may reflect an overall positive 'intervention effect' on mental health. Alternatively, this may reflect changes over time.

">Slesnick 2013/Guo 2014 MET</a>) appeared on average relatively strong for certain outcome items (mainly related to substance use), although these interventions did not outperform other interventions in all studies. Overall, findings of the review suggest that use of structured services in itself predicts positive change in a range of outcomes. Further, the service as usual (SAU) conditions included in this review may have been more effective than specialised interventions in certain outcome categories, for example, reduction of sexual risk behaviours and increased contact with family. However, because of methodological limitations discussed here, we draw this conclusion with caution. </p> <p>In our primary logic model (<a href="#CD009823-fig-0001">Figure 1</a>), we outlined the broad components that appear to contribute most to intervention success with street‐connected children and youth based on our review of the research literature, including qualitative research. Most of the interventions included in this review focused on behaviour change related to participants' current lifestyle or reduction in associated harms, or both. We did not evaluate longer‐term outcomes beyond narrowly defined problem areas, and we did not identify studies from low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) that could be included. </p> </section> <section id="CD009823-sec-0087"> <h4 class="title">Overview of studies</h4> <p>Most of the 13 included studies were comparisons of two different interventions ‐ a specialised, therapeutic intervention versus SAU (three studies did not detail comparison conditions, but research populations were recruited largely from shelters rather than from the street). In most cases, the comparison intervention could also be considered a co‐intervention because intervention participants were not excluded from taking part in SAU. At the review update, we added three studies (measuring eight interventions) to the analysis. All of the most recent studies compared interventions with one another, and we selected the briefest/most conventional intervention to represent the control condition. </p> <p>All specialised interventions were based on therapeutic models, including social, emotional, cognitive, behavioural and systemic orientations. Four interventions represented a multi‐component approach that also included liaison with external service providers (e.g. housing departments, legal bodies), and six were delivered within a peer or family group setting.

Not all of the included studies provided information on SAU characteristics. It is clear, however, that some of the usual services were provided at a high standard and, in light of the similarities in outcomes achieved, may have been comparable with many of the specialised therapeutic interventions evaluated (see <a href="http://#QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" target="_blank">Quality of the evidence</a> section). None of the included studies included long‐term residential settings as a control condition. </p> <p>Although study populations varied somewhat between studies and interventions were reasonably heterogeneous, selected outcomes were notably homogeneous across the included studies, falling primarily into the categories of substance abuse (drug or alcohol), individual psychological functioning, social functioning and sexual health behaviours. In contrast, outcome measures and, consequently, individual outcome items were considerably varied. Little information was available to permit interpretation of the clinical or subjective significance of results reported for the study population in question or the potential impact of differences between constructs on outcomes. </p> <p>In terms of the aims of the review, no studies explicitly targeted the primary outcomes defined in our protocol ‐ inclusion and reintegration. In summary, all included interventions were relevant mainly to our secondary outcomes, although only a small proportion of the elements covered in our secondary outcomes or logic models were covered by any of the included interventions. In contrast, comparison interventions, that is, SAU, often appeared broader in scope. </p> <p>Secondary outcomes for which data were included in the meta‐analysis included safer or reduced sexual activity; safer or reduced substance use; self esteem; depression; reduced use of violence; and increased contact with family. We presented data from one study on increased use of hostel‐ or shelter‐type services. No data were available for literacy; numeracy; participation in education; participation in skills‐based (rather than exploitative) employment; or participation in intervention planning and delivery. Other outcomes measured in the included studies fell into the categories of social functioning, psychological functioning and family functioning. No studies reported on adverse outcomes. </p> <p>Only a limited number of studies could be included in meta‐analyses because of the extreme heterogeneity of outcome measures and time points used. To complement the meta‐analyses, we calculated change scores for all outcome items for which we had raw data (see <a href="./appendices#CD009823-sec-0106">Appendix 2</a>), primarily to highlight the fact that in many cases intervention effects appeared to be paralleled by positive changes of similar scale in the control group. Instances in which the control group showed greater improvement than the intervention group, or improved in opposition to a deteriorating trend in the intervention group, were rarely highlighted by study authors. We wished to draw attention to such instances, as they may provide some evidence of the comparative strengths of the SAU condition. However, because of the nature of the data available to us, we could not calculate standard deviations or standard errors for change scores. We therefore refer to them as indications only. </p> <p>Even in cases in which some statistically significant effects were indicated through meta‐analyses (or when change scores suggested statistically or clinically significant changes), most interventions achieved mixed results in relation to different outcome categories or items and different time points.

">Slesnick 2013/Guo 2014 MET</a>), benefits achieved in the intervention and control groups appeared in some cases substantial and relatively long‐lasting (12 to 24 months). Data from comparable studies (e.g. suite of studies by Slesnik teams) included at update reinforce this pattern. These studies did not include SAU but showed little difference between longer‐ and shorter‐term intervention groups. </p> <p>As a result of the limitations of the study designs employed, generic maturational effects underlying positive trends cannot be ruled out. As noted in one study, substance use patterns are characterised more often by change than by stability, and 'there appear to be natural developmental processes toward moderation of use' (Baer et al 1998, cited in <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0011" title="PetersonPL , BaerJS , WellsEA , GinzlerJA , GarrettSB . Short‐term effects of a brief motivational intervention to reduce alcohol and drug risk among homeless adolescents. Psychology of Addictive Behaviors2006;20(3):254‐64. ">Peterson 2006</a>, p 261). Longitudinal data on homeless young people living on the street in the United States offer some support for this trend (<a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0168" title="WhitbeckLB . Mental Health and Emerging Adulthood among Homeless People. New York: Psychology Press, 2009. ">Whitbeck 2009</a>, Chapter 15). However, the latter authors also argue that on the level of individual diagnoses, longitudinal data demonstrate long‐term stability across a range of mental health indicators including diagnoses for substance abuse, as well as continued social marginalisation. Findings support the notion of complementing overall analyses with individual‐level analyses, as discussed below in the section on <a href="http://#QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" target="_blank">Quality of the evidence</a> (statistical analyses). </p> <p>In our analyses, some of the most consistent improvements (in intervention and control groups) in substance abuse outcomes took place among participants residing at runaway shelters. Runaways are a distinct subpopulation of street‐connected children and youth who may never have lived on the street (Robertson and Toro 1999, cited in <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0015" title="SlesnickN , KangMJ .

Thus, they are likely to have relatively stronger family ties and limited engagement with street life. Participant scores on a range of risk measures (e.g. HIV risk behaviours, sexual activity, family violence) were usually relatively low on average in the included studies. However, even with these populations, results were mixed on the level of individual outcome items, as discussed below. Overall, we have limited knowledge of the process factors contributing to positive outcomes. </p> </section> <section id="CD009823-sec-0088"> <h4 class="title">Outcome findings</h4> <p>Our meta‐analyses showed statistically significant changes in either direction for five outcome items.

Each analysis relates to secondary outcome measures in a small number of studies (among these analyses, the greatest number of interventions was included for 'delinquent behaviours at three months', which also shows the smallest effect). Overall, these findings appear mixed and inconsistent. No data at update stage changed the significance of the original findings. </p> <p>As noted above, a limitation of our primary analyses is that we were unable to include in the meta‐analysis a large quantity of relevant data because investigators used different measurement types and time points. Therefore, for the evaluation summary below, we also draw on change scores (<a href="./appendices#CD009823-sec-0106">Appendix 2</a>) and authors' own analyses. </p> <section id="CD009823-sec-0089"> <h5 class="title">Safer or reduced sexual activity</h5> <p>Outcome measures and findings in this category were very mixed, with limited to no statistically significant or consistent intervention effects apparent.

">Lavis 2009</a>, in discussing applicability, highlights differences in service delivery contexts as of crucial importance for considering generalisability. As noted here, SAU and therapeutic interventions in several included studies incorporate specialist referrals and multi‐agency approaches. An important recent UN report (<a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0157" title="Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Protection and/or promotion of the rights of children living and working on the street. http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Children/Study/OHCHRBrochureStreetChildren.pdf (accessed 20 September 2012). ">UN High Commission on Human Rights 2012</a>) on street children recommends to governments many structural factors that might help to promote the rights of street children. Among these are co‐ordinated child protection and welfare systems; consistent birth registration; multi‐agency working partnerships; adequate financial provision for structures, services and co‐ordination; and ways to addressing stigma and discrimination among street children. Clearly, contexts in which such structures currently exist differ in many ways from contexts in which they do not. Many non‐government organisation (NGO) street children interventions in LMICs currently incorporate interventions similar to the SAU services offered in the included studies, but caution should be exercised when applying the results of this review to contexts that lack protective structural arrangements, and generalisability should be assessed on a context‐by‐context basis. </p> <p>Provision of a drop‐in or shelter service is perhaps the most typical form of intervention available for this population in both HICs and LMICs, and is the SAU received by comparison groups in the included studies. Such services commonly provide for basic physical and psychological needs, and sometimes facilitate access to specialist services. However, none of the included studies explicitly set out to examine the effectiveness of such services in themselves. Instead, they focused on highly specialised, time‐limited interventions drawing on psychological therapies, which inevitably have higher costs and may not be typical of service provision in HICs or LMICs, although they are arguably more readily available for street‐connected populations in the former group. Other interventions available in both HICs and LMICs include longer‐term residential settings for street‐connected children and youth. Such services were not represented in the included studies. </p> <p>The highly specialised therapeutic interventions examined in the included studies are not typical of interventions offered in HICs or in LMICs to support street‐connected children and young people while promoting reintegration‐type outcomes. SAU comparison interventions are more similar to services offered across the world. The overall finding that in many cases SAU participants improved from baseline on the measures used supports the use of these interventions, although a 'measurement effect' whereby repeated assessments conducted during the studies may in themselves trigger greater awareness and contribute to the outcomes obtained cannot be ruled out (<a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0098" title="GodinG , SheeranP , ConnerM , GermainM .

This suggests that although poverty is a significant trigger for children’s migration to the street in LICs, it is also likely that these children are working but returning home. On the other hand, children who leave as a result of abuse or family disintegration tend to live on the street and do not return home. However, other researchers have considered such categorisations overly rigid in the light of complex and shifting circumstances characteristic of the lives of street‐connected children and young people (<a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0091" title="EnnewJ , Swart‐KrugerJ .

">Conticini 2007</a> reports their main finding that the breakdown of social relationships within the household, not economic poverty, is the primary cause of child migration to the street (p 207), and this is supported by the other studies in LICs cited here. Thus the similarities between HICs and LICs appear strong in relation to family dysfunction as a causal factor for children and young people leaving home. Studies in HICs do not postulate that poverty is a prominent factor in youth homelessness, and the scope for research into specific links between economic hardship within families and the economic activities of homeless youth is clear. However, the common ground that is emerging for HICs and LICs does appear to lie within the sphere of family fragility and dysfunction as a trigger into homelessness and street life. </p> <p>For street‐connected children and young people from LMICs whose reasons for being on the street include earning a living or contributing to family income, the intervention approach may need to be different, allowing for both ongoing economic support and skills training and education such as that offered by some NGOs, for example, conditional cash transfer schemes, as well as other support. Income deprivation may not be the usual focus for interventions in HICs but clearly has relevance in the context of insecure labour markets, growing (youth) unemployment and reduced welfare funding, which affect children and youth in HICs worldwide (see, for example, <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0106" title="KarabanowJ , HughesJ , TicknoeJ , KiddS , PattersonD .

Similarly, for children and young people who are on the streets for reasons of war, urbanisation or migration, particularly but not exclusively in LMIC contexts (see, for example, <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0077" title="AltanisP , GoddardJ .

This differs from many developing world spaces where children are on the streets with their families, working and living together.

Similarly, family‐focused interventions might specifically be less popular in some cultural contexts for the inverse of these reasons. Depending on the levels of stigma associated with substance use and sexual behaviour in some cultural contexts, assessments would have to be performed to determine whether interventions that were focused on these behaviours in particular might be more or less acceptable and appropriate. For example, family conflict involving social exclusion or stigmatisation of individuals with minority sexual identities may be better tackled at the community level.

Thus, no study in this review compared an intervention versus 'nothing' or 'no service', which is the condition lived by most street‐connected children and young people around the world.

Many commentators believe that it would be unethical to offer no service to vulnerable populations. This ethical stance may account for the absence of no treatment control groups. </p> <p>Most studies provided limited information for assessment of control conditions. Thus, significant variance in the quality and quantity of services offered by different types of agencies in SAU conditions was suggested, the data provided were not sufficient for robust comparisons across interventions.

">Rew 2007</a>, who recruited participants from mixed settings, including streets, did not specify the control condition. </p> <p>In many cases, however, SAU appeared to be of relatively high quality. For instance, the drop‐in centre that served as the SAU condition in <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0006" title="CauceAM , MorganCJ , WagnerV , MooreE , SyJ , WurzbacherK , et al. Effectiveness of intensive case management for homeless adolescents: results of a 3‐month follow‐up. Journal of Emotional and Behavioural Disorders1994;2(4):219‐27. ">Cauce 1994</a> offered street‐involved youth "a drop‐in room, free meals, food and clothing banks, health services, a school program, and recreation programs" (p 22). Additionally, the centre offered drug and alcohol counselling and group sessions on self esteem, sexuality, parenting and job skills, as well as individual case management. Several of the SAU conditions provided counselling services. Given the fact that interventions were usually narrow in scope, participants in the intervention groups were likely to access SAU to meet other needs. However, few of the included studies reported that investigators systematically controlled for similarity between the two groups in terms of using 'control' services, apart from limited data in some studies (e.g. number of counselling sessions). Furthermore, it is impossible to know to what extent positive outcomes in the intervention group were contingent upon simultaneous receipt of SAU. At update, motivational enhancement therapy (MET) was assessed as sufficiently similar to SAU conditions in the original studies to be included as comparable, given that SAU is also an active intervention. </p> <p>Furthermore, in so far as many interventions were time‐limited and specialised, as opposed to more permanent and comprehensive services, which may have been more familiar to the research population, it could be argued that control conditions may have offered distinct advantages vis‐à‐vis intervention conditions. However, service delivery‐related confounders (e.g. service satisfaction, level of engagement) usually were examined only in the context of the intervention condition. A further potentially confounding factor in some studies was the fact that, as in the case of several interventions, some agency‐based services were contained within their location, but others involved referrals or joined‐up working with external service providers, depending on individual needs. The impact of external services was not examined in any relevant studies. </p> <p>Finally, as interventions commonly took place in the shelter or drop‐in centre from which participants were recruited, a high likelihood of contamination between intervention and control groups was noted in most studies. Several study authors drew attention to this fact. Participants in intervention and control groups were likely to belong to the same peer network and therefore could affect each other's behaviours in either direction. In summary, it is very difficult to isolate intervention effects from effects of SAU, especially in studies in which the two conditions operated under the same roof.

Thus, consistency is lacking in the choice of outcomes across studies. </p> <p>Irrespective of theoretical orientation, appropriate relevant measurable effects of an intervention are not obvious. In addition, the line between outcomes and process factors is blurred. For example, although several interventions included a motivational element, defined as encouraging ‘readiness to change’ (<a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0011" title="PetersonPL , BaerJS , WellsEA , GinzlerJA , GarrettSB . Short‐term effects of a brief motivational intervention to reduce alcohol and drug risk among homeless adolescents. Psychology of Addictive Behaviors2006;20(3):254‐64.

Short‐term effects of a brief motivational intervention to reduce alcohol and drug risk among homeless adolescents. Psychology of Addictive Behaviors2006;20(3):254‐64. ">Peterson 2006</a> measured ‘stage of change’ only at baseline.

These appear to be target elements of interventions included in the review but were not treated as outcomes.

">Slesnick 2007/08</a>, define concrete behavioural targets, such as an increase in positive (as opposed to risk‐inducing) social activities and peer relationships, which were not translated into outcomes apart from the aggregate measure of 'social stability'. Few studies measured factors specific to street‐connected populations and highlighted by both ethnographic (e.g. <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0105" title="KarabanowJ . Getting off the street: exploring the processes of young people's street exits. American Behavioral Scientist2008;51(6):772‐88. ">Karabanow 2008</a>) and quantitative or mixed methods studies (e.g. <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0168" title="WhitbeckLB . Mental Health and Emerging Adulthood among Homeless People. New York: Psychology Press, 2009. ">Whitbeck 2009</a>) as crucial for exit from street life. </p> <p>We can infer that many of these potential ‘process factors’ were nevertheless relevant to most interventions, as well as to SAU. Although they may be considered moderating or mediating factors in relation to concrete outcomes such as reduced substance use, they do not appear to differ in a fundamental sense from constructs such as self esteem. Furthermore, to evaluate intervention effectiveness, it might be considered important to measure whether the intervention appeared valid as a method used with a particular research population (e.g. whether a motivational intervention in fact increased motivation). One of the challenges of evaluating the effectiveness of psycho‐social interventions derives from the fact that they typically consist of multiple treatment components, which are difficult to quantify. Meta‐analyses of common psychological therapies have shown that common process factors, especially therapeutic relationship variables, may account for 30% of the variance in treatment outcomes for adults, above and beyond the 15% of variance accounted for by therapeutic techniques (Lambert and Barley 2002, cited in <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0108" title="KarverMS , HandelsmanJ , FieldsS , BickmanL . Meta‐analysis of therapeutic relationship variables in youth and family therapy: the evidence for different relationship variables in the child and adolescent treatment outcome literature. Clinical Psychology Review2006;26:50‐65. ">Karver 2006</a>). None of the included studies controlled for treatment variables such as quality of the therapeutic relationship or group cohesion. </p> <p>Viewing outcomes in a narrow context or in isolation from each other, without locating them in the real, everyday experiences of study participants, may lead to misleading conclusions. For example, <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0036" title="FergusonKM , XieB . Feasibility study of the social enterprise intervention with homeless youth. Research on Social Work Practice2008;18(1):5‐19. ">Ferguson 2008</a> found an increased number of sexual partners among youth taking part in a social enterprise intervention, in marked contrast to a (non‐randomised) control group from the same drop‐in centre that significantly reduced numbers of sexual partners over the same period. Some of their qualitative data suggest that this fact could be explained by increased self confidence among intervention participants, which by itself may be considered a desired outcome. Similarly, a cross‐sectional study by <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0024" title="BoothRE , ZhangY , KwiatkowskiCF . The challenge of changing drug and sex risk behaviors of runaway and homeless adolescents. Child Abuse and Neglect1999;23(12):1295‐306.

However, contradictory outcome findings were explored to a limited extent. </p> <p>In summary, although these studies covered important outcomes, predefined outcomes often directly transposed from research with very different study populations, usually with limited relevance to a particular intervention, may not adequately reflect the full range of risks that street‐connected children and youth are likely to encounter. Conversely, important intervention benefits may go undocumented. More work is required to develop appropriate research tools for this area of research, ideally drawing on both bottom‐up participatory methods (as exemplified, for example, in <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0094" title="FergusonKM , IslamN . Conceptualizing outcomes with street‐living young adults: grounded theory approach to evaluating the Social Enterprise Intervention. Qualitative Social Work2008;7(2):217‐37. ">Ferguson 2008b</a>) and broader theories of change. </p> <p>As depicted above, despite overall homogeneity of measured outcomes, the measurement tools and, consequently, the outcome components reported in these studies were highly heterogeneous. Most of the measures used were validated, and data on their reliability were made available in study publications. However, measures were not commonly validated in the context of studying homeless or street‐connected young people. The measurement tools employed were typically self report for practical and ethical reasons. Potential biases inherent in self report measures are well known and were highlighted by several study authors. For example, under‐reporting and over‐reporting may occur as the result of social desirability or trust issues. This fact is compounded by potential problems of recall. For instance, it could have been challenging for some youth to calculate and report the numbers of times they 'used alcohol' or 'had sex' in the past three months (Milburn 2012 [pers comm]) in part because their chaotic lives are marked by high rates of substance abuse, which may impact negatively on accurate recall (e.g. <a href="./references#CD009823-bbs2-0012" title="RewL , FouladiRT , LandL , WongYJ .

For the purposes of this review, at update, in each of these studies, the intervention deemed by review authors closest to SAU conditions in the original studies was selected as the comparator. It was agreed with the Cochrane Editorial Unit that it is reasonable to consider these studies comparable, given that SAU is also an intervention, but that the possible source of bias should be highlighted, In consideration of this, sensitivity analyses were performed with all new studies to assess the impact of the absence of SAU and the comparison between several interventions on study results. Results of the sensitivity analysis at update seemed to show benefit for the control group when new studies were included, along with a smaller overall effect.

Quality of evidence for all available outcome categories was upgraded because they were based on robust study designs (RCTs); reasonably low drop‐out rates (for the study population involved); some analysis of major confounders including age and gender, and publication of data for a broad range of outcomes, including non‐significant outcomes, measured over reasonably long follow‐up periods, in most included studies. Quality of evidence was downgraded for the following reasons: heterogeneity of study outcomes, measures and types of statistical analysis used; inconsistency in measures, findings and analyses across outcomes and across studies with similar interventions; reliance on self report; use of convenience samples; over‐representation of studies from one study team; and questions over study generalisability. Further, few studies involved a control condition receiving no services, and some did not involve a service as usual condition, reducing comparability across studies. Finally, the relationship between intervention theories and outcomes measured remained unclear, and clinical and subjective significance of outcomes was explored in a small number of included studies. No participatory or process evaluations were available </p> <p><sup>b</sup>As above, but the quality of the evidence was further downgraded because of the relatively small number of heterogeneous studies </p> <p><sup>c</sup>As above, but the quality of the evidence was further downgraded because of the small number of studies available.
