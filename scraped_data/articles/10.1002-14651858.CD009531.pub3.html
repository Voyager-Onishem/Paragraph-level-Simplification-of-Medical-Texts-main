Collaborative care interventions aim to improve the physical and/or mental health care of individuals with SMI. This is an update of a 2013 Cochrane review, based on new searches of the literature, which includes an additional seven studies. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0002"> <h3 class="title" id="CD009531-sec-0002">Objectives</h3> <p>To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care approaches in comparison with standard care (or other non‐collaborative care interventions) for people with diagnoses of SMI who are living in the community. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0003"> <h3 class="title" id="CD009531-sec-0003">Search methods</h3> <p>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Study‐Based Register of Trials (10 February 2021). We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders (CCMD) controlled trials register (all available years to 6 June 2016). Subsequent searches on Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO together with the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (with an overlap) were run on 17 December 2021. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0004"> <h3 class="title" id="CD009531-sec-0004">Selection criteria</h3> <p>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where interventions described as 'collaborative care' were compared with 'standard care' for adults (18+ years) living in the community with a diagnosis of SMI. SMI was defined as schizophrenia, other types of schizophrenia‐like psychosis or bipolar affective disorder. The primary outcomes of interest were: quality of life, mental state and psychiatric admissions at 12 months follow‐up. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0005"> <h3 class="title" id="CD009531-sec-0005">Data collection and analysis</h3> <p>Pairs of authors independently extracted data. We assessed the quality and certainty of the evidence using RoB 2 (for the primary outcomes) and GRADE. We compared treatment effects between collaborative care and standard care. We divided outcomes into short‐term (up to six months), medium‐term (seven to 12 months) and long‐term (over 12 months). </p> <p>For dichotomous data we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and for continuous data we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used random‐effects meta‐analyses due to substantial levels of heterogeneity across trials. We created a summary of findings table using GRADEpro. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0006"> <h3 class="title" id="CD009531-sec-0006">Main results</h3> <p>Eight RCTs (1165 participants) are included in this review. Two met the criteria for type A collaborative care (intervention comprised of the four core components). The remaining six met the criteria for type B (described as collaborative care by the trialists, but not comprised of the four core components). The composition and purpose of the interventions varied across studies. For most outcomes there was low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence<i>.</i> </p> <p>We found three studies that assessed the quality of life of participants at 12 months. Quality of life was measured using the SF‐12 and the WHOQOL‐BREF and the mean endpoint mental health component scores were reported at 12 months. Very low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference in quality of life (mental health domain) between collaborative care and standard care in the medium term (at 12 months) (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.26 to 0.32; 3 RCTs, 227 participants). Very low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference in quality of life (physical health domain) between collaborative care and standard care in the medium term (at 12 months) (SMD 0.08, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.33; 3 RCTs, 237 participants). </p> <p>Furthermore, in the medium term (at 12 months) low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference between collaborative care and standard care in mental state (binary) (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.28; 1 RCT, 253 participants) or in the risk of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital at 12 months (RR 5.15, 95% CI 0.67 to 39.57; 1 RCT, 253 participants). </p> <p>One study indicated an improvement in disability (proxy for social functioning) at 12 months in the collaborative care arm compared to usual care (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.95; 1 RCT, 253 participants); we deemed this low‐certainty evidence. </p> <p>Personal recovery and satisfaction/experience of care outcomes were not reported in any of the included studies. The data from one study indicated that the collaborative care treatment was more expensive than standard care (mean difference (MD) international dollars (Int$) 493.00, 95% CI 345.41 to 640.59) in the short term. Another study found the collaborative care intervention to be slightly less expensive at three years. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0007"> <h3 class="title" id="CD009531-sec-0007">Authors' conclusions</h3> <p>This review does not provide evidence to indicate that collaborative care is more effective than standard care in the medium term (at 12 months) in relation to our primary outcomes (quality of life, mental state and psychiatric admissions). The evidence would be improved by better reporting, higher‐quality RCTs and the assessment of underlying mechanisms of collaborative care.

Furthermore, the majority of evidence was either low‐ or very low‐certainty. </p> <p><b>What is severe mental illness?</b> </p> <p>Severe mental illness (SMI) refers to people with psychological problems that can be challenging to a level that impacts on their ability to engage in everyday activities. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and non‐organic psychosis are all examples of SMIs. </p> <p><b>What did we want to find out?</b> </p> <p>The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of collaborative care in comparison to standard or usual care. </p> <p><b>What is collaborative care?</b> </p> <p>Collaborative care aims to improve both the physical and mental health of people living with long‐term conditions. All definitions agree that it seeks to develop closer working relationships and better communication between primary care (general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses) and specialist health care (such as Community Mental Health Teams, including psychiatrists and psychologists). There are different ways in which this can be achieved, making collaborative care complex. Greater joined‐up working between services is expected to provide someone with a severe mental illness (SMI) with better care, based in the community, which is often a less stigmatised and stigmatising setting than hospital. It is also important because about 31% of people with SMI living in the UK are seen only in a primary care setting. </p> <p><b>What did we do?</b> </p> <p>Electronic databases were searched in 2020 and 2021 for trials of collaborative care. The primary outcomes of interest were quality of life, mental health and admissions to hospital. We included eight studies in this review. This is an update of the original review published in 2013, which included only one study. This version is based on new searches of the literature that identified an additional seven studies. </p> <p><b>What did we find?</b> </p> <p>No differences were shown in quality of life, mental state or admissions to a psychiatric hospital at 12 months. One study showed an improvement in disability at 12 months. Disability was used as an indirect measure of how well people function in their lives, in terms of their social roles and activities. </p> <p>Although personal recovery and experience of care/satisfaction were outcomes that those with ongoing mental health problems highlighted as important, none of the included studies measured these. </p> <p><b>What are the limitations of the evidence?</b> </p> <p>Our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. Most of the studies included did not meet a strict definition of collaborative care (what we called type A collaborative care) and there were large variations in the interventions delivered. Furthermore, the majority of evidence was either low‐ or very low‐certainty. Further research is needed to determine whether collaborative care is good for people with a diagnosis of severe mental illness in terms of clinical outcomes or helping people feel better, as well as its cost‐effectiveness. Further high‐quality RCTs with a clear focus on assessing outcomes directly related to collaborative care are needed in this area, which may also benefit from mixed‐methods and qualitative research to understand how collaborative care can best be delivered. None of the studies measured adverse effects of collaborative care. </p> <p>The original plain language summary was written by Ben Gray and adapted by John Gibson for the updated review.

We found the certainty of evidence to be low. In contrast, collaborative care may slightly increase psychiatric admissions in the medium term (up to 12 months) and non‐psychiatric admissions in the medium term (two years), but these were not statistically significant results, and it was not clear if this outcome also included psychiatric admissions. It is possible that collaborative care may contribute to greater admissions in particular healthcare settings because individuals may be more closely monitored or because the intervention may actively facilitate admissions when needed. </p> <p>There were no data available regarding the effect of collaborative care on personal recovery. </p> <p>For patients with schizophrenia<i>,</i> there is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether collaborative care approaches improve mental health outcomes. </p> <p>Assessment of the certainty of evidence suggests that caution should be applied in using the results of this review if choosing collaborative care to improve quality of life, mental state or short‐term psychiatric admissions for people with a diagnosis of severe mental illness. </p> <section id="CD009531-sec-0282"> <h5 class="title">Implications for policy</h5> <p>Healthcare policy in the UK recommends that primary care and specialist services integrate care more effectively (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0225" title="Schizophrenia: core interventions in the treatment and management of schizophrenia in adults in primary and secondary care (CG82).

In collaborative care models tested in these settings, primary care providers serve in a liaison role that is analogous to the role of specialty mental health providers in primary care‐based collaborative care models.

Collaborative care utilises a multi‐professional approach to care, including care provided by both a primary physician and a senior mental health professional, a structured management plan, scheduled follow‐ups and interprofessional communication. Case management involves a health worker taking responsibility for follow‐up care to assess patient adherence to treatment, monitor progress and take action when treatments are unsuccessful.

Others have reviewed the impact of collaborative care on depression and co‐morbid chronic physical illnesses (e.g. <a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0165" title="EkersD , MurphyR , ArcherJ , EbenezerC , KempD , GilbodyS .

If policy‐makers had even a fraction of this amount of evidence for people with severe mental illness, it is likely that it would be easier to draw clearer conclusions. Specifically, evidence from other collaborative care studies of depression, where improving outcomes for co‐morbid physical health problems has been targeted, might be extrapolated to develop interventions for people with SMI, as <a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0196" title="KatonWJ , LinEHB , Von KorffM , CiechanowskiP , LudmanEJ , YoungB , et al.

More of the same research with the same populations is not likely to substantially improve the evidence base around collaborative care. However, considering the literature identified by this review, we see clear opportunities to improve the evidence base, including: enhancing the quality of trial methodology and reporting, using the term 'collaborative care' consistently around an agreed definition, measuring consistent outcomes and those that matter most to people with SMI, and better understanding which people are most likely to benefit. </p> <section id="CD009531-sec-0284"> <h5 class="title">1. Enhancing the quality of trial methodology and reporting</h5> <p>Well‐designed, conducted and reported RCTs are required to determine the effectiveness of collaborative care for people with serious mental illness diagnoses. A comprehensive process evaluation should be a part of the design of complex intervention trials in this area and would assist with the interpretation of trial outcomes, as would a description of the contents of the intervention, and an explanation of how and why the intervention might work (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0155" title="CraigP , DieppeP , MacintyreS , MichieS , NazarethI , PetticrewM . Developing and evaluating complex interventions: the new Medical Research Council guidance. British Medical Journal2008;337:a1655. [DOI: 10.1136/bmj.a1655]">Craig 2008</a>). Study and intervention manuals should be made available and we also recommend that authors complete a TiDIER checklist (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0190" title="HoffmannTC , GlasziouPP , BoutronI , MilneR , PereraR , MoherD , et al.

[DOI: 10.1136/bmj.g1687]">Hoffman 2014</a>), providing important detail on the characteristics of the intervention and assessment of fidelity. </p> <p>Most services, for example community mental health teams in the UK, are organised to provide care to people living with a severe mental illness, rather than delivering condition‐specific models of care. Therefore, trials of collaborative care that include participants with any type of SMI are needed, as opposed to those directed at those with a single condition. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0285"> <h5 class="title">2. Terminology</h5> <p>Terms such as 'collaborative care', 'shared care' and 'integrated care' are used interchangeably to describe different levels of integration between service providers providing health care across a variety of settings. More precise nomenclature would make it easier to identify relevant studies, but until that time, future reviews could seek to identify studies that evaluated interventions that were not described as collaborative care but are comprised of the following four components (as per <a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0179" title="GunnJ , DiggensJ , HegartyK , BlashkiG .

Choice and reporting of outcome measures</h5> <p>Trial authors should consult relevant core outcome sets (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0270" title="WilliamsonPR , AltmanDG , BagleyH , BarnesKL , BlazebyJM , BrookesST , et al. The COMET Handbook: version 1.0. Trials2017;18(3):280.">Williamson 2017</a>) before deciding on their outcomes of interest. We are only aware of one relevant core outcome set (for those with bipolar; <a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0237" title="RetzerA , SayersR , PinfoldV , GibsonJ , KeeleyT , TaylorG , et al. Development of a core outcome set for use in community-based bipolar trials - a qualitative study and modified Delphi. PLOS One2020;15(10):e0240518.">Retzer 2020</a>); we consulted this when finalising our revised outcomes. Trial authors should consider carefully which outcomes their intervention is likely to affect and why. They should publish their prespecified outcomes in a study protocol prior to the reporting of results; this will enable any subsequent reviews of the literature to include an assessment of the likelihood of selective reporting bias. We need a consensus not just on what outcomes should be measured but also on how they should be measured and what constitutes clinically significant benefit, so that binary outcomes can be reported. Very few outcomes were reported in binary form. A number of outcomes, for example personal recovery and satisfaction, were not measured in any of the studies despite being deemed important. </p> <p>Only published scales that have been subject to validation (internal and external) should be used. Scales that have been written or adapted by study authors need to be independently validated. This will improve the certainty of the evidence and the ability to utilise the results in making decisions for practice and policy. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0287"> <h5 class="title">4. Future reviews</h5> <p>The difficulties in synthesising trials of complex interventions are not new; however, the complexity of differing interventions, with different interacting components and different aims and outcomes, has made undertaking this review a challenge. It may be useful if future reviews were able to capture both quantitative and qualitative data, for example by utilising an integrated review methodology in line with the Medical Research Council guidance, placing high importance on a qualitative understanding of mechanisms of change (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0155" title="CraigP , DieppeP , MacintyreS , MichieS , NazarethI , PetticrewM . Developing and evaluating complex interventions: the new Medical Research Council guidance. British Medical Journal2008;337:a1655. [DOI: 10.1136/bmj.a1655]">Craig 2008</a>). Furthermore, depending on emerging new evidence, it would be useful for a future update to report on service‐related outcomes such as cost‐effectiveness. This may facilitate decisions for collaborative care service development. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0288"> <h5 class="title">5. Strengthening the evidence base</h5> <p>We have been limited in the conclusions that can be drawn from this review by the certainty of the evidence. Appropriate sample sizes, refinement in choice of outcomes, longer follow‐up, and transparency in the randomisation and allocation process would significantly improve the evidence. Some of the ongoing trials may be more likely to resolve some of these methodological issues. </p> </section> </section> </section> </section> <section class="summaryOfFindings"> <div

This should include monitoring of mental state, medication use, medication adherence, side effects, social isolation, access to services and occupational status. An individual with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder should have a care plan developed jointly between primary care and secondary mental health services. Regular monitoring of physical health is also essential. With the consent of the service user, non‐professional carers should be consulted at regular intervals on the needs of the service user and should also be offered an assessment of their own specific needs (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0225" title="Schizophrenia: core interventions in the treatment and management of schizophrenia in adults in primary and secondary care (CG82).

Variation within and across countries is likely to be an important driver of differences in treatment effects across studies. In a World Health Organization (WHO) report, 42 low‐ and middle‐income countries/territories were involved in data collection, and connections between mental health and other relevant components of the health system, as well as non‐health sectors, were weak (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0268" title="World Health Organization, Wonca.

Moreover, there was minimal integration of mental health into primary health care. </p> <p>Since the 1980s, multidisciplinary community mental health teams (CMHTs) have been the main vehicle for delivering co‐ordinated, comprehensive, community‐based mental health services in the UK (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0202" title="KingdonD .

NICE guidance for schizophrenia suggests that though “CMHTs remain the mainstay of community mental healthcare, there is surprisingly little evidence to show that they are an effective way of organising services. As such, evidence for or against the effectiveness of CMHTs in the management of schizophrenia is insufficient to make any evidence‐based recommendations” (page 38, <a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0225" title="Schizophrenia: core interventions in the treatment and management of schizophrenia in adults in primary and secondary care (CG82). London: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.2009.">NICE 2009</a>). NICE guidance for bipolar disorder states “There is little evidence that CMHTs have advantages or disadvantages over other means of organising care for people with bipolar disorder” (page 144, <a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0226" title="NICE. NICE CG38. Bipolar Disorder. London: NICE, 2009.">NICE 2009b</a>). So, while there is good evidence to support intensive community services (e.g. intensive case management for severe mental illness; <a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0161" title="DieterichM , IrvingCB , ParkB , MarshallM . Intensive case management for severe mental illness. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2010, Issue 10. Art. No: CD007906. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007906]">Dieterich 2010</a>), there is less evidence to support large numbers of individuals who need lower‐intensity care either being managed by CMHTs or being discharged back to primary care. This fits with the wider context, which indicates that the state of research on the relationship between organisational factors and outcomes of mental health treatments requires strengthening with more studies in this area (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0166" title="FalkenströmF , GrantJ , HolmqvistR .

In the US, most individuals are managed in public sector systems where psychiatrists prescribe medications, non‐MDs such as social workers provide therapy and rehabilitative services, and primary care providers/GPs play a much more limited role. Other countries have varying emphasis on inpatient versus outpatient treatment, the role of PCPs versus psychiatrists and other mental health specialists, the availability of psychotropic medications, access to psychotherapy and rehabilitative treatments, and overall resources available for mental health care. In England, the Community Mental Health Framework for Adults and Older Adults provides an historic opportunity to achieve radical change in the design of community mental health care (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0224" title="NHS England and NHS Improvement and the National Collaborating Central for Mental Health.

This will be by moving away from siloed, hard‐to‐reach services towards joined‐up care and whole population approaches, and establishing a revitalised purpose and identity for community mental health services. It supports the development of Primary Care Networks, Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) and personalised care, including how these developments will help to improve care for people with severe mental illnesses. It is hoped that implementing this framework will break down the current barriers between: (1) mental health and physical health, (2) health, social care, voluntary, community and social enterprise organisations and local communities, and (3) primary and secondary care, to deliver integrated, personalised, place‐based and well co‐ordinated care. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0017"> <h4 class="title">Aim of review</h4> <p>As outlined above, integrated working and collaborative care may overcome some of the obstacles to optimal care provision for those with SMI diagnoses.

In our original review we noted that even when collaborative care interventions have similar components they can differ in the way these are provided (see Appendix 2 in <a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0274" title="ReillyS , PlannerC , GaskL , HannM , KnowlesS , DrussB , LesterH .

Each separate intervention might work in its own way to create the outcomes identified as important by the designers. Notwithstanding this, there is some evidence that explores how common components might lead to improved health outcomes. </p> <p>Collaborative care aims to improve quality of care by ensuring that, at an individual level, both patient and case manager and, at a system level, healthcare providers <i>work together</i> to address the needs of the patient, thus improving both physical and/or mental health outcomes depending on the specific aims of the intervention. Most research has focused on integrating mental health and primary care services, to facilitate communication and joint working between health professionals (e.g. GP, psychiatrist, nurse, pharmacist, psychologist)<i>,</i> provide the patient with care in a less stigmatised setting, promote evidence‐based practice and prevent loss of contact with services. A recent feasibility study suggests that for those with a diagnosis of psychosis this integration will lead to practitioners having a better understanding of patients’ needs and how to meet them, which in turn will mean that appropriate support is offered to the patient. Subsequently, this will promote behaviours that support outcomes of personal recovery, and improved mental and physical health (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0132" title="BakerE , Gwernan-JonesR , BrittenN , CoxM , McCabeC , RetzerA , et al.

At the interface between patient and case manager, the focus may be on better medication management, proactive follow‐up and self‐management, improving health outcomes and reducing unnecessary use of health resources such as emergency admissions. At the organisational level, actions such as feedback of patient information to the GP and adherence of workforces to specific evidence‐based guidelines and protocols may be key (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0170" title="GaskL , BowerP , LovellK , EscottD , ArcherJ , GilbodyS , et al.

We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating small‐study effects but are of limited power to detect such effects when there are few studies. We planned not to use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. As we only included eight studies, no funnel plots were produced for this review. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0097"> <h4 class="title">Data synthesis</h4> <p>If possible, we would have reported the absolute differences between intervention and control groups for continuous outcomes. However, as we found different outcome measures for the same outcomes, we predominantly reported standardised mean differences. For binary outcomes, we reported relative percent differences in outcomes between the intervention and control groups. Where applicable, we synthesised the results using a random‐effects model to provide a pooled estimate of effect from continuous and binary data. Although we could have assessed heterogeneity for each outcome and used a fixed‐effect model when this heterogeneity was considered to be small, we opted to use random‐effects models regardless, in acknowledgement of the differences in collaborative care interventions, the populations and the clinical settings across the different studies. Analyses were based on the ITT population. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0098"> <h4 class="title">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</h4> <p>For heterogeneous outcomes, we checked the data to ensure that they had been correctly extracted and entered and that there were no unit of analysis errors. If high levels of heterogeneity are observed, meta‐analysis is often not appropriate. If there is considerable variation in results, and particularly if there is inconsistency in the direction of effect, it may be misleading to quote an average value for the intervention effect. Where possible, when substantial heterogeneity was present, we explored possible reasons for this in the context of the following pre‐specified characteristics of studies: </p> <p> <ul id="CD009531-list-0023"> <li> <p>Variations in implementation of the collaborative care intervention and healthcare systems. </p> </li> <li> <p>Variations in types of patients included: comparison of studies that dealt solely with people with schizophrenia, other types of schizophrenia‐like psychosis, people with bipolar affective disorder or people with other types of psychosis and those that also include people with other severe mental illnesses, e.g. depression and those with a dual diagnosis. </p> </li> <li> <p>Quality of study: comparison of high‐ and low‐quality studies.</p> </li> </ul> </p> <p>If exploration of these subgroups offered no clear explanation for the heterogeneity, we would have considered other post hoc subgroups. If other characteristics of the relevant studies were identified (post hoc) as a possible cause of heterogeneity, we would have presented the subgroup analyses alongside relevant discussion. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0099"> <h4 class="title">Sensitivity analysis</h4> <p>We planned the following sensitivity analyses:</p> <p> <ul id="CD009531-list-0024"> <li> <p>Assumptions for attrition: we performed a sensitivity analysis in order to examine the robustness of the conclusions when including data according to the assumptions that were made regarding people lost to follow‐up (<a href="#CD009531-sec-0084">Dealing with missing data</a>), where we compared the findings of the primary outcome when we used our assumption compared with completer data only.

We excluded 24 records because they were not RCTs (see <a href="#CD009531-sec-0027">Types of studies</a>), 110 records because the intervention was not described as collaborative care by the trialists (<a href="#CD009531-sec-0029">Types of interventions</a>) and 43 records because the sample did not meet the participant criteria for inclusion (see <a href="#CD009531-sec-0028">Types of participants</a>).

Risk of bias 2.0 (RoB 2) assesses the risk of bias at outcome level. To balance rigour with the burden of assessment, we assessed the risk of bias only for the review's primary outcomes and the outcomes reported in our summary of findings table. This also meant that we assessed risk of bias in at least one outcome per study. We therefore assessed risk of bias at all time points. </p> <p> <ol id="CD009531-list-0028"> <li> <p>Quality of life: <a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0001" title="BauerMS , BiswasK , KilbourneA .

Although this does not negatively impact the appropriateness of the measure, there is interplay between the impossibility of masking participants in psychosocial interventions and the possibility of social desirability bias when measuring outcomes. When assessing risk of bias for outcomes using self‐report measures, we have considered the participant to be an outcome assessor in addition to the researcher assessor. However, we did not consider the unmasking of these participant outcome assessors to be sufficient justification to increase the bias risk.

In an attempt to explain this heterogeneity, we created a subgroup of studies that we categorised as ‘pharmacy‐based collaborative care’. The collaborative care intervention in these studies was delivered in India (a lower middle‐income country). This was based on the roles and focus of the pharmacist being narrower than the ‘case manager’ role in the other studies.

We found this study outcome to have a low risk of bias. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to test the assumption that those participants who had withdrawn from the trial had experienced an outcome by the end of the trial (i.e. psychiatric admission) at the same rate at which those followed up experienced the outcome, by allocated group. The results of the sensitivity analysis were broadly consistent. The results show that the collaborative care intervention reduced the proportion of psychiatric admissions in year two and other admissions in year three. However, the reporting of admissions by year (rather than cumulatively) does make it more difficult to assess the mid‐ to long‐term impact that collaborative care has on the group as a whole; it is not possible to know whether it is the same people who are hospitalised year‐on‐year or whether some patients never get admitted to hospital. </p> <p>Longer‐term data in one study captured symptoms at 24 months using the Internal State Scale (ISS) (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0005" title="Amy Kilbourne.

We suggest that more, longer‐term follow‐up studies are needed, with a minimum of 12 months follow‐up, ideally longer, to enable us to better understand the impact of collaborative care. This is in part because collaborative care is a re‐structured way of working with service users, which takes time to take effect. People would access the intervention on a long‐term basis if it was to be implemented in healthcare systems, and therefore the benefits are more likely to become apparent over a longer period of time accessing the service. Additionally, the long‐term, chronic nature of severe mental illness means that changes in quality of life, recovery and mental state are likely to take longer to manifest than in other mental health populations, such as those with depression, due to problems of agency, identity and hope (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0257" title="TewJ , RamonS , SladeM , BirdV , MeltonJ , Le BoutillierJC .

There appears to be confusion with authors aligning the correct scale to a specific version of a tool and some are being used interchangeably. This was particularly noted with medication adherence scales not being interpreted according to the guidance for specific versions. This presented a problem in that the data did not fall into the range of values permissible by the scale; therefore, the outcome could not be included in our analysis. Additionally, some trial authors failed to reference specific tools or versions of the tools used in their data outcomes. One of our primary outcomes, personal recovery, was not measured by any of the studies despite being highlighted as important by those with ongoing mental health problems (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0237" title="RetzerA , SayersR , PinfoldV , GibsonJ , KeeleyT , TaylorG , et al.

All of the evidence in relation to the primary outcomes is direct in that the concept of interest was directly measured and that the population of the study was those with an SMI diagnosis (either bipolar or schizophrenia). However, as noted in <a href="#CD009531-tbl-0003">Table 2</a>, most of the studies included in our review used an intervention that does not meet our 'core' definition of collaborative care (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0179" title="GunnJ , DiggensJ , HegartyK , BlashkiG .

[DOI: 10.1186/1472-6963-6-88]">Gunn 2006</a>). Additionally, we have used some study outcomes to indirectly measure concepts in our primary outcomes: number of psychiatric admissions as a measure of intervention safety and quality of life physical health sub‐domain as a measure of physical health.

In line with GRADE guidance, we calculated the optimal information size to aid in determining for which outcomes imprecision was an issue (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0248" title="SchünemannHJ , HigginsJPT , VistGE , GlasziouP , AklEA , SkoetzN , GuyattGH .

Typically, larger sample sizes are required for binary outcomes. As a result, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for binary outcomes (mental state (schizophrenia symptoms) at 12 months, and psychiatric admissions at 12 months) on the basis of imprecision, but none of the continuous outcomes. Further studies of collaborative care in relation to these outcomes would improve the precision of evidence. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0274"> <h3 class="title" id="CD009531-sec-0274">Other considerations</h3> <section id="CD009531-sec-0275"> <h4 class="title">Publication bias</h4> <p>Publication bias is the concept that undesirable results are not disseminated, creating a skewed evidence base.

Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 6.1 (updated September 2020). Cochrane, 2020. Available from www.training.cochrane.org/handbook.">Schünemann 2020</a>). We considered the effect size in relation to hospital admissions at 12 months to be very large, regardless of other factors, as the RR exceeds 5.0. The guidance suggests that this should result in an increase in the certainty of evidence. However, due to the very small number of events (particularly in the control arm) resulting in substantial uncertainty in the estimation and therefore a very large confidence interval, we have not upgraded the certainty of evidence for this outcome. We did not increase the certainty of evidence for any other outcomes on the basis of effect size. </p> </section> <section id="CD009531-sec-0277"> <h4 class="title">Overall certainty of evidence</h4> <p>We rated the certainty of the evidence for binary schizophrenia symptoms, disability (proxy for social functioning) and psychiatric admissions at 12 months as low. For physical and mental quality of life at 12 months and for depressive and manic bipolar symptoms at 12 months, we considered the certainty of evidence to be very low. The low certainty of evidence in the included studies makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions in relation to the impact of collaborative care on the outcomes presented in our summary of findings table. This highlights the need for further good‐quality studies, with particular attention to the following: participants and researchers masked prior to randomisation, participant retention strategies to reduce dropout, sufficient sample sizes, and publication of and adherence to analysis plans. The nature of the interventions utilised in these studies, and/or the detail of the description of these interventions, makes it impossible for us to use this evidence to comment on the effectiveness of collaborative care that meets Gunn's four core elements (<a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0179" title="GunnJ , DiggensJ , HegartyK , BlashkiG .

Further evidence, utilising studies that use interventions meeting these core elements, is required (see <a href="#CD009531-tbl-0006">Table 5</a> for suggested future study design).

The Cochrane Schizophrenia searches for studies used a specialised register, which is compiled from systematic searches of major databases, and handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings. The search strategy includes terms to describe schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐type disorders, severe mental illness and psychosis, but not 'bipolar disorder'. To limit this potential bias in the search strategy, we supplemented the electronic searches with reference list searches and contacted experts in the field of SMI and collaborative care, who were asked to identify published and unpublished research that they were either involved in or aware of (see <a href="#CD009531-sec-0062">Searching other resources</a>; <a href="#CD009531-fig-0001">Figure 1</a>). The search strategy is <a href="https://schizophrenia.cochrane.org/register-trials" target="_blank">published online</a>. Secondly, studies that were identified by experts in the field as relevant were excluded if the intervention was not described as 'collaborative care' by the study authors in the papers or reports (for example, <a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0018" title="ByngR .

<p><sup>a</sup> Downgraded two levels due to risk of bias: in two studies this outcome was rated as some concerns of risk of bias; in one study this outcome was rated as high risk of bias.<br/><sup>b</sup> There is a heterogeneity of direction of effect across studies reporting this outcome. However, due to overlapping confidence intervals and low I2 we have not downgraded the certainty of evidence in relation to inconsistency.<br/><sup>c</sup> Downgraded one level for indirectness. The interventions used in this study did not utilise Gunn's elements of collaborative care, although they were described by the study authors as collaborative care interventions. <br/><sup>d</sup> Downgraded one level for imprecision. This was based on considering a range of scenarios with varying control group rates and target relative risk reductions, the most extreme of which pertains to the assumption of a control group rate of 50% and a target relative risk reduction of 30%, which requires a total of 338 participants in order to achieve 80% power at the 5% significance level. The number of participants required for precision was not met in relation to this outcome.<br/><sup>e</sup> GRADE Handbook guidance recommends upgrading the certainty of evidence where the risk ratio exceeds 5.0. However, we have chosen not to upgrade the certainty of evidence in relation to this outcome due to the small numbers of observed events (particularly in the control arm) and therefore the substantial uncertainty of the point estimate. <br/><sup>f</sup> Downgraded one level for indirectness. The intervention used in this study did not utilise Gunn's elements of collaborative care, although it was described by the study authors as a collaborative care intervention. Additionally we are utilising quality of life (physical health domain) as a proxy for physical health. <br/><sup>g</sup> Downgraded one level for indirectness. The intervention used in this study did not utilise Gunn's elements of collaborative care, although it was described by the study authors as a collaborative care intervention. Additionally we are utilising disability as a proxy for social functioning. </p> </div> </td> </tr> </tfoot> </table> <div class="scolaris-modal-title">Figures and Tables - </div> <div class="table-viewer-caption"> <div class="table-heading"><span class="table-label">Summary of findings 1.</span> <span class="table-title">Summary of findings table ‐ Collaborative care compared to usual care for severe mental illness</span></div> </div> <div class="tools"><a class="tableList" href="/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009531.pub3/full#CD009531-tbl-0001">Navigate to table in review</a></div> </div> <div class="table"> <table data-id="CD009531-tbl-0002"> <div class="table-heading"><span class="table-label">Table 1.</span> <span class="table-title">Collaborative care components of included studies (based on Gunn 2006 definition)</span></div> <tbody> <tr> <td align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"></td> <th align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" scope="col" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Multi‐professional</b> </p> <p><b>approach</b> </p> </th> <td align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"></td> <td align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"></td> <td align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"></td> <th align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" scope="col" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Structured management plan</b> </p> </th> <th align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" scope="col" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Follow‐ups</b> </p> </th> <th align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" scope="col" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Enhanced interprofessional communication</b> </p> </th> <th align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" scope="col" valign="bottom"> <p><b>No. components</b> </p> </th> </tr> <tr> <td align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Primary care professional</b> </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Mental health professional</b> </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Case manager</b> </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Other</b> </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td> </tr> <tr> <th align="" class="headercell" colspan="1" rowspan="1" scope="col" valign="top"> <p><a href="./references#CD009531-bbs2-0001" title="BauerMS , BiswasK , KilbourneA .
