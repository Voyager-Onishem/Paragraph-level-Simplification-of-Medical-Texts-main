Advocacy may help women who are in, or have left, an abusive intimate relationship, to stop or reduce repeat victimisation and overcome consequences of the abuse. Advocacy primarily involves education, safety planning support and increasing access to different services.

Ten further studies (3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 1 intervention process evaluation, 1 qualitative study, 2 mixed methods studies, 2 surveys of women, and 1 mixed methods study of women and staff) did not fit the original criteria but added useful information, as befitting a realist approach.

Potentially, if undertaken for long enough, advocacy should benefit an abused woman in terms of at least one outcome providing the goals are matched to each woman's needs.

It includes coercive control, physical, sexual, economic, emotional and/or economic abuse. Trained people, known as advocates, can actively support abused women to make safety plans, cope with and take steps to reduce the abuse, and access community resources. This is known as advocacy. Advocacy can take many forms. </p> <p><b>Review question</b> </p> <p>We wished to understand which advocacy interventions work to help abused women, under what circumstances, and which women may benefit. This is called a realist approach. It assumes that we often develop a superficial knowledge of how something happens (e.g. how advocacy works), based on simple measurements and observations. A realist approach tries to understand what is really happening at a deeper level by exploring different effects in different conditions. </p> <p><b>Methods</b> </p> <p>We searched scientific literature worldwide up to January 2019 for any relevant studies.</p> <p><b>Key findings</b> </p> <p>We found 98 studies from 15 countries. Of the 88 core studies, 37 asked advocates about their views and experiences and seven asked abused women about advocacy (two of these also asked staff). The other 44 core studies helped us understand the way advocacy works and how effective it is. We included 10 additional studies that did not fit the original criteria but added useful information, as befitting a realist approach. Of these, three were randomised controlled trials (RCTs; a type of experiment in which participants are randomly allocated to two or more interventions), one was an intervention process evaluation, one was a qualitative (e.g. focus groups, interviews) study, two studies used mixed methods (a combination of qualitative and quantitative research) to explore women's experiences, two were surveys of women, and one was a mixed methods study of women and staff. We were unable to obtain the full texts of two studies that we thought might be core and three further relevant studies are still ongoing. </p> <p>Advocacy interventions varied considerably in duration, participating staff (e.g. nurses, psychologists, social workers), and setting (e.g. healthcare settings, domestic violence refuges or shelters). </p> <p>In the studies, women and advocates agreed that the following were all important parts of advocacy: education and information on abuse and on women's rights and sources of help (resources); active referral to, and help in accessing other services; assessment of risk of repeat abuse; and safety planning to avoid it. Trust in the advocate is important and more likely when the advocate and the woman share an ethnic background or the advocate was also abused. Advocates must help women consider their best options, depending on things like ethnicity, immigration status, where they live, the severity and type of the abuse experienced and finances. There are trade‐offs when making decisions to reduce the abuse and women's safety was not necessarily at greatest risk from staying with the abuser. Advocacy could potentially have some benefits for abused women, if undertaken for long enough, but its goals need to match each woman's needs. It may take months to have an effect. Two studies (one involving the police and one in an antenatal clinic) found that where abuse is severe to start with, some interventions may possibly prompt the abuser to increase the abuse. Advocates want to help women and can get stressed if they do not feel helpful enough, so they need support from organisations and other advocates, including repeat training, debriefs, and funding to do their job well. </p> <p><b>Quality of the evidence</b> </p> <p>Our confidence in the key findings varied between moderate and high. However, some themes (the effect on outcomes of women being physically dependent on their abuser, being pregnant or having children) were less well supported by evidence and further, good‐quality research is needed to confirm findings. Researchers should be careful when choosing how to measure abuse so that measures have more meaning for advocates and abused women, thus increasing the usefulness of future reviews. Further evidence from studies where participants are followed up for years would be helpful. More economic analyses are needed to establish if current advocacy interventions are the best way of spending money for abused women. </p> </div> </section> <section id="vls" style="display: none"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title">Visual summary<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i></h2> </div> <a href="" target="_blank"><img alt="visual summary" src=""/></a> </section> <section class="conclusions"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD013135-sec-0173" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Authors' conclusions <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> <div class="section-language-toggles"> <span class="section-languages-legend">available in</span> <nav class="section-languages"> <li class="section-language"> <a class="is-active" href="full/en#CD013135-sec-0173">English</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/es#CD013135-sec-0259">Español</a> </li> </nav> </div> </div> <section class="authorsConclusions" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD013135-sec-0173"></div> Our strategic objectives were to explain successes, failures, partial successes and small effect sizes in published, empirical studies of advocacy interventions delivered in different settings, and, in particular, to explain mechanisms of effect in heterogeneous, complex, advocacy‐containing interventions. This reflects our higher‐order (realist) question (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0204" title="GreenhalghT , MacfarlaneF , SteedL , WaltonR . What works for whom in pharmacist‐led smoking cessation support: realist review. BMC Medicine2016;14:209. [DOI: 10.1186/s12916‐016‐0749‐5] ">Greenhalgh 2016</a>). We were only partially able to meet this as we had low confidence in the evidence regarding complexity. Nonetheless we have been able to clarify the active ingredients of advocacy and to develop hypotheses linking contexts, mechanisms and outcomes. Our findings should enable researchers and developers to design more effective advocacy interventions in the future, determine which outcomes to include, and improve their reporting and evaluation. In addition, this review will lead policy makers and practitioners to a better understanding of advocacy interventions, and their likely benefit in the local contexts in which they operate. <section id="CD013135-sec-0174"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013135-sec-0174">Implications for practice</h3> <p>Our results suggest that the use of advocacy rests on sound theoretical underpinnings, and confirms that its core ingredients are: education and information on intimate partner abuse; rights and resources; active referral and liaising with other services; risk assessment and safety planning. Our analysis has also enabled us to make some recommendations. Our panel prioritised our first recommendations (the essential principles), which were that: </p> <p> <ul id="CD013135-list-0050"> <li> <p>the influence of the abuser on the woman must always be taken into account, and that</p> </li> <li> <p>advocates should always exercise cultural humility and bear in mind intersectionalities in considering women's vulnerabilities and the trade‐offs of abuse‐related decisions in the contexts of the individual women's lives. </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p>It was important to consider:</p> <p> <ul id="CD013135-list-0051"> <li> <p>the severity and type of abuse,</p> </li> <li> <p>whether the woman still lived with the abuser, and</p> </li> <li> <p>the women's economic and legal dependencies.</p> </li> </ul> </p> <p>These were relevant across recommendations and may necessitate advocates working to remove structural barriers to resource access by marginalised women. </p> <p>The evidence is less clear for physical dependencies and seemed indicated, but not certain, for pregnant women and women with children. </p> <p>Women's safety was not necessarily at greatest risk from staying with the abuser.</p> <p>Potentially, advocacy could always have some benefits for abused women, if it is undertaken for long enough, but the goals of the advocacy need to match the woman's needs; there may be an impact trajectory and some outcomes may take months to be determined. </p> <p>A good therapeutic alliance was important and might be improved when advocates are matched with the women they see on ethnicity or abuse experience. We identified significant challenges for advocates that related to intra‐ and inter‐organisational working, vicarious traumatisation, and lack of clarity on how much support to give women, given the need for an individualised approach. To work effectively, advocates need ongoing training, role clarity, access to resources and peer and institutional support. </p> <p>Our final model (<a href="#CD013135-fig-0003">Figure 3</a>) highlights the complex way that factors combine and interact for effective advocacy. </p> </section> <section id="CD013135-sec-0175"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013135-sec-0175">Implications for research</h3> <p>We have presented throughout this review hypotheses that need to be tested in further research that might extend our theory to different situations or types of advocacy or empowerment interventions. </p> <p>Future interventions and studies should consider the different mechanisms and contexts identified in this review and the way they link to outcomes and unanticipated effects. In relation to abused women, contextual factors to consider include: ethnicity and race; immigration difficulties; resource loss and gain and resource balances; social and geographic locations; economic dependence (and the difference from low socioeconomic status or low income). There needs to be more consideration of these different contexts when interpreting outcomes, and more understanding of the effects on outcomes when women have children. The ways that advocates can be supported need to be better understood. </p> <p>There should be more consistency in studies with regard to the outcomes used. These should be explicitly theoretically driven, and should be measured using more standardised scales where this is relevant. Some studies develop an outcome measure specifically for their study, which leads to problems in interpreting the evidence. Study outcomes should be considered in relation to the mechanisms and contexts elucidated in this review and that consider the trajectories of impact in different groups of women. </p> <p>More longitudinal research is needed since some effects are likely to attenuate over time and others may not emerge until years after an intervention has ended. It may be that two years is optimal for follow‐up and that beyond that it is challenging to disentangle the effects that external factors may have on outcomes. However, this may depend on what is being evaluated, and single‐subject research designs may be helpful (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0285" title="SmithJD .

">Smith 2012</a>), which can determine exactly when equilibrium in effect is reached for different outcomes, that is, when effect plateaus rather than continuing to increase, and follow‐up may become unhelpful. It is likely that this will be different for vulnerable and marginalised women. </p> <p>Longitudinal research is also needed to determine longer‐term mechanisms of effect; for example, considering recidivism, mental health, resource acquisition and empowerment, all of which appear central to advocacy interventions. </p> <p>Further work is needed to ascertain how advocacy interventions can be tailored to cultural variations between ethnic groups (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0275" title="RodriguezMA , SabaG .

But there have been moves in some countries to change this. For example, section 76 of the Serious Crime Act ('s 76') of England and Wales makes "coercive or controlling behaviour" that has a "serious effect" on the victim a criminal offence. The provision came into force in England and Wales on 29 December 2015.

However, there is some indication as to what these mechanisms may be and we began this review with these mechanisms in mind. Empowerment tends to be described as the mechanism that needs to operate for the active ingredients of advocacy interventions to activate. There are several theoretical frameworks that take empowerment as the mechanism for change at the societal, community and individual level. At a societal level, from feminist perspectives, the causes of intimate partner abuse stem from a social and cultural patriarchal ideology that allows men to control women through power and violence. The experience of intimate partner abuse is understood to be fundamentally disempowering (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0299" title="VigursCA , Schucan BirdK , QuyK , GoughD .

The proposed solution to this social and cultural problem, then, is one that aims to effect change through the empowerment of women at a social and cultural level. Typically in this approach, advocates can be seen to facilitate access to resources that are a woman's right, by connecting and liaising with community supports and services at a community or organisational level for a co‐ordinated response to intimate partner abuse. Such resources might include housing, legal aid and welfare advice, for example. </p> <p>Advocacy approaches that operate at the individual (micro) level to empower women tend to focus on helping her to change behaviours, such as safety planning and help‐seeking behaviours. Such approaches will typically include or facilitate access to: cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT); counselling; or motivational interviewing. Not only do these approaches change a woman's ways of thinking, they may also alleviate depressive symptoms and improve mental health and well‐being. Also at the individual level, strengths‐based approaches aim to work with survivors of abuse to increase their knowledge, agency and self‐efficacy.

The coming together of different approaches with different theoretical underpinnings within advocacy programmes (typified by trauma‐informed approaches) has not been formally explored to determine additive mechanisms of effect.

This is appropriate to determine what works, given that these studies control for external factors to show a clear cause and effect relationship between the intervention itself and specific outcomes. However, meta‐analysis of positive effect, negative effect and no effect, and heterogeneity between and within studies, essentially cancel each other out, to little or no effect overall, masking the finding that the intervention may work for some people and not others, or only under some conditions. A realist review draws on more diverse study types, as its aim, the desired output, is a 'programme theory'.

The results of the realist review may better support such decisions, inasmuch as they have made it clearer which mechanisms lead to the effectiveness of advocacy. The realist review has also, we hope, provided more clarity in its approach of drawing more broadly on the literature where this can provide further information (e.g. on theoretical underpinnings). </p> <p>A further issue that we wished to address is that the outcomes of a complex intervention (and indeed any intervention) are context‐dependent, that is, they are affected by various individual, community and societal factors, from the ethnicity and socioeconomic status of the abused women involved to the role and training of the person delivering the advocacy, as well as the setting and the precise content of what is offered to whom (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0260" title="PawsonR , BoazA , GraysonL , LongA , BarnesC .

It is important, therefore, to consider not just what works, but where, in what circumstances, for whom and how, with more focus not only on the interaction of different components of an intervention but also on the contexts in which they are played out. These data are available from, and reported by, many of the effectiveness studies of advocacy interventions, but they have not been considered in terms of mechanisms of ‘what works'. The realist review approach affords us the structure by which to do so. This realist review approach will also enable politicians, policy makers, practitioners and commissioners of services to understand existing interventions and identify those active ingredients that may be transferable to their local contexts. This is important in the context of funding cuts for intimate partner abuse‐specific services (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0296" title="TowersJ , WalbyS .

We resolved any differences through discussion and there was no need for adjudication by our stakeholder group. This group was comprised of members of an existing stakeholder group with whom we are working on the development of core outcome sets. The group included policymakers, academics, women who have experienced abuse, and advocacy providers, and they had oversight of the study findings. We consulted with the group by email or other remote means (e.g. videoconferencing). Although abused women participated in the group, we did not apply for ethical approval since these women were acting as consultants, rather than study participants. We did, however, maintain ethical principles. We asked this group to check emerging theory and comment on key decisions.

Once we developed this list, we supplemented it with: </p> <p> <ul id="CD013135-list-0008"> <li> <p>papers identified through citation chaining (through backward citation tracking of reference lists and Google Scholar forward citation tracking) of all papers that we judged as core to our realist question; </p> </li> <li> <p>papers identified through the 'search similar citations' function on PubMed, after entering the title of each key paper in turn; and </p> </li> <li> <p>papers linked to the effectiveness studies, identified as part of an integrated mixed‐methods study or as a 'sibling study' (e.g. qualitative, economic or process evaluations associated with specific effectiveness studies). </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p>We then repeated the scoping phase process described in this section using the supplementary searches described directly above. We initially used a comprehensive sampling approach, because we did not deem an alternative approach, such as theoretical or extreme case sampling, to be necessary. This was because logistically we could manage the number of papers retrieved so there was no need to delimit them. </p> <p>In all cases, CV reviewed the full‐text papers and made a judgement as to whether the paper included sufficient descriptive detail or theoretical discussion, or both, to contribute to the explanatory theory, excluding those that did not. CR checked a 10% subsample of included and excluded papers for agreement. At the first check, both review authors expressed uncertainty as to whether to include studies that described advocacy but did not consider intimate partner abuse. After discussion, we agreed that non‐consideration of intimate partner abuse should be an exclusion criterion, as the specific goals of other types of advocacy differed (though the goals were similar at the societal level it was not possible to translate these to our research question). The two review authors then re‐considered all papers (CV reviewed all papers while CR reviewed a subset) and this time found no points of difference. </p> <p>The review authors identified a number of existing explanatory theories connecting advocacy interventions to both intended and unanticipated outcomes during this phase, including advocacy as part of a multi‐component intervention. This enabled us to draw up a preliminary list of possible theories, which we described under the 'How the intervention might work' section in our protocol (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0322" title="RivasC , VigursC .

These were feminist, psychological, strengths‐based and trauma‐informed approaches to empowerment, which we considered from prior experience to be especially relevant. We further added to this list as the review developed. This list was generated solely in relation to domestic abuse advocacy. While it would have been more in keeping with the realist approach to relate these more broadly to other forms of advocacy, when we tried to do so ‐ and we were open to this throughout the review process ‐ we found that the other forms of advocacy differed considerably in approach and could not, therefore, contribute useful information. </p> <p>We repeated this process iteratively for all new papers added to our inclusion list until we exhausted this search, at which point we moved to phase 2. </p> </section> </section> <section id="CD013135-sec-0046"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013135-sec-0046">Phase 2: theory generation</h3> <p>As we extracted data from studies identified in the scoping phase and generated candidate theories as well as detail on relevant contexts, mechanisms and outcomes, we further augmented our list of included studies.

These gaps could potentially be filled from studies that described relevant theories and mediating factors in other settings and for other types of intervention even though they might not specifically include any mention of advocacy or abuse. Such studies could include 'kinship studies' that may share a common theoretical origin with the starting‐point paper, links to a common antecedent study or a contemporaneous or spatial context.

In developing our theory, we found examples where the outcomes were unanticipated, when considering the contexts and mechanisms. This occurred for example in women from rural or ethnic minority groups, and with some judiciary‐based interventions. This led us to a particular focus on the role of settings, support for advocacy, and the trade‐offs involved in women's responses to interventions. This in turn produced new research questions, in which we asked whether women's experiences, needs and desires were met by advocacy services, what were women's expectations of advocates, whose perspective matters and whether this corresponded to the active ingredients of advocacy? </p> <p>Where there were gaps in the data (i.e. where CMO configurations were incomplete because the mechanisms were not clear), and we were unable to fill these from further searches, we used the 'Final data synthesis approaches' ‐ described directly above‐ in abductive reasoning to infer mechanisms from the data that were available. This is consistent with the realist approach. In so doing we considered how the mechanism could be explained from what we knew about the context and outcomes and also theoretical commentary or discussions within the literature. </p> <p>In <a href="./full#CD013135-sec-0072">Results</a> we describe the final realist theory using narrative and summary tables, a logic model and theory graphics, drawing insights from across the sources.

We therefore considered 37 studies that focused on staff performance of their professional role in intimate partner abuse services. In keeping with the nature of the realist review, we included studies that sought information from a range of intimate partner abuse service providers and not just advocates, if we judged that they reported findings of relevance to advocacy itself. None of these studies provided effectiveness data ‐ although four survey‐based studies undertook correlation and mediation analyses. </p> <p>Five of the 37 studies used a qualitative focus group or group interview approach.

In the outreach condition, a community‐based agency phoned women and gave them detailed information about the resources and services on offer; the agency had been told the woman's circumstances, so she did not have to explain this, and the conversation was confidential. For the referral condition, a system‐based advocate from the prosecuting attorney's office or police department contacted women and gave them only basic information about community‐based agencies, and the conversation was not confidential.

It is perhaps for this reason that the mechanisms of effect in empowerment may also be measured as the outcomes of empowerment activities in advocacy. </p> <p>Advocacy itself may be considered as a resource, one that it is assumed will enable and encourage and empower women to access other resources such as social welfare, housing services, education and employment services. It is assumed that the trade‐offs of empowerment and divesting themselves of the abuse are less than the benefits that accrue. However, the women's responses to the advocacy resource will be affected by personal, local and structural factors. </p> <p>These theoretical assumptions, with their reference to resources and capabilities, align with the capability approach of <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0282" title="SenA . Commodities and Capabilities. New York: Elsevier Science, 1985. ">Sen 1985</a>. The capability approach considers that people aim to achieve the best utility or quality of life they can, as affected by the core concepts of ‘functionings' and ‘capabilities'. Functionings are states of being and doing, such as being financially independent or going to work. A woman's capabilities represent her effective freedom to choose between different functioning combinations that she values. Resources (such as advocacy) are inputs whose value or impact depends upon an individuals' capabilities to convert them into valuable functionings (the mechanisms of CMOs in realist analysis) and the functionings that they have to choose from. This might be affected by individual factors (such as a person's disability, language ability, economic dependency), local factors (such as subsidies for housing, community norms and attitudes) and structural factors (such as policies and the funding of services); these are the contexts of CMOs in realist analysis. An individual's capabilities set is the set of valuable functionings that an individual has real access to. Achieved functionings (the outcomes of the CMOs in realist analysis) are those they actually select. Hence this framework assumes the individual has choices. Utility is considered as an output, because what people choose to do and to be affects their sense of subjective well‐being. Utlity, in the form of subjective well‐being (such as feeling happy), is also a valuable functioning in its own right within the capability approach. The relationships between the different elements of this framework are shown in <a href="#CD013135-fig-0004">Figure 4</a>.

How Women in Domestic Violence Shelters Experience Empowermen [MA thesis]. Winnipeg: Faculty of Graduate Studies of The University of Manitoba, 2016. ">Kenyon 2016</a> was the only study to explore how abused women themselves defined empowerment. Four inter‐related empowerment processes emerged from that study: self‐reflection; gaining clarity; acquiring knowledge; and building community. Three key features of shelters that were perceived to impact empowerment and could be measured as outcomes were: increasing safety; forming connections; and promoting self‐efficacy (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0044" title="KenyonKM . How Women in Domestic Violence Shelters Experience Empowermen [MA thesis]. Winnipeg: Faculty of Graduate Studies of The University of Manitoba, 2016. ">Kenyon 2016</a>). Women's perspectives on what they needed therefore overlapped with what advocacy provided but included the desire for space for self‐reflection, which may be seen as a mechanism for renewing self‐worth. However it is important to note that women were rarely asked directly about their perspectives, with only seven studies focusing on them. The outcomes women most want are being considered further in a core outcome set development study being undertaken by researchers on intimate partner abuse in which Rivas is involved (with two workstreams, in the Children and Families Policy Research Unit (CPRU) (<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/children-policy-research/" target="_blank">www.ucl.ac.uk/children‐policy‐research</a>), and the Violence, Abuse and Mental Health (VAMH) Network (<a href="https://www.vamhn.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.vamhn.co.uk</a>), which is funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI, formerly Research Councils UK (RCUK)). <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0067" title="PerezS , JohnsonDM , WrightCV . The attenuating effect of empowerment on IPV‐related PTSD symptoms in battered women living in domestic violence shelters. Violence against Women2012;18:102. ">Perez 2012</a> operationalised empowerment advocacy for abused women in terms of: positive self‐evaluation and self‐esteem, a sense of personal control or self‐efficacy, self‐nurturance and self‐care (capabilities or mechanisms); comfort/distress ratio (which may act as a mechanism, outcome or utility); gender role and cultural identity awareness (normative factors and capabilities); effective problem‐solving skills, competent use of assertiveness skills, effective access to multiple economic, social, and community resources, gender and cultural flexibility and socially constructive activism (by improving women's achieved functionings or outcomes). This operationalisation thus cuts across the different domains of our model. </p> <p>Apart from consideration of repeat abuse itself, which was seen as key to well‐being, we were interested in testing what seemed to be a clear focus on outcomes associated with theoretical considerations of empowerment across all studies, as demonstrated in particular by the variables considered in several modelling studies. We explored these outcomes at the start of our review to see whether these demonstrated achieved functionings and utilities as a result of empowerment‐based advocacy. We detail these here before moving onto our CMO configurations. </p> <section id="CD013135-sec-0090"> <h5 class="title">Finding 1: empowerment and psychosocial and well‐being outcomes</h5> <p>Feelings of helplessness, lack of self‐efficacy, reduced mental well‐being, and hopelessness were often equated with disempowerment, one or more of which were outcomes in many studies. Increasing women's capabilities through knowledge and skill development was not directly measured in studies, but these were routinely built up within intimate partner abuse advocacy interventions as specific components of practice. Hope involves reflection on a positive future and therefore can provide the motivation for changes in behaviour as well as being important to coping and well‐being (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0286" title="SnyderCR .

In total, 217 women were randomised 2:1 to Nia (n = 130) and treatment as usual (n = 87). In the first paper, the study authors tested hierarchical linear regression models with the intent‐to‐treat sample, which indicated that the Nia intervention reduced depressive symptoms and general distress compared with treatment as usual. The between‐group differences were sustained throughout follow‐up of up to 12 months. While Nia was not associated with greater reductions than treatment as usual in suicidal ideation or symptoms of PTSD, those women in the Nia arm who were exposed to further IPV showed attenuation in suicidal ideation compared to women in the treatment‐as‐usual arm; thus, the intervention was protective against effects of IPV. The analysis considered total scores of the scale for suicidal ideation. The second paper found that restricting analysis to only one of the two subscales gave clear group differences. In the same paper, the study authors also explored the mechanisms for Nia, by examining the relationships between primary psychological outcomes, religious well‐being (as a proxy for religious coping) and existential well‐being, and adaptive and maladaptive coping in the same group of women. Bootstrap estimates were used to test two, multiple mediator models. In both models, the intervention condition was the independent variable; and religious well‐being, existential well‐being, adaptive coping, and maladaptive coping were the parallel mediators. In one model, suicidal ideation was the outcome variable, and in the other, depressive symptoms were the outcome variable. Post‐intervention variables were used for the analyses. Results supported the hypothesis that existential well‐being mediates the treatment effect on suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms; both symptoms were clearly reduced post‐intervention compared with treatment as usual (independent t‐test 1.91, P = 0.06), as levels of existential well‐being increased. This accords with the capability approach, where utility feeds back into outcomes (achieved functionings). </p> <p>The third paper by <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0085" title="KaslowNJ , LeinerAS , ReviereSL , JacksonE , BetheaK , BhajuJ , et al.

When we began to configure the CMOs in our synthesis and look for patterns, we reviewed these studies' potential explanations alongside alternative possibilities and tested them against the other data in the review (as explained in <a href="#CD013135-sec-0043">Methods</a>) and against our emerging theory. As we tested CMOs against our theory, we also populated gaps in the CMOs from the wider literature, so that ultimately, CMOs were developed that differed substantially from our early work and the explanations of some studies. We initially grouped CMO configurations according to intervention and study type; for example, we separated interventions given to pregnant women from those given only to minority women, and from those studies that used interviews or focus groups to explore the experiences of the advocates. From these small sets we developed candidate essential principles (which together make up our overall theory), each supported and shaped by the CMO configurations. We then clustered our tentative essential principles across interventions and studies to ensure that our final principles were underpinned by mechanisms found across the range of interventions and contexts. This led to revisions of the principles. For example, there were four main initial hypotheses resulting from the studies of professionals, all of which were subsequently modified: how the woman's vulnerabilities affected advocacy success; challenges of the advocacy role/resources for advocacy; features of a good advocate; and organisational and programme support. As articles were able to contribute to multiple principles, we also checked that each principle was based on data from several different papers, to ensure the principles were transferable. </p> <p>Initially we identified 11 essential principles from the literature, which were checked and enriched by the stakeholder group input. This group made the principles more precise, for example in defining terms such as 'vulnerable and marginalised women'. In this review we take the view that marginalisation is both a process and a state. It refers to the relegation to the fringes of society of an individual or group because they cannot access societal rights, resources, and opportunities and so cannot fully participate in social, economic and political life. As such, marginalisation is multi‐layered and complex, being rooted in interconnected economic, social, environmental, and political systems. It leads to greater vulnerability, vulnerable people being broadly considered as individuals or groups with a status that may adversely impact upon their well‐being, which they are unable to adequately protect (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0302" title="WalkerAK , FoxEL . Why marginalization, not vulnerability, can best Identify people in need of special medical and nutrition care. AMA Journal of Ethics2018;20(10):E941‐947.

In: BarrettDH , OrtmannLH , DawsonA , SaenzC , ReisA , BolanG editor(s). Chapter 7: Public Health Ethics: Cases Spanning the Globe. Cham (CH): Springer, 2016. ">Wrigley 2016</a>). All abused women may be considered as marginalised and vulnerable to at least some degree, but in this review we use these interconnected terms to refer to women who are particularly limited in their access to rights, resources and opportunities through their economic, physical, legal, or geographic states. </p> <p>Our stakeholder group also suggested amalgamating some CMOs as different variations of the same concept (e.g. combining economic and physical dependence and also advocacy solutions to these rather than having issues and solutions as two separate principles). This led us to reduce the total to six essential principles. Members of the group all considered the essential principles that focused on women's vulnerabilities to be the most valuable, though they also considered the needs of advocates to be important. They found the essential principles 3 and 6 especially interesting. </p> <p>Below we describe the final essential principles and relevant contributory CMOs developed from the literature, as hypotheses. Constraining contexts and mechanisms are largely the converse of enabling contexts and mechanisms. For example, if there is a lack of joined‐up working between organisations (context) and this leads women and advocates to feel powerless (mechanism), this will be constraining. We have included quotations from participants provided in included articles, or quotations from authors of the articles in some cases, where we feel they demonstrate a particular point clearly and add value to the overall narrative.

Advocacy may reduce the influence of the abuser by shifting the way she feels about him (M1) and increasing her knowledge on how to access resources to reduce her dependency (M2). This may lead to immediate improvement in some outcomes, such as episodes of abuse (O1), but delayed improvement or worsening in others such as mental well‐being ((O2) as an often unanticipated outcome, especially as the woman becomes more aware of her situation), depending on the type of advocacy being offered. </p> <section id="CD013135-sec-0100"> <h6 class="title">1.1.1 Affirming studies of physical dependence</h6> <p>Some confirmation of this has come from the <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0020" title="DePrinceAP , BelknapJ , LabusJS , BuckinghamSE , GoverAR .

The outreach intervention was not specifically designed to reduce physical or economic dependence. Thus, their moderating role on fear could be assessed, using a simple question rated on a five‐point scale for dependences, and the Fear scale of the Trauma Appraisal Questionnaire (TAQ). (The TAQ was developed by <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0184" title="DePrinceAP , ZurbriggenEL , ChuAT , SmartL . Development of the Trauma Appraisal Questionnaire.

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology2012;80(2):211–21. ">DePrince 2012</a> found first that women's greater perceptions of physical dependence on the abuser reduced the odds of total to no engagement with prosecution tasks, court attendance, and prosecution outcomes (B (unstandardised regression coefficient) = −0.62, W (coefficient of concordance) = 7.66, P = 0.006) similarly across treatment groups. In other words, women with greater perceived physical dependence were less likely to follow through with prosecution. Second, women who reported partial or total physical dependence on the abuser showed no clear decrease in fear across groups at follow‐up to 12 months. Dependence appeared to affect fear since those women who reported not being at all physically dependent on the offender showed moderate‐to‐large reductions in fear over time regardless of group (outreach: d (difference between the paired data) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 1.07; referral: d 0.40, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.80). Over time, outreach led to more reduction in fear but this did not reach statistical significance (outreach to referral, baseline to 12 months: d 0.33, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.68). Third, neither condition had an effect on revictimisation by 12 months, but women in the outreach condition reported greater readiness to leave the abuser irrespective of dependencies, showing that these were not the only contextual factors affecting outcomes, and perhaps that over time, outreach had given women more options to choose from. This study suggests that perception of dependence may be as important as actual dependence. This is an important consideration since coercive control aims to disempower women so that they feel a greater dependence on the man than may be necessary. Thus in this regard, advocacy could work not just by removing actual dependence through an increase in potential resources, but through mechanisms that reverse the effects of coercive control itself, such as awareness‐forming and increasing self‐esteem. </p> </section> <section id="CD013135-sec-0101"> <h6 class="title">1.1.2 Affirming studies of economic dependence and immigration status (legal dependence)</h6> <p><a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0095" title="TiwariA , FongDY , WongJY , YuenK‐H , YukH , PangP , et al.

">DePrince 2012</a> explored the relationship between economic dependence and outcomes further, by developing a measure of socioeconomic status (SES) from their existing data through the application of principal component analysis to education, occupation and income variables. SES did not directly affect engagement with prosecution tasks; however, higher SES was associated with a greater likelihood of this outcome being achieved regardless of group. The higher the SES, the lower the odds of having cases dismissed or not filed relative to having a verdict entered (odds ratio (OR) 0.54; B = −0.61, W = 2.54). The study authors suggested that SES may affect engagement through, or in conjunction with, mechanisms such as economic dependence or the severity of the abuse or beliefs about the criminal legal system. Given that their measure included occupation and education however, it may also have been that the women of higher SES had more skills to do research into possible actions, more knowledge about their options and more understanding about the systems they had to navigate (hence increased capabilities) and therefore more options at their disposal.

Resource gains, losses and spirals</h6> <p>According to the COR theory, and our theory based on Sen's capability approach (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0282" title="SenA . Commodities and Capabilities. New York: Elsevier Science, 1985. ">Sen 1985</a>), once a woman has left and extricated herself from her dependencies on the abuser, difficulties associated with a loss of resources ‐ that is problematic outcomes (they have been chosen as the lesser of two evils so we do not call them unwanted) may lead to psychological distress. Resource loss often leads to further resource loss, while gain often results in further gain; this is known as the resource spiral (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0082" title="SullivanCM , GoodmanLA , VirdenT , StromJ , RamirezR . Evaluation of the effects of receiving trauma‐informed practices on domestic violence shelter residents. American Journal of Orthopsychiatry2018;88(5):563‐70. SullivanCM , VirdenT . An eight state study on the relationships among domestic violence shelter services and residents’ self‐efficacy and hopefulness. Journal of Family Violence2017;32:741. ">Sullivan 2018</a>). Resource spirals can be explained by our model drawing on Sen's capability approach. Thus if a person's set of functionings is increased, they may make choices that further add to this set. If their set of functionings is small and their capabilities also, they may be unable to choose options that prevent further resource loss. Given the generative nature of change, spirals not only lead to larger or smaller functioning sets, but different sets with different conversion factors (contexts) and capabilities required and operating. For example a woman who is injured by her abuser after leaving him (a common occurrence as noted by <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0313" title="WilsonM , DalyM . Spousal homicide risk and estrangement. Violence and Victims1993;8(1):3‐16. [8292563] ">Wilson 1993</a>), may not be able to go to work (a loss of a functioning) and therefore she will have a reduced income. Without an income she may not be able to afford to travel to look for more work unless she borrows money. When she borrows money she pays high rates of interest which leads to further loss. Considering the examples in Hypothesis 1.1, a woman with a good set of resources and a large set of functionings ‐ for example a university professor (hence from a higher SES) ‐ when injured by her former abuser may be able to work from home, which increases the time she can spend on researching acceptable ways to end the abuse. She already has the skills to do this research and quickly develops the knowledge, because of her training in research enquiry. She then decides that with this new knowledge she can achieve a functioning not previously open to her, which is to support other abused women. Because of her connections, her knowledge and skills, and her new public‐facing role as an IPV spokesperson she becomes relatively protected from further abuse from her former partner compared with someone with less means and less education. A woman with children and on income support who leaves her abusive partner is likely to find it challenging to re‐enter the job market. She is likely to end up in worse accommodation than when she was with her partner as a result, in a different area, which further reduces the resources at her disposal and hence her choices. </p> <p>Advocacy interventions that improve a woman's capabilities to analyse the trade‐offs of her actions can lead to decisions being made that can reverse her psychological distress and increase well‐being. This is central to the COR theory. For example, turning again to our theory, with COR spirals embedded within, the woman with children and on income support can be supported in accessing employment that includes childcare vouchers or has a workplace nursery or can be supported in joining a housing association and developing community networks. She could then be placed on an upward spiral leading to better mental health and greater well‐being. Therefore, it could be argued that advocacy that focuses on safety plans alone may be insufficient (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0030" title="GoodmanLA , FauciJE , SullivanCM , DiGiovanniCD , WilsonJM .

">Warshaw 2003</a>), especially in communities with few resources, where, for example, stretched funds often mean services limit both what they provide and the number of women they can help. However, according to the COR theory, and our own theory, women may be empowered through being able to use other types of resource, including social support. Once they make changes in these other domains they may develop a well‐being and feelings of empowerment in these other domains that may lead to a gain spiral that ultimately improves their economic resources too. </p> <p>The trick for advocates is to help the women avoid further resource losses, pushing them to a gain spiral rather than a loss spiral.

">Bybee 2005</a>, women who received this advocacy reported less re‐abuse and better social support, effectiveness accessing resources and quality of life. This all agrees with our model. Benefits in effectiveness accessing resources were only found at the two‐year follow‐up (mean difference (MD) −0.18, 95% CI −0.34 to −0.02; n = 265). This is an important point ‐ it takes time to learn new skills and knowledge and develop the mechanisms, such as confidence and self‐efficacy, to use them. In a further paper as part of the same study, the authors reported a cluster‐analysis of findings. This revealed distinct subgroups of survivors (one focused primarily on activities to acquire housing, one concentrated on education and employment, and one focused on legal issues), while cutting across these were high and low activity groups. GLM showed that women who worked with advocates were more effective overall at accessing needed community resources (F‐test value = 42.90, P &lt; 0.001 (exact P value not reported)). Across clusters, women in the control group reported a mean level of effectiveness of 2.71 (SD 0.71), compared with 3.26 (SD 0.57) for women in the advocacy group. This difference held true for all clusters when considered separately, except for the high‐activity cluster. Women in the high‐activity cluster across intervention and control arms perceived themselves as more effective at accessing needed resources than women in the housing cluster (MD 0.52, P &lt; 0.01 (exact P value not reported)). In the terms of our model, women in the high‐activity cluster would be likely to be in a gains spiral. The condition by cluster interaction gave uncertain results, suggesting that the effectiveness of the advocacy was not dependent on the types of needs women initially presented with. This may be partly explained by the fact that although women focused their activities in particular areas, they rarely had needs in only one domain. Women in the low‐activity cluster engaged in fewer strategies to change their lives but felt effective in meeting their needs and benefited from the advocacy. <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0011" title="AllenNE , LarsenS , TrotterJL , SullivanCM .

">Bybee 2005</a> suggested that this may be because some women have fewer needs or are at a different stage of change or come from particular contexts such as an immigrant community or rural area, in which small steps may be more appropriate. This contradicts the perceptions of some advocates that these women are less rewarding or less likely to be helped (see essential principle 5). Considering our model, this suggests that a gains spiral may be built up slowly. This could simply result from small steps being taken that have a smaller incremental effect on functionings choices. However it is possible that these women are also making 'dead‐end' or equilibrium choices, that is choices that satisfy their immediate needs without resulting in either a gain or a loss spiral. This is a concept not considered in COR or Sen's approach more generally. As an example, a woman on income support could simply take advantage of resources to ensure that the welfare and legal help she receives enables her to stay in the same house with her children even though she no longer has her partner's income. She may be happy with this, despite there being no other changes in her life, and may not seek other changes, therefore. Equilibrium could be stable or unstable (<a href="#CD013135-fig-0004">Figure 4</a>). </p> <p>The measure used by <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0011" title="AllenNE , LarsenS , TrotterJL , SullivanCM .

Accessing two to five community resources doubled the odds that abuse had ceased (adjusted OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.07; Wald = 10.57, P &lt; 0.01 (exact P value not reported)) and tripled the odds that a woman felt safer (adjusted OR 3.18, 95% CI 2.11 to 4.81; Wald = 30.18, P &lt; 0.01 (exact P value not reported)).

">Goodman 2016a</a>, in a post‐hoc mediation analysis, found that financial stability and social support fully mediated the negative relationship between survivor‐defined practice and trade‐offs (indirect effects beta −0.04 and −0.09, SE 0.03 and 0.05 respectively, P &lt; 0.05; exact P value not reported). In other words, it is possible that when advocacy helps improve survivors' financial stability and increases their social connections, difficult trade‐offs may be diminished. Therefore these studies further support our theory and suggest mechanisms of women gaining the skills to develop, implement and evaluate a plan for education or find a job, resulting in achieved functionings (i.e. outcomes) of enrolment on courses, or employment. </p> </section> <section id="CD013135-sec-0110"> <h6 class="title">1.2.7 Affirming studies from interventions specifically tackling social support</h6> <p>Six studies included social support components (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0014" title="ConstantinoR , KimY , CranePA .

Women with severe IPV and randomised to the intervention showed a reduced incidence of episodes at postpartum only, compared to the usual‐care group.

H2.1 </p> <p>DM8: If the woman’s informal networks feel overwhelmed /unskilled/unsupported in helping her with her abuse or if they feel constrained by the same cultural or geographical factors as the abused women, they will lack the capabilities to help her. </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>DM8:This leads to the woman becoming even more marginalised and to feelings of learned helplessness and hopelessness and she will feel she has no choice but to maintain the status quo. </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>Enabling mechanisms from advocacy</b> </p> <p>EMfA4: When women migrate from a country with limited services for IPV or when they perceive their new country as a land of opportunity, they will have confidence in the choices made available to them through advocacy and the impact of these services. H2.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA4: This will lead them to use and engage with these services. H2.1</p> <p>EMfA5: When the advocate attends social events with the woman, this boosts the woman’s emotional capital and coping mechanisms. H2.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA5: This improves the woman’s mental health, her well‐being, which gives her the feeling of empowerment to improve other aspects of her life. </p> <p>H2.1</p> <p>EMfA6: When services are nearby, or if means of transportation/childcare are available, and funded, then a woman’s ability to choose to seek help according to her need is strengthened.

H2.1</p> <p>EMfA7: If an abused woman has a social network within the community that allows her to gain access to financial and/or material resources or other support, or if the advocacy provides this, then her ability to choose to seek services according to her need is strengthened.

H2.1</p> <p><b>Disenabling mechanisms</b> </p> <p>DMfA1: If a woman from a patriarchal or closed community seeks advocacy and services are so resource‐constrained that they cannot guarantee her privacy, there may be inadvertent disclosure of her abuse/help‐seeking. H2.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>DMfA1: This will lead to the woman being shamed, embarrassed or humiliated or otherwise condemned by her local community and may also lead to an escalation of the abuse. H2.1 </p> <p>DMfA2:When the woman has children not yet school age and there is no childcare at IPV services, and the woman does not want to talk about the issues in front of her children, or the woman is distracted by them, then the woman’s engagement with advocacy and her development of her capabilities will be reduced. H2.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>DMfA2:This will lead her to use advocacy less, or less effectively and it may also lead her to become disappointed in services. H2.1 </p> <p>DMfA3:If the woman has to take her children to advocacy visits because of a lack of childcare and is afraid the children will reveal her help‐seeking to the abuser, she may become fearful that he will harm her and the children.

This means that effective mechanisms will either need to work within these norms or challenge the structural barriers.

Altogether, 78% of ethnic minority women assigned to the outreach condition went to court whereas only 53% assigned to the referral condition did so. Similarly, in a second paper in the same study, ethnicity was shown to moderate the main effects of condition (outreach or referral) on fear. For women identifying as from ethnic minorities, both outreach and referral were associated with moderate to large reductions in PTSD symptoms, with a slightly greater effect with outreach than referral (though this did not reach statistical significance).

">Thiara 2009</a> considered the introduction of a specialist BAME advocate to Southwark, London, to support women from Bangladeshi and Somali communities to engage with the criminal justice service system, and liaise with agencies to remove structural barriers. She noted that in this case study (with the acronym RSAP), the process of commissioning and funding for these services was fraught with issues, and once the advocates were in place they found it challenging to change the practice of court and other professionals. They spent much time in chasing staff in other services, which required skill and diplomacy. Nonetheless, prosecutors considered they were getting more results with BAME women when they were supported by the RSAP service. This suggests that possibly the efforts of the advocates brought to the fore the issues of the BAME women, so that prosecutors perceived they were getting more results, a perception that may or may not have accorded with reality. <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0086" title="ThiaraRK .

A holistic, tailored approach is needed, which recognises these differences and the implications for mechanisms of change. For example, if a woman's immigration status is resolved, some of the abusive man's control of her can be removed, leading to other changes becoming possible (as per the gain spiral that we have incorporated in our model); a Hispanic woman whose child‐related needs are supported may be freed up to make other changes in her life, while an Asian woman is likely to prioritise other changes. </p> <p>Although the advocacy intervention in the <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0095" title="TiwariA , FongDY , WongJY , YuenK‐H , YukH , PangP , et al.

For example, when an abused woman has a child/children (C1) she may be more engaged with advocacy (O1) if she feels that advocacy will provide her with the capabilities to ensure their safety (M1), or drop out of advocacy (O2) if an advocacy focus on her children leads her to fear that they will be removed from her care (M2), if it is challenging for her to find childcare (M3) or if she is afraid the children will reveal her help‐seeking to the abuser (which may include fear of his harming the children) (M4). Similar mechanisms and outcomes may be expected with pregnant women (C2). However a woman who is pregnant for the first time (C3) may be more likely to attend all advocacy sessions because she does not have to make childcare arrangements (M5) and because the advocacy can be provided within maternity services (M6).

They found that women reporting higher levels of survivor‐defined practice also reported higher levels of safety‐related empowerment; the relationship held after controlling for demographics, financial stability, and social support. Specifically, survivor‐defined practice was associated with two of the three dimensions of safety‐related empowerment: participants' perception that they had the internal resources necessary to move toward safety (3.1% of additional variance explained), and participants' perception that they had access to community support to facilitate safety (6.0% of additional variance explained).

This depended to a large extent on setting. In particular, professional advocates were more likely in a criminal justice setting, whereas advocates from diverse disciplines administered services in other settings. (According to our stakeholder panel, this suggests the need for standardisation of minimum training requirements or competencies.) The context in which an advocate practices ‐ their discipline and setting ‐ will affect the type of advocacy given and approach used (M) and so may have an indirect effect on outcomes (O), but there seemed to be no direct effect of advocate discipline itself (or the disciplines of the authors of included studies) on the effectiveness of advocacy, confirming the idea that the quality of the therapeutic alliance is more important than other contextual factors.

This section considers these needs and requirements principally from the viewpoint of advocates though noting that there is intersection with the women's needs and requirements, as shown in our model. For example, there was evidence that advocates feel that they need time to do the work properly (C1) and that inter‐ and intra‐organisation support (C2) is also important for this, and yet most interventions are designed to be brief and organisational support is often limited, As a result, the advocate is unable to work as effectively as they would like (M), leading to burn‐out and high staff turnover (O). This essential principle is summarised in <a href="#CD013135-tbl-0010">Table 10</a>. Overall, our confidence in the quality of the evidence for this essential principle varied between moderate and high (<a href="#CD013135-tbl-0011">Table 11</a>). </p> <div class="table" id="CD013135-tbl-0010"> <table><a class="open-table-viewer open-in-figure-viewer" href="#0">Open in table viewer</a><div class="table-heading"><span class="table-label">Table 10.</span> <span class="table-title">Essential principle 5: advocates have needs and requirements too in striving for effectiveness</span></div> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>Essential principle 5: advocates have needs and requirements too in striving for effectiveness</b> </p> </td> <td align="left" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="5" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p>Hypothesis 5.1: advocacy takes time to be effective</p> <p>Hypothesis 5.2: economic resources are needed to preserve the consistency and availability of advocacy services </p> <p>Hypothesis 5.3: the personal nature of advocacy work makes it challenging for advocates to know how to manage personal‐professional boundaries safely, which has implications for the well‐being of the advocates and the abused women </p> <p>Hypothesis 5.4: there is a need for advocates to balance competing roles and duties</p> <p>Hypothesis 5.5: advocates take on emotional labour, which needs to be acknowledged</p> <p>Hypothesis 5.6: in it together.

Journal of Interpersonal Violence2013;28(11):2181‐202. ">Wong 2013</a> showed, using linear mixed‐effects analyses, that their advocacy intervention was temporarily effective at reducing depressive symptoms in abused, non‐immigrant women, with a reduction at three months but not at nine months. Given that their social support intervention lasted for 12 weeks, they suggested that this may not be long enough for a sustained effect. Nor was it long enough for any effect on immigrant women. The stress of both abusive relationships and immigration may not be expected to change dramatically in three or even in nine months; however, in the shorter term, events, such as beginning formal help‐seeking, may have led to a temporary abatement of depressive symptoms. An alternative mechanism might be that sharing with and confiding in others gave non‐immigrant women a temporary lift in mood or a feeling of hope but when this did not have any further effect the low mood returned. This would go against the notion of a gain spiral that we have included in our model but we cannot preclude it although other evidence in this section leads us to prefer the explanation of time. For example, immigrant women, as we have discussed in previous sections, are more likely to engage with advocacy over longer periods.

In so doing, the advocate and their work were marked out as different, that is, stigmatised. For example: </p> <p>"I hadn't really noticed anyone or anything that has struck me as a pattern.

But I still think that [he believes] my knowledge comes from my experience and my heart... that it's just me being emotional. And I think a lot of advocates get that. Here's an example. A woman did a training [presentation] on DV and she was a survivor. And she was presenting it, and in a very professional way. But this one guy, apparently, didn't like it. He got up and said, “I've never heard such BS in my life.” And he just wrote her off as an angry victim. And so we get a lot of that.

The "Rewards of working in the job" decreased stress and burnout, and the "Positive aspects of the job" outweighed the negatives and also were negatively associated with burnout. This suggests that self‐balancing strategies may be important in managing burnout in IPV advocates, which fits with Hochschild's model.

(beta = −0.38) was associated with a five‐unit decrease in burnout. Beta scores for hours per week worked and having the tools to do the job were 0.18 and −0.15 respectively, while another variable "Negotiating collaborations with outside agencies" also had a beta score of 0.15 and led to an average 1.25 increase in burnout. <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0008" title="BemillerM , WilliamsLS .

H6.1 </p> <p>EMfA4: when the perpetrator of abuse is cautioned or arrested by the police, this may give the woman trust in the 'strong arm of the law' and the use of force from the police to protect the woman from the perpetrator of her abuse.

Preventing repeat incidents of family violence: a randomized field test of a second responder program in Redlands, CA. Report to the US Dept of Justice2007. ">Davis 2007</a>, this often appeared to have a negative effect. Partners were aware that the home visit occurred in 46% of cases, and in 28% of these the partner had a negative reaction to the visit. In 73% of cases where the victim said that the perpetrator was aware of the home visit, victims reported subsequent physical abuse. In contrast, among cases where victims were sure that the abuser was not aware of the visit, just 5% reported subsequent physical abuse. Therefore, it appears that more frequent reporting means more abuse, rather than greater sensitisation to abuse. Thus, in this case, the intervention had a serious unwanted effect; however, it could also mean that victims who were having trouble with their partner were more likely to use the visit as a means of discouraging him from committing new abuse. Among six cases where victims said that the perpetrator was home during the second response, none reported new abuse of any kind. <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0030" title="GoodmanLA , FauciJE , SullivanCM , DiGiovanniCD , WilsonJM .

That space is constrained or expanded by context which is represented by the individual, local and structural conversion factors in our figure. We have chosen to use the term conversion factor in the model to highlight the effect of context on mechanisms. Our provisional model highlights the complex way that factors combine and interact for effective advocacy. </p> <p>At the individual level, access to and control over resources is a significant feature of the theory. CMOs in the literature highlight three key resources, which are explored within our essential principles. These are: financial resources (essential principle 1, essential principle 6), social resources (essential principles 1 to 6), and knowledge, awareness and information (which also cuts across essential principles). To these we add emotional resources and legal resources (essential principles 1 and 2). We have shown how it is insufficient to simply provide access to these resources; women also need the capabilities to use them. The social position of women influences their capabilities space, for example women of higher SES may have greater capabilities to use resources even without advocacy, while undocumented migrants may have particularly limited capabilities and may also fear or distrust officials and providers. The severity and type of abuse experienced also affects women's capabilities space. </p> <p>We have also shown how the generative nature of change applies in the context of advocacy for abused women. In other words, actions lead to changes in actual functionings but also the capabilities and conversion factors required for further action. A change in one conversion factor can lead to a change in capabilities and through this, further action that again leads to a change in another conversion factor and in capabilities. The concept of spirals of gains and losses relates to this and it is critical to understand this when considering the longer‐term effectiveness of advocacy. It means that the woman's situation is dynamic – the new change in conversion factors may be a setback for the woman (and may be something that is not easy to change directly through advocacy) or it may be a positive effect. Negative effects may beget other negative effects through the generative nature of change, and positive effects may beget further positive effects. This dynamism means that unanticipated as well as anticipated outcomes may result from advocacy. </p> <p>For example, economic and social dependence on the abuser may affect whether or not a woman has children early (essential principle 3), and this may then feed back into levels of dependency in a circle of effect. This is demonstrated by the feedback arrows as well as the gain and loss spirals in our model. The complexity of the situation is highlighted by the evidence concerning women's vulnerabilities and intersectionalities and the trade‐offs that must be considered in advocacy‐related decisions in the contexts of the individual women's lives (essential principle 2). It is also shown in the evidence that women may be hopeful about the impact of advocacy in the short term and not realise the longer‐term issues of any change (essential principle 6). </p> <p>At the local (community) level, we have shown how communities may affect abused women's use of advocacy (essential principle 1, essential principle 2, essential principle 6). We consider communities as geographically and culturally defined, each differently characterised by the availability of facilities or resources and prevailing social norms and values that can support or constrain abused women, advocacy and advocates. We have also considered how members of the woman's social networks may assume an advocacy role by placing them explicitly within our theory figure (<a href="#CD013135-fig-0003">Figure 3</a>). In addition, we have explored how advocates belong to different professionally and physically defined communities of practice, such as legal advocates within a courthouse, or healthcare clinic advocacy separated from other services (essential principles 2, 5 and 6). Within each setting the human and economic resources, ways of working, structural and organisational contexts, existence and type of training or guidance, and linking to other organisations all influence the advocates' and abused women's capabilities space (essential principles 5 and 6). Significant challenges for advocates were identified in inter‐organisational working, vicarious traumatisation, and lack of clarity on how much support to give a woman, given the individualised approach (essential principles 5 and 6). Social interactions between the woman and the advocate – the therapeutic alliance – also influence this (essential principle 4). </p> <p>At the structural level, the key conversion factor is funding, with policy also being important. We have shown how women who are marginalised and made particularly vulnerable to abuse by their dependencies or geographies, which act as barriers to an extension of their capabilities spaces and hence resource use, are affected at all three levels of our model and how the structural level may be especially challenging for advocates to manage. </p> <p>The spirals in <a href="#CD013135-fig-0003">Figure 3</a> show the interconnectedness of influences on women's/advocate's capabilities space. The two phases of equilibrium (stable and unstable) may alternate over time – demonstrating the key significance of time to the development of the capabilities space. </p> <p>Our panel considered our most important principle to be that advocacy work must take into account the influence of the abuser on the woman, as it may lead the woman to tolerate his abuse and coercive control if the trade‐offs of the alternatives are perceived by the woman as worse. Our second most important principle according to our panel highlighted the importance of developing holistic, tailored advocacy intervention plans that recognise the individual risks and needs of vulnerable and marginalised women such as those from minority groups or from rural areas. It is possible that this should include consideration of whether an abused woman was pregnant or had children. More broadly, according to our findings, more effective advocacy was likely when: </p> <p> <ul id="CD013135-list-0047"> <li> <p>having a ‘one‐stop' person (a dedicated advocate for each woman) to turn to for advice and information (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0015" title="CoyM , KellyL .

Thus, our review shows that the direction of the relationship depends on which outcomes are being considered. For example, a woman living with her abuser could engage more with court action but could be more depressed. This means that advocacy could potentially always have some benefits for an abused woman if it is undertaken for long enough, but that the goals of the advocacy need to match the woman's needs rather than those the advocate might see as preferable. </p> <p>Our review has also shown that the focus should not be solely on the interventions themselves, but should encompass the interaction between advocates and the women they are supporting, and the support needs and requirements of advocates. The therapeutic alliance was repeatedly demonstrated in studies to be important for woman/survivor‐centred care. However, with the focus of this care on valuing what was important in the lives of the women themselves, and on trust and empathy, advocates often found it difficult to separate the professional from the personal. In particular, they were concerned to not cross boundaries in ways that were potentially harmful to themselves or to the women, and they found it challenging to balance competing roles and duties such as encouraging women to take control of their lives whilst minimising the risks. It was clear from our review that being an advocate is not easy, and this can have an impact on effectiveness too. Advocate burnout and a hardening of attitude could attenuate a survivor‐centred approach or reduce the capacity of the advocate to take on work, especially if the advocate was a survivor of abuse herself; though being a survivor (or of matched ethnicity) conversely improved the therapeutic alliance. Solving some challenges, such as support for marginalised women, and with additional resources for this, could therefore help both advocates and abused women. Advocates also valued training, protocols for difficult situations, debriefs, and peer and organisational support. This was true of advocates from IPV agencies as much as from other organisations; there was no clear effect of discipline of the advocate on advocacy success. </p> <p>Advocates often felt ineffective when they only managed brief contact with the woman because of organisational failures or because the woman stopped seeking help or returned to her abuser. One or two contacts with a woman were viewed as never sufficient for empowerment, though they may change safety behaviours. Although brief intensive advocacy was often effective, the evidence suggests that a longer time is needed within advocacy for women experiencing more severe abuse. Nonetheless, women experiencing more severe abuse and women from vulnerable and marginalised groups with few resources at the start of advocacy may show greater benefits in some outcomes in the short term. These benefits indicate a low starting point rather than a ‘good outcome'. Smaller changes than expected in other outcomes may mean the women have fewer needs, are at an early 'stage of change' or come from particular contexts (such as an immigrant community or rural area) in which small steps may be more appropriate. Moreover, we have provided some evidence that the outcomes evaluated in studies of interventions are driven by theoretical considerations of empowerment and may not represent women's views of a good outcome. It is noteworthy that there were few studies exploring this with the women themselves in relation to advocacy. However, it is encouraging that marginalised women are more likely to remain engaged with services. </p> <p>We also found that the setting for the advocacy affected the theoretical underpinnings and the type and focus of the advocacy being offered and the women's possible responses (as constrained by the types of services offered), and that this, in turn, drove the decision in studies as to which outcomes to evaluate.

Terms of empowerment/exemplars of prevention: toward a theory for community psychology. American Journal of Community Psychology1987;15:121‐48. ">Rappaport 1987</a>). What this means may differ with context. For example, it may lead some women to leave their abuser whereas ethnic minority women with issues such as immigration status and cultural and economic dependencies may need to become empowered to reject options presented by services with limited cultural humility. It was often unclear whether researchers were considering empowerment as a process, an outcome, or both.

Hence, advocacy interventions that help the woman to access resources and balance resource losses or at least prevent further resource loss, should lead to better mental health and well‐being, while a co‐ordinated community response should be more effective. This is broadly indicated by the evidence, though we did not explore co‐ordinated community responses, and there are particular issues for very low‐income women.

">Prosman 2014</a> suggested structural factors that reduced women's access to resources, especially in the case of vulnerable and marginalised women, led to a "learned helplessness". Their arguments imply that an empowerment‐based intervention may have its effect partly by increasing the women's confidence and reducing their learned helplessness irrespective of resource provision. Overall, the evidence supports the idea that there are several active ingredients of advocacy, and that advocacy based on empowerment has the potential to affect diverse outcomes, benefiting abused women in a number of ways. We used the CMOs we developed to produce a tentative logic model of advocacy interventions for abused women (see <a href="./appendices#CD013135-sec-0199">Appendix 5</a>), which differs from that presented in <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0274" title="RivasC , RamsayJ , SadowskiL , DavidsonLL , DunneD , EldridgeS , et al.

We also developed a theory unifying the different CMOs and essential principles in a way that can be easily understood by practitioners and researchers (see <a href="./appendices#CD013135-sec-0199">Appendix 5</a>). </p> <p>Nonetheless, despite finding clear CMO patterns in the data, there are gaps in the evidence. There is a lack of clarity as to how different components of an intervention may interact. We started with the premise that a multi‐component intervention that added elements to the core features of advocacy, perhaps including psychotherapy, might be more effective than an advocacy‐only intervention, but could find no support for this from the evidence. This may be because of the woman‐focused (individually tailored) nature of the interventions, such that elements were added to the core advocacy features depending on need and setting. This flexibility, and also the increased use of co‐ordinated responses in which different agencies work together, make it challenging to be certain of the impact of advocacy itself isolated from other interventions though our study has shown how advocacy itself may work in different contexts and for whom. <a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0059" title="McFarlaneJ , SoekenK , WiistW .

">Shorey 2014</a> lament the dearth of research on the interaction between different elements of multi‐component interventions that include advocacy, though they suggest that better understanding of the different components themselves may be the priority. Further complicating understandings, 10 interview, survey and intervention studies have considered women in a shelter environment and none tried to determine from them their functioning beforehand. Just being in a shelter may have led to improvements even before advocacy, and leaving the safety of the shelter may lead to trade‐offs that are not considered in studies. There is a lack of clarity concerning what improvements in outcomes might occur even without advocacy and how this might affect advocacy, given the generative nature of change. Several studies noted that some outcomes improved with time regardless of whether or not the woman received an intervention. This suggests that single‐subject research designs could be usefully employed to test the time component of our model by determining between‐condition differences in effect size in subgroups of women (<a href="./references#CD013135-bbs2-0285" title="SmithJD . Single‐case experimental designs: a systematic review of published research and current standards. Psychological Methods2012;17(4):510‐50. ">Smith 2012</a>).

In contrast to an effectiveness systematic review, a realist review aims to build an understanding of why and how things work and for whom, rather than providing a comprehensive synthesis of the literature. Therefore, we did not include papers that provided minimal information on the factors of interest to our theory building, even if they were associated with papers that were included, and searches in phase 2 of our strategy were intended to be explanatory. Whilst a realist review does not require a comprehensive search, the availability of data made a quasi‐comprehensive approach feasible for us. The realist methodology allowed much broader engagement with the theory underlying advocacy interventions for women experiencing IPV. Our review has drawn from a diverse literature, including both grey literature and peer‐reviewed papers, and has been supplemented by insights from the reference panel. There were gaps within the literature; for example, there were insufficient data for an economic consideration or evidence capturing more distal outcomes, or the effects of demographic variables such as the age of abused women or the expertise of advocates. Most studies in this review are from urban settings. It is unclear what impact this has had on the overall completeness of the evidence; the rich studies on rural settings that were included suggest more intervention studies should compare settings as a factor. We also excluded any article for which both child abuse and adult abuse had been assigned as keywords from the MEDLINE search to ensure a single focus on adult abuse only, on the basis of results from a scoping search but did not so implement this for other database searches. Despite the gaps and limitations, this review has provided some clear indications of the mechanisms and contexts/conversion factors for effectiveness in advocacy for abused women.

H1.1 </p> <p>or</p> <p>When the woman does not live with her abuser, she is more easily able to evade him to seek help and to hide her help‐seeking from him, which gives her a wider set of choices available to her to end or reduce the abuse and seek help from services according to her need. H1.3 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> <br/> EM1: this leads to the woman’s seeking appropriate help from services. H1.1 </p> <p><b>Disenabling mechanisms</b> </p> <p>DM1: if an abused woman is physically/legally/economically dependent on her abuser and has limited resources with which to provide for herself or support herself without her abuser, then her ability to choose to end or reduce the abuse and seek help from services according to her need is limited, and she will fear the potential loss of her home and the close ties with family and friends, even though she may have high expectations of the helpfulness of services for her without these constraints. H1.1 and H1.2 </p> <p>or</p> <p>DM2: if an abused woman is emotionally dependent on her abuser because the coercive control has lowered her perceptions of her own value and capabilities, she will perceive her ability to choose to begin and to sustain changes to the relationship (e.g. to end or reduce the abuse) and/or seek help from services as limited and will fear the potential loss of her home and the close ties with family and friends. H1.1 and H1.2 </p> <p>or</p> <p>DM3: if an abused woman is experiencing moderate to severe physical or sexual abuse from her abuser, she will have a limited set of options to end or reduce the abuse and/or seek help from services and will fear retribution from her abuser if she does so. H1.3 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> <br/> DM1, DM2 and DM3: in all 3 cases, this leads her to delay/avoid seeking help, and to put up with her situation and adopt a wait‐and‐see position with respect to its evolution and to develop unfavourable psychosocial and psychological responses to the abuse (e.g. depression). H1.1, H1.2 and H1.3 </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>Enabling mechanisms from advocacy</b> </p> <p>EMfA1: if the advocacy increases the woman’s capabilities to use resources (from a clearer understanding of what support is available to her that is suitable for her needs/dependencies, and help in accessing this), then her ability to choose to end or reduce the abuse and seek help from services according to her need will increase. H1.1 and H1.2 </p> <p>or</p> <p>EMfA2: if the advocacy increases the woman’s self‐esteem and self‐efficacy and develops in her the confidence in her ability to begin and to safely sustain changes to the relationship and/or seek help from services and/or improve her circumstances. H1.1 and H1.2. If the advocacy increases the woman’s self‐esteem and self‐efficacy and develops her confidence in herself, then there will be an increase in her self‐perceived and actual ability to begin and to safely sustain changes to the relationship and/or seek help from services and/or improve her circumstances. H1.1 and H1.2 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> <br/> EMfA1 and EMfA2<i>:</i> in both cases, this leads to the woman’s decreased fear of the consequences of ending the relationship/limiting the abuse and reduction in her learned helplessness (including deeply held beliefs and values that may be culturally shaped) and leads her to take steps to make the changes, which may include seeking help from services. </p> <p>EMfA3: if the advocacy shifts an abused woman’s understandings and perceptions of her emotional dependencies and commitment /investment in the abusive relationship, through education on abuse and healthy relationships, and awareness and assessment of her risks from the abuse, underlying reasons for and triggers of abuse and the way the man controls her through her dependences, then her perceptions of her need to take safety precautions and make use of services will be changed. H1.1 and H1.2 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i><br/> EMfA3: this leads to the woman’s increased use of safety behaviours and the development of a safety plan, which may include seeking help from services. H1.1 and H1.2 </p> <p>EMfA4: if the advocacy shifts an abused woman’s goals and priorities about her life and the abusive relationship, through education on abuse and healthy relationships, awareness and assessment of her risks from the abuse, an improved/restored self‐identity and the capacity to balance risks and benefits of different choices, she will </p> <p>fear the consequences of continued abuse more than any reduction in circumstances. H1.2 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> <br/> EMfA4: This leads to the woman’s decreased fear of the consequences of ending the relationship/limiting the abuse and she takes steps to do so, which may include seeking help from services and developing personal action, implementation and evaluation goals/plans. H1.2 </p> <p>EMfA5: If an abused woman is experiencing moderate to severe physical or sexual abuse from her abuser, and she is supported in understanding the risks to herself and the choice set of options available to her to change the relationship then her perceptions of her need to take safety precautions and make use of services and her fear of the abuser will be heightened. H1.3 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA5:This leads to her active and engaged help‐seeking to reduce the risks to herself from the abuse whilst also minimising the effects of retribution from the man. H1.3 </p> <p>EMfA6:If the advocate educates the community about IPV and about available services for survivors, this increases the capabilities of the community and the woman’s informal network to be supportive to the woman. H1.2 </p> <p>or</p> <p>EMfA6:If the advocate provides emotional support for members of the woman’s social networks who are themselves emotionally affected by the woman’s abuse, this increases their capabilities regarding abuse. H1.2 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA6:This leads to an increase in local informal network support for the woman and the woman’s social capital, which decreases her anxiety and depression, PTSD symptoms and suicide attempts (as responses to the abuse) and benefits her well‐being. H1.2 </p> <p>EMfA7:When a woman is provided with social support by advocacy and her well‐being improves as a result, she will feel more hopeful and confident in developing her capabilities to make changes to her situation. H1.2 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA7:This leads to her making active improvements in her situation in a spiral of positive gains. H1.2 </p> <p>EMfA8:When an advocate develops knowledge or awareness of cultural humility through exposure to relevant groups or training she will realise that leaving the relationship is not necessarily the best option for a woman. </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA8:This leads to her exploring with the woman in a woman‐focused way what options the woman prefers and she no longer pressures the woman to leave the relationship. H1.2 </p> <p>EMfA9:If an advocate helps the woman to develop the capabilities to look for work or education, then the woman will view her future outside of the abusive relationship more positively. H1.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA9:This will give her the confidence and the motivation to enrol on a course or gain employment. H1.1 </p> <p><b>Disenabling mechanisms from advocacy</b> </p> <p>DMfA1: if the woman reduces her dependencies on the abuser, the man will feel that his male status (e.g. as a provider) is threatened.

H1.1 and H1.2 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i><br/> DM4: This will lead her to develop a learned helplessness about her situation and a lack of confidence in any services as being able to help her and so she will not seek help.

H1.1 and H1.2 </p> <p>or</p> <p>DM6: If an abused woman, through geography, is marginalised in the employment market, locked out of the inheritance structure and limited in their education or careers because of family or community responsibilities, and has limited resources with which to provide for herself or support herself without her abuser, then her ability to choose to end or reduce the abuse and seek help from services or her community according to her need is limited, and she will fear the potential loss of her home and community.

H1.1 and H1.2 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i><br/> EMfA10: this leads to the woman’s increased confidence in involving these services and she takes steps to do so. H1.1 and H1.2 </p> <p>EMfA11: if an advocate educates an abused woman about healthy social relationships (not just intimate relationships) the woman develops new ‘templates’ for thinking about informal network relationships that may help her.

H1.3 </p> <p>DMfA3: if the advocate does not manage the woman’s (high or low) expectations of what advocacy can achieve, and the woman’s capabilities do not increase as quickly as she anticipates (or at all), or structural or local barriers are not removed to the access to or use of services, her choices will continue to be constrained. </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>DMfA3: this will lead her to abandon the advocacy or to have reinforcement of her learned helplessness (if developed from previous service encounters and from the coercive control). </p> <p>DMfA4: When an advocate has to deal with poor infrastructure, limited services and local social patriarchal attitudes her choices of what she can do for the woman are constrained.

H6.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA1: this may lead her to begin to reflect on the seriousness of her situation and the need to change it. H6.1 </p> <p>EMfA2: when a woman goes to a shelter, she is likely to have experienced abuse severe enough to induce her to leave home. H6.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA2: this may make her receptive to interventions of long duration, such as finding housing. H6.1 </p> <p>EMfA3: when police officers accompanied by an advocate make unannounced home visits this may give the woman confidence in the police. H6.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA3: this may lead to the woman contacting the police more often about abusive episodes. H6.1 </p> <p>EMfA4: when the perpetrator of abuse is cautioned or arrested by the police, this may give the woman trust in the 'strong arm of the law' and the use of force from the police to protect the woman from the perpetrator of her abuse. H6.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA4: this may lead to the woman contacting the police more often about abusive episodes. H6.1 </p> <p>EMfA5: if advocates make clear to women that they are independent of the police the women are more likely to trust them. H6.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> <br/> EMfA5: this leads to more use of advocacy for judicial support. H6.1 </p> <p>EMfA6: when an advocate is located in a formal setting, credibility by association is conferred on the advocate. H6.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>EMfA6: this leads the woman to trust the competency of the advocate and make use of their services. H6.1 </p> <p>EMfA7: when services are rural, they have to deliver services well beyond their mandate and stretch their resources.

H6.2 </p> <p><b>Disenabling mechanisms from advocacy</b> </p> <p>DMfA1: when a woman is invited to advocacy in non‐critical healthcare settings (antenatal care, mother and child clinics, primary care or public health) from which she has not sought help for abuse, there may be a mismatch between what she is offered and her stage of change. H6.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>DMfA1: this leads her to reject the advocacy. H6.1</p> <p>DMfA2: when police officers accompanied by an advocate make unannounced home visits the perpetrator of abuse may not be aware of police involvement or may resent it. H6.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>DMfA2: this may antagonise the perpetrator of the abuse and lead to the woman’s safety being compromised and her diminished use of the police. H6.1 </p> <p>DMfA3: unsolicited help may represent an often unwanted intrusion into the lives of the women that intersects negatively with broader societal structures. H6.1 </p> <p><i>Consequences</i> </p> <p>DMfA3: this may lead the woman to have problems with her local community or with social services or to perceive that she might have. H6.1 </p> <p>DMfA4: when an advocate has to deal with poor infrastructure, limited services and local social patriarchal attitudes her choices of what she can do for the woman are constrained.
