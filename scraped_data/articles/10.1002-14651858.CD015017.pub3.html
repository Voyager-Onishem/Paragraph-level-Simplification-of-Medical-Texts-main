The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) replication in early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on ivermectin for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 treatment is conflicting. </p> </section> <section id="CD015017-sec-0002"> <h3 class="title" id="CD015017-sec-0002">Objectives</h3> <p>To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID‐19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 (postexposure prophylaxis). </p> </section> <section id="CD015017-sec-0003"> <h3 class="title" id="CD015017-sec-0003">Search methods</h3> <p>We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and HTA database weekly to identify completed and ongoing trials without language restrictions to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with &gt; 1000 participants up to April 2022. </p> </section> <section id="CD015017-sec-0004"> <h3 class="title" id="CD015017-sec-0004">Selection criteria</h3> <p>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Co‐interventions had to be the same in both study arms. </p> <p>For this review update, we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity: only RCTs prospectively registered in a trial registry according to WHO guidelines for clinical trial registration were eligible for inclusion. </p> </section> <section id="CD015017-sec-0005"> <h3 class="title" id="CD015017-sec-0005">Data collection and analysis</h3> <p>We assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for outcomes in the following settings and populations: 1) to treat inpatients with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19, 2) to treat outpatients with mild COVID‐19 (outcomes: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, (serious) adverse events, quality of life, and viral clearance), and 3) to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (outcomes: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, development of COVID‐19 symptoms, admission to hospital, mortality, adverse events and quality of life). </p> </section> <section id="CD015017-sec-0006"> <h3 class="title" id="CD015017-sec-0006">Main results</h3> <p>We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review version; six were not prospectively registered and one was non‐randomized. This updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention of infection or compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated participants with moderate COVID‐19 (inpatient settings); six treated mild COVID‐19 (outpatient settings). Eight trials were double‐blind and placebo‐controlled, and three were open‐label. We assessed around 50% of the trial results as low risk of bias. </p> <p>We identified 31 ongoing trials. In addition, there are 28 potentially eligible trials without publication of results, or with disparities in the reporting of the methods and results, held in ‘awaiting classification’ until the trial authors clarify questions upon request. </p> <p><b>Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in inpatient settings with moderate‐to‐severe disease</b> </p> <p>We are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo reduces or increases all‐cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or clinical worsening, assessed by participants with new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death at day 28 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or serious adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may have little or no effect on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants discharged alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at 7 days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No trial investigated quality of life at any time point. </p> <p><b>Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease</b> </p> <p>Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life, measured with the PROMIS Global‐10 scale (physical component mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.98 to 0.98; and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐1.08 to 1.08; 1358 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening, assessed by admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants with all initial symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at day 7 compared to placebo(RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Based on the very low‐certainty evidence for inpatients, we are still uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while there is low‐certainty evidence that it has no beneficial effect regarding clinical improvement, viral clearance and adverse events. No evidence is available on ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In this update, certainty of evidence increased through higher quality trials including more participants.

The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited. </p> <p>Evaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available. </p> <p><b>What is ivermectin?</b> </p> <p>Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects. </p> <p>Medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID‐19.</p> <p><b>What did we want to find out?</b> </p> <p>We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID‐19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID‐19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID‐19 is uncertain. </p> <p>We evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on:</p> <p>– people dying;<br/>– whether people's COVID‐19 got better or worse;<br/>– quality of life;<br/>– serious and non‐serious unwanted effects;<br/>– viral clearance. </p> <p>For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. </p> <p><b>What did we do?</b> </p> <p>We searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID‐19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19. </p> <p>In this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria. </p> <p>We compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. </p> <p><b>What did we find?</b> </p> <p>We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo. </p> <p>For treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID‐19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID‐19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment. </p> <p>No trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.</p> <p>We also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published. </p> <p><b>Main results</b> </p> <p><b>Treating people in hospital with COVID‐19</b> </p> <p>We do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment: </p> <p>– leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people); <br/>– worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people);<br/>– increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people). </p> <p>Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: </p> <p>– improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people);<br/>– non‐serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants). </p> <p>Seven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID‐19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care. </p> <p><b>Treating outpatients with COVID‐19</b> </p> <p>Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people). </p> <p>Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people). </p> <p>Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: </p> <p>– worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people);<br/>– serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people); <br/>– non‐serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants); <br/>– improving people's COVID‐19 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people);<br/>– number of people with negative COVID‐19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people). </p> <p><b>What are the limitations of the evidence?</b> </p> <p>Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high‐quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes. </p> <p><b>How up to date is this evidence?</b> </p> <p>The systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021.

The same accounts with low‐certainty evidence for all other outpatient outcomes and clinical improvement, viral clearance, and adverse events in the inpatient setting. Based on the current very low‐certainty evidence, we are still uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or worsening of clinical status or increases serious adverse events in inpatients. No evidence is available on ivermectin to prevent a SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in people after having high‐risk exposure. Overall, the reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 outside well‐designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). With respect to the number of identified trials in trial registries and with accordance to the living approach of this review, we will continually update our search and include eligible trials. </p> </section> <h3 class="title" id="CD015017-sec-0101">Implications for research</h3> <section id="CD015017-sec-0101"> <p>There remains insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of ivermectin used for the treatment of people with COVID‐19 in the inpatient and outpatient settings.

Any potential antiviral and anti‐inflammatory effect could have a greater influence on the disease at that early stage of viral replication. For the same reason, we do not define the missing data on severe disease, which are considered as long‐term infections, as an evidence gap. </p> <p>Regarding the large amount of trials that have been or should have been completed in the past, we appeal to trialists to indicate recruitment status of trials in their respective registry entry and share data transparently as soon as possible, e.g. via preprint servers, in order to make all findings on ivermectin available for the public and prevent publication bias. Currently, there is still an urgent need for good‐quality evidence, based on RCTs with appropriate randomization procedures, comparability of trial arms, and preferably a double‐blind design. However, the potential amount of data already, and soon to be available from completed and ongoing RCTs, may close the evidence gap without more new trials being launched. We are currently trying to contact investigators of those trials, encouraging them to make their data publicly available. </p> <p>In accordance with the living approach of this review, we will continually update our search and include eligible trials. </p> <p>Problematic trials may distort evidence synthesis. For this review update, we developed a tool to help us identify trials that are potentially problematic regarding aspects of research integrity. We believe that this tool, which consists of six domains to assess research integrity of RCTs included in systematic reviews, is a new transparent option to consider the concept of research integrity in evidence synthesis and will serve as a platform for urgent developments in this direction. </p> </section> </section> </section> <section class="summaryOfFindings"> <div class="section-header

A ‘problematic study’ is defined by Cochrane as "Any published or unpublished study where there are serious questions about the trustworthiness of the data or findings, regardless of whether the study has been formally retracted; scientific misconduct will not be the only reason that a study might be problematic; problems may result from poor research practices or honest errors" (<a href="./references#CD015017-bbs2-0137" title="Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews: editorial policies.

To respond to these facts and developments, we changed the inclusion criteria for this review update to identify and handle problematic trials, and considered research integrity of the individual trial as an important eligibility criteria. Current standard tools for systematic reviews do not systematically consider issues of research integrity. However, there are useful tools available, such as the REAPPRAISED checklist for evaluation of publication integrity (<a href="./references#CD015017-bbs2-0157" title="GreyA , BollandMJ , AvenellA , KleinAA , GunsalusCK .

Briefly, trials were only eligible for the current review update if they met critical aspects assuring research integrity, such as retraction notices, prospective trial registration, ethics approval, plausible study authorship, sufficient reporting of methods regarding relevant eligibility criteria (e.g. randomization), and plausibility of study results.

Thus, we evaluated 570 records overall. The 22 records we had identified by hand search in the previous review, appeared in searched databases by the time of this updated search, and could be deduplicated. After removing duplicates, 382 records remained. During title and abstract screening, we judged 200 records as irrelevant as they did not meet the prespecified inclusion criteria. We proceeded to full‐text screening with 182 records, of which 39 records were newly identified in the updated search and 143 records that had already been screened in the previous review version had to be reassessed for eligibility. The re‐evaluation was necessary because the research integrity assessment was introduced as a new eligibility criteria for trials, and additionally, previously ongoing trials had to be reassessed if new information had become available in the meantime. Decisions from the original review version that were changed due to assessment of the trials’ research integrity can be found in <a href="#CD015017-tbl-0003">Table 1</a>. We considered published full texts in journals or on preprint servers or, if these were unavailable, entries in trial registers. We excluded 55 trials (84 records) with reasons after full‐text assessment. We identified 31 ongoing trials (37 records) and 28 trials (30 records) awaiting assessment. In February 2022 we set the deadline for inclusion of newly‐published trial results for this review update. Hence, after initially closing the trial pool for this review update, we identified one trial with more than 1000 participants, previously classified as ongoing, that published its results in March 2022. We included this trial in the review without an additional systematic search, resulting in 11 trials (32 records) that met our eligibility criteria and enabled us to perform qualitative syntheses and meta‐analyses (quantitative syntheses).

We excluded 7 of the 14 trials included in the previous review version; six were not prospectively registered and one turned out to be non‐randomized. Four trials of the updated search passed the research integrity assessment and were eligible for this review. Finally, this review included 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo. Investigating treatment of COVID‐19, five trials were conducted in inpatient settings with moderate COVID‐19 (WHO 4 to 5) only and six trials in outpatient settings with mild COVID‐19 (WHO 1 to 3). No trial investigated ivermectin for the prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The included trials contributed 44 trial results to the review, about one‐half of which we assessed as having some concerns or high risk of bias. The main findings of this review are summarized in <a href="./full#CD015017-tbl-0001">summary of findings Table 1</a> (treatment; inpatients) and <a href="./full#CD015017-tbl-0002">summary of findings Table 2</a> (treatment; outpatients). The number of trials per outcome increased compared to the previous review version, especially in the outpatient setting. For the inpatient setting though, there were still no more than three trials per outcome providing useful data for our updated outcome set. </p> <p>Ivermectin showed no evidence of an effect on increasing or decreasing mortality at 28 days, the most important outcome during this pandemic, neither in inpatients (3 trials) nor outpatients (6 trials). The certainty of evidence for this finding was very low and moderate, respectively. Since the last review, the certainty of evidence increased for mortality in outpatients from very low to moderate. </p> <p>For all other outcomes relevant for inpatients with moderate disease, such as risk of clinical worsening, being discharged alive, adverse or serious adverse events, and viral clearance, ivermectin showed no evidence of an effect, neither for improving nor worsening the respective outcome. The certainty of evidence for those findings varied from very low to low. Compared to the previous review version, certainty of evidence for any adverse events and viral clearance at day 7 in the inpatient setting increased from very low to low in this update. </p> <p>For the outpatient setting, the relevant outcome of admission to hospital or death as well as quality of life, that were not reported by any trial in the previous review version, could be evaluated in this update. Overall, for all the outcomes relevant for outpatients with mild disease, such as risk of needing hospitalization, resolving symptoms, adverse or serious adverse events and viral clearance, ivermectin showed no evidence of an effect neither for improving nor worsening the respective outcome. The certainty of evidence for all of those findings was low. With high certainty, we found that ivermectin showed no effect on quality of life for the outpatient setting. </p> <p>No trial investigated ivermectin for the prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Hence, no evidence could be found for postexposure prophylaxis in this matter. </p> </section> <section id="CD015017-sec-0095"> <h3 class="title" id="CD015017-sec-0095">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</h3> <p>First, with the new outcome set in this update, we mainly addressed the issue of competing outcome risk. We combined outcomes that represent clinical worsening with the outcome of death which would allow evidence on ivermectin to become more unambiguous and patient‐relevant. </p> <p>Four newly‐included trials for the outpatient setting increased certainty of evidence on ivermectin for this purpose compared to the previous review version. Overall, the included trials investigated participants with COVID‐19 at WHO 1 to 3 and WHO 4 to 5. Therefore, findings of this review are transferable to patients with COVID‐19 at mild to moderate stages. In this update, no trials investigated ivermectin for severe COVID‐19 (WHO 6 to 9). Considering the proposed mode of action, no effect of the drug would be expected if given at such a late stage of the disease. Hence, we do not consider this to be an evidence gap that needs to be closed. Moreover, with few exceptions, most included trials reported treatment initiation within a mean of 5 days after symptom onset, which is in line with the propagated hypothesis of ivermectin's inhibitory effect on virus replication in early stages of the disease. </p> <p>In contrast to the hype around ivermectin's potential to prevent a SARS‐CoV‐2 infection after high‐risk contact, no RCT investigating this purpose has been published since the previous review version. Most trials were conducted before any form of vaccination was available, leading to 93% of participants across trials knowingly not being vaccinated. Therefore, we could not assess the influence of vaccination status in this review update. Equally, we could not identify any evidence on the effect of ivermectin on the newly‐emerging Omicron variant. </p> <p>Overall, most trials reported a mean age far below 60 years (overall mean age was 45 years with a mean range from 28 to 63 years). Additionally, in the inpatient setting, trials included people with few or no comorbidities. Considering age and pre‐existing conditions as the most important risk factors for developing severe COVID‐19 and complications from the disease, the current evidence for inpatients is not applicable to patients who are at most risk of suffering COVID‐19 with serious consequences such as death or need for mechanical ventilation. In the outpatient setting, applicability of the evidence improved compared to the previous review version, since three of six trials included large proportions of participants with comorbidites, such as obesity and hypertension. </p> <p>COVID‐19 vaccinations provide the most reliable and safest protection against the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus and progression to severe disease, however due to global inequity, not every region of the world has unlimited access to vaccinations. Therefore, it is to be expected that countries with low and middle healthcare expenditure, focus research efforts on repurposing of drugs. Accordingly, six trials were conducted in Latin America, three in Asia, and only two in Europe.

Five of the 11 trials used low doses in at least one trial arm. All other trials utilized higher doses, either in a single dose or over 2 to 5 days. Due to the small number of trials per outcome, we did not perform any subgroup analyses with low versus high doses, and no evidence or clinical implication can be obtained regarding a certain dosing regimen. </p> <p>Overall, although we were able to increase the certainty of evidence in this review update, we are still in need of good‐quality trials in relevant populations to obtain evidence that would justify the use of ivermectin in regular patient care.

Three of the 11 trials had an open‐label design and used standard of care alone as comparators. All other trials were placebo‐controlled trials. Standard of care must be the same between the individual trials' arms. There are several trials circulating that investigate various concomitant medications (e.g. doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, zinc) in addition to ivermectin. Due to unproven efficacy and possible adverse effects, these comparisons may confound the assessment of the efficacy or safety of ivermectin, and we considered the inclusion of such combination therapies inappropriate. The same accounts for the comparison of ivermectin with an active comparator that has no proven efficacy in COVID‐19. Although those types of interventions (e.g. hydroxychloroquine) were possibly used at a certain point of the pandemic with the best intentions, their use was never supported by actual evidence, and they have potential adverse effects (<a href="./references#CD015017-bbs2-0199" title="SinghB , RyanH , KredoT , ChaplinM , FletcherT .

As we do not know the effect of many of those experimental comparators in people with COVID‐19, consequently no reliable evidence for ivermectin can be obtained from those comparisons either. </p> <p>Finally, we found 31 ongoing trials, of which around 50% (15/31) should have been completed by mid‐2021 or else no planned completion date was stated. Twenty‐eight trials are awaiting classification of which 13, that we judged as potentially eligible, have already been completed without publication of results. When conducting the previous review version, we expected many of these trials to be published by the end of 2021. By contrast, we discovered that 70% of the completed trials (9/13) and about 50% (8/15) of ongoing trials should have been completed more than 6 months ago, but their results have not been published in trial registries, preprint servers or journals. After this amount of time, it seems unlikely that trial data will become available from those trials, for whatever reasons. Given those numbers, we think it will be necessary to consider publication bias in the next review update. </p> </section> <section id="CD015017-sec-0096"> <h3 class="title" id="CD015017-sec-0096">Certainty of the evidence</h3> <p>The certainty of evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings tables ranged from very low to high (<a href="./full#CD015017-tbl-0001">summary of findings Table 1</a>; <a href="./full#CD015017-tbl-0002">summary of findings Table 2</a>).

In the previous review version, we excluded high risk of bias trials from the primary analysis, with the aim to remove biased data and untrustworthy trials. However, to be transparent, all trials were presented in a secondary analysis. After all, the result of the research integrity assessment – inclusion of prospectively registered RCTs only ‐ was comparable to the exclusion of high risk of bias trials from the primary analysis. Nevertheless, in this review update we downgraded the certainty of evidence one level due to serious risk of bias for all inpatient outcomes and four of nine outpatient outcomes because we assessed at least one of the results as having 'some concerns' of bias. Details of the risk of bias assessments per outcome are reported in <a href="#CD015017-sec-0059">Risk of bias in included studies</a>. </p> <p>Another limitation for the certainty of evidence was the low number of participants, events, or both leading to wide CIs and uncertainty of the estimated effects. We downgraded all outcomes included in the summary of findings tables for inpatients one or two levels for imprecision. In the outpatient setting, the number of analysed participants increased for all outcomes in this update. This improved the quality of the evidence, especially for mortality compared to the previous review update. For the newly‐available outcome of 'quality of life', results were precise, so we could grade certainty of the evidence as high. However, due to few events resulting in wide CIs, we had to downgrade one level for imprecision for several outpatient outcomes. </p> <p>Heterogeneity was no reason to downgrade the certainty of evidence for treatment of inpatients. This is mainly due to the small number of trials per meta‐analysis. In the outpatient setting, we downgraded certainty of evidence one level for serious inconsistency in three outcomes with moderate to substantial heterogeneity. Those were 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' (I<sup>2</sup> = 44%), 'all initial symptoms resolved at day 14' (I<sup>2</sup> = 57%), and 'any adverse events during the trial period' (I<sup>2</sup> = 80%). </p> <p>We did not downgrade any of the outcomes included in the summary of findings tables for indirectness. In all cases, the effect estimates were based on comparisons of interest, on the population of interest, and on outcomes of interest. In the current phase of the pandemic, it is still difficult to reliably assess the risk of publication bias. In this update, we still did not downgrade for publication bias for any outcome. However, as explained above this will probably change in future updates of this review. </p> </section> <section id="CD015017-sec-0097"> <h3 class="title" id="CD015017-sec-0097">Potential biases in the review process</h3> <p>This review aimed to provide a complete and updated evidence profile for ivermectin with regard to efficacy and safety for postexposure prophylaxis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and treatment of COVID‐19 based on current Cochrane standards (<a href="./references#CD015017-bbs2-0159" title="HigginsJP , ThomasJ , ChandlerJ , CumpstonM , LiT , PageMJ , et al, editor(s).

CEOsys is a consortium of clinical and methodological experts supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research to synthesize clinical evidence during this global pandemic. The medical information specialists of this consortium carried out a rigorous search of electronic databases, including preprint servers and clinical trial registries, to identify the complete extent of published and ongoing trials on this topic. Additionally, we screened reference lists of included trials and compared our search results with those from the living network meta‐analysis (e.g. <a href="./references#CD015017-bbs2-0141" title="COVID-NMA working group.

Considering it a justifiable compromise between being as up to date as possible in the dynamic of this pandemic and reasons of practicability, we set February 2022 the deadline for inclusion of newly published trial results for this review update. Hence, after initially closing the trial pool for this review update, we identified one trial with more than 1000 participants, previously classified as ongoing, that published its results in March 2022.

In accordance with this review series, we updated our review's outcomes to overcome competing risks. We added outcomes for inpatients and outpatients that aim to simultaneously capture all participants of the population with clinical worsening and all participants with clinical improvement. This was possible by using composite outcomes, e.g. combining 'new need for invasive mechanical ventilation' and 'death' as clinical worsening for inpatients, and combining 'admission to hospital' and 'death' for outpatients. Clinical improvement for inpatients was represented by the 'number of participants discharged alive within the same time period' used for clinical worsening, and for outpatients as 'complete resolution of initial symptoms'. </p> <p>We sent data requests to trial authors if parts of the new outcome set were reflected in the respective trial outcomes.
