However, worldwide, many children do not receive all recommended vaccinations, for several potential reasons. Vaccines might be unavailable, or parents may experience difficulties in accessing vaccination services; for instance, because of poor quality health services, distance from a health facility, or lack of money. Some parents may not accept available vaccines and vaccination services. </p> <p>Our understanding of what influences parentsâ views and practices around childhood vaccination, and why some parents may not accept vaccines for their children, is still limited. </p> <p>This synthesis links to Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness of interventions to improve coverage or uptake of childhood vaccination. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0002"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0002">Objectives</h3> <p>Â â Explore parentsâ and informal caregiversâ views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, and the factors influencing acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance of routine childhood vaccination. </p> <p>â Develop a conceptual understanding of what and how different factors reduce parental acceptance of routine childhood vaccination. </p> <p>â Explore how the findings of this review can enhance our understanding of the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0003"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0003">Search methods</h3> <p>We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and three other databases for eligible studies from 1974 to June 2020. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0004"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0004">Selection criteria</h3> <p>We included studies that: utilised qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; focused on parentsâ or caregiversâ views, practices, acceptance, hesitancy, or refusal of routine vaccination for children aged up to six years; and were from any setting globally where childhood vaccination is provided. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0005"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0005">Data collection and analysis</h3> <p>We used a preâspecified sampling frame to sample from eligible studies, aiming to capture studies that were conceptually rich, relevant to the review's phenomenon of interest, from diverse geographical settings, and from a range of incomeâlevel settings. We extracted contextual and methodological data from each sampled study. We used a metaâethnographic approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of criteria used in previous Cochrane Reviews and originally based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme quality assessment tool for qualitative studies. We used the GRADEâCERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We integrated the findings of this review with those from relevant Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness. We did this by mapping whether the underlying theories or components of trial interventions included in those reviews related to or targeted the overarching factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination identified by this review. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0006"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0006">Main results</h3> <p>We included 145 studies in the review and sampled 27 of these for our analysis. Six studies were conducted in Africa, seven in the Americas, four in SouthâEast Asia, nine in Europe, and one in the Western Pacific. Studies included urban and rural settings, and highâ, middleâ, and lowâincome settings. </p> <p>Many complex factors were found to influence parentsâ vaccination views and practices, which we divided into four themes. </p> <p>Firstly, parentsâ vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by their broader ideas and practices surrounding health and illness generally, and specifically with regards to their children, and their perceptions of the role of vaccination within this context. Secondly, many parentsâ vaccination ideas and practices were influenced by the vaccination ideas and practices of the people they mix with socially. At the same time, shared vaccination ideas and practices helped some parents establish social relationships, which in turn strengthened their views and practices around vaccination. Thirdly, parents' vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by wider political issues and concerns, and particularly their trust (or distrust) in those associated with vaccination programmes. Finally, parents' vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by their access to and experiences of vaccination services and their frontline healthcare workers. </p> <p>We developed two concepts for understanding possible pathways to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination. </p> <p>The first concept, âneoliberal logicâ, suggests that many parents, particularly from highâincome countries, understood health and healthcare decisions as matters of individual risk, choice, and responsibility. Some parents experienced this understanding as in conflict with vaccination programmes, which emphasise generalised risk and population health. This perceived conflict led some parents to be less accepting of vaccination for their children. </p> <p>The second concept, âsocial exclusionâ, suggests that some parents, particularly from lowâ and middleâincome countries, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their experiences of social exclusion. Social exclusion may damage trustful relationships between government and the public, generate feelings of isolation and resentment, and give rise to demotivation in the face of public services that are poor quality and difficult to access. These factors in turn led some parents who were socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a way to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, costs, and distress it creates. </p> <p>Many of the overarching factors our review identified as influencing parents' vaccination views and practices were underrepresented in the interventions tested in the four related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0007"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0007">Authors' conclusions</h3> <p>Our review has revealed that parentsâ views and practices regarding childhood vaccination are complex and dynamic social processes that reflect multiple webs of influence, meaning, and logic. We have provided a theorised understanding of the social processes contributing to vaccination acceptance (or not), thereby complementing but also extending more individualistic models of vaccination acceptance. Successful development of interventions to promote acceptance and uptake of childhood vaccination will require an understanding of, and then tailoring to, the specific factors influencing vaccination views and practices of the group(s) in the target setting. The themes and concepts developed through our review could serve as a basis for gaining this understanding, and subsequent development of interventions that are potentially more aligned with the norms, expectations, and concerns of target users. </p> </section> </div> </section> <section class="pls"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD013265-abs-0002" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Plain language summary <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> <div class="section-language-toggles"> <span class="section-languages-legend">available in</span> <nav class="section-languages"> <li class="section-language"> <a class="is-active" href="full/en#CD013265-abs-0002">English</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/de#CD013265-abs-0003">Deutsch</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/es#CD013265-abs-0019">EspaÃ±ol</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/fa#CD013265-abs-0013">ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Û</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/fr#CD013265-abs-0015">FranÃ§ais</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/ja#CD013265-abs-0011">æ¥æ¬èª</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/ms#CD013265-abs-0010">Bahasa Malaysia</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/pl#CD013265-abs-0016">Polski</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/ro#CD013265-abs-0017">RomÃ¢nÄ</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/ru#CD013265-abs-0007">Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/th#CD013265-abs-0009">à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/zh_HANS#CD013265-abs-0005">ç®ä½ä¸­æ</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/zh_HANT#CD013265-abs-0006">ç¹é«ä¸­æ</a> </li> </nav> </div> </div> <div class="abstract abstract_plainLanguageSummary" id="CD013265-abs-0002" lang="en"> <h3>What factors influence parentsâ views and practices around routine childhood vaccines?</h3> <p><b>Review aim</b> </p> <p>This Cochrane synthesis of qualitative evidence aimed to explore the factors that influence parentsâ views and practices around routine childhood vaccines. To do this, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies of parentsâ views, experiences, and practices. </p> <p>This synthesis complements other Cochrane Reviews assessing the effect of strategies to improve the uptake of childhood vaccination. </p> <p><b>Key messages</b> </p> <p>Many factors influence parentsâ vaccination views and practices, including those related to individual perceptions, social relationships, and the wider context in which parents live. When parents make decisions about vaccination for their children, they are often communicating not just what they think about vaccines, but also who they are, what they value, and with whom they identify. </p> <p><b>What was studied in this synthesis?</b> </p> <p>Childhood vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent serious illnesses and deaths in children. However, worldwide, many children do not receive all recommended vaccinations. There are several potential reasons for this. Vaccines might be unavailable, or parents may experience difficulties in accessing vaccination services. Some parents may not accept available vaccines and vaccination services. </p> <p>Our understanding of what influences parentsâ views and practices around childhood vaccination, and why some parents may not accept vaccines for their children is still limited. Qualitative research explores how people perceive and experience the world around them, and is therefore wellâplaced for examining these issues. </p> <p><b>What are the main findings of the review?</b> </p> <p>We included 27 studies in our analysis.

The questions and prompts are based on the findings of this review (see <a href="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=z1807091016511013500204773334450&amp;format=JATS#APP-03" target="_blank">Appendix 3</a>). They also align with implications identified in a linked review on perceptions and experiences of communication about routine childhood vaccination (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0286" title="AmesHM , GlentonC , LewinS . Parents' and informal caregivers' views and experiences of communication about routine childhood vaccination: a synthesis of qualitative evidence.

[DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011787.pub2]">Ames 2017b</a>). </p> <p>When applying these questions and prompts, please consider the following points.</p> <p>The studies in our review took place in settings or amongst populations that may differ from your own. Not all factors will therefore necessarily be applicable. Similarly, our review suggests that parents may accept some vaccines for some diseases, but not others. Successful development and implementation of interventions will require an understanding of, and then a tailoring to, the target setting and the target vaccine and disease. </p> <p>There are a wide range of interventions relevant to increasing childhood vaccination uptake. The questions and prompts below are not geared towards any specific strategy; they can be used to inform all strategies or help inform decisions regarding which types of strategies might be most important. </p> <p>Finally, the questions and prompts were informed by our position that adherence to the currently recommended vaccines is an important public health measure. Our perspective also recognises the importance of supporting an individualâs right to make their own decision about vaccination, including having access to evidenceâbased information about vaccination, such as side effects, evidence gaps, and uncertainties. This perspective may not be shared in all settings. It is therefore important to consider what the vaccination values, aims, and policies are in your setting, and how these may potentially diverge from the perspective provided here. </p> <p>In sum, these questions and prompts should be regarded as guidance to help stakeholders think about how best to design and deliver strategies to promote vaccination acceptance or uptake that are tailored to the specific needs, priorities, and values of their own context. </p> <p><b>1. Have you considered the broader beliefs and practices that parents in your target setting have about health and illness, and the role they perceive vaccination to play within these?</b> </p> <p> <ul id="CD013265-list-0015"> <li> <p>For instance, might parents hold various religious beliefs, or naturalistic views about health and illness, that may reduce acceptance of vaccination? Or might parents hold certain beliefs about infants and their immune systems that might increase or decrease acceptance of vaccination? Might parents have an individualistic view of health and the risks and benefits of vaccines? Might they perceive personal responsibility and choice regarding health and healthcare decisionâmaking as more important than collective responsibility? Might parents experience these views as in conflict with vaccination promotion messages, and therefore be less accepting of vaccination? What other health beliefs might parents have, and what specific meanings, fears, or reservations about vaccination do these give rise to? </p> </li> <li> <p>Have you considered how the intervention(s) could be tailored to the specific health beliefs and practices of parents in your target setting â for instance, by providing vaccination communication that acknowledges these beliefs and practices, and attempts to address the concerns, questions, and tensions they may give rise to? </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p><b>2. Have you taken into account the social networks and groups in which parents in your target setting reside or with which they are affiliated?</b> </p> <p> <ul id="CD013265-list-0016"> <li> <p>What are the different groups (for example, social, cultural, religious, and geographical) that parents in your target setting belong to or inhabit? What are the common vaccination views and practices within these groups? For instance, is vaccination generally supported, or alternatively might nonâvaccination be a social norm, within these groups? </p> </li> <li> <p>Have you considered whether the intervention(s) could incorporate the social groups in which parents in your target setting belong, such as involving influential individuals within these groups (e.g. key opinion leaders) in the design, planning, and/or delivery of the intervention(s)? </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p><b>3. Have you considered how parents in your target setting perceive the authorities associated with vaccination programmes?</b> </p> <p> <ul id="CD013265-list-0017"> <li> <p>Might parents feel distrustful towards any of the authorities associated with vaccination programmes â for instance, government, healthcare workers, medical researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, global health agencies, or other relevant stakeholders? </p> </li> <li> <p>If so, have you considered the specific reasons for this distrust? For instance, might they perceive them to be driven by motives other than the best interests of their child, such as financial gain? Might parents be aware of or have experienced âscandalsâ in the past related to vaccination or other healthârelated issues that have made them distrustful of authorities? Might parents be distrustful of authorities because their other concerns and priorities (e.g. food, sanitation, housing, income, employment, and general healthcare) are not being met, and might nonacceptance of vaccination be a form of resistance or a mechanism to have their other concerns and priorities addressed? </p> </li> <li> <p>Have you considered whether the intervention(s) could be tailored to address the specific reasons for parentsâ distrust, such as dialogueâbased approaches inviting open discussion about the reasons for distrust and how services could be reorganised in ways that might increase trust? Or could the interventions developed incorporate broader development goals by providing a wider range of basic services or goods along with vaccination? Alternatively, have you considered collaborating with groups or individuals that are known to be a trusted source amongst parents (e.g. nonâgovernmental organisations, local opinion leaders, etc.), potentially involving them in the design, planning, and/or delivery of the intervention(s)? </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p><b>4. Have you considered the social or economic challenges parents in your target setting may face in accessing vaccination services?</b> </p> <p> <ul id="CD013265-list-0018"> <li> <p>For instance, do parents need to travel long distances to get to vaccination services? Might parents have demanding daily schedules that make it difficult to take time out for vaccination? What other struggles may parents face in negotiating vaccination services for their children? </p> </li> <li> <p>Have you considered whether the intervention(s) could target the specific barriers parents face in accessing vaccination â for instance, through the provision of vaccination outreach or mobile vaccination teams that bring vaccination closer to where parents live? </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p><b>5. Have you considered whether there are features of vaccination services in your target setting that parents might find undesirable or inconvenient?</b> </p> <p> <ul id="CD013265-list-0019"> <li> <p>For instance, might vaccination involve (formal or informal) costs for parents? Or might parents experience long waiting times for vaccination? Or are regular vaccine stockâouts an issue in your healthcare facility? Or might there be procedures that parents need to follow in order to obtain vaccination (e.g. those pertaining to the vaccination booklet) that they might find constraining or complicated to follow? </p> </li> <li> <p>Have you considered whether the intervention(s) could be tailored to address the specific features of vaccination services that might diminish parentsâ acceptance of vaccination or trust in vaccination programmes, or both, in your target setting? For instance, if vaccine stockâouts are a regular feature of your health facility, can you identify what the underlying reasons for stockâouts are and how these problems could be addressed? Could the logistical procedures parents need to follow for vaccination be potentially redesigned, so they are more responsive to parents' needs and circumstances? Could the physical environment at your health facility be reorganised to facilitate more efficient vaccination delivery? Could aspects of vaccination programmes (e.g. healthcare worker incentives for vaccination) that foster parents' distrust be rethought and potentially restructured? </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p><b>6. Have you considered the âsocialâ nature of vaccination services, and how this might be experienced by parents?</b> </p> <p> <ul id="CD013265-list-0020"> <li> <p>For instance, might some parents experience attendance of vaccination services as a positive social event, one whereby they receive affirmation about themselves and their children? Alternatively, might some parents (e.g. poorer women, immigrants, fathers) feel judged or alienated by others when attending vaccination services? </p> </li> <li> <p>Have you considered whether the intervention(s) could draw upon and promote the positive social aspects of vaccination services? At the same time, could the delivery of vaccination be rethought and potentially restructured so that less integrated parents might feel less judged or alienated when attending vaccination services? </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p><b>7. Have you considered how parents in your target setting feel about the interactions they have with healthcare workers?</b> </p> <p> <ul id="CD013265-list-0021"> <li> <p>For instance, do they feel supported or mistreated by healthcare workers? Do they feel they can have open, respectful discussions with healthcare workers in a caring, sensitive, and nonâjudgemental way? Do they feel they can ask healthcare workers questions and receive clear and respectful answers? Do parents perceive the vaccination information they receive from healthcare workers as impartial, balanced, independent, and transparent? </p> </li> <li> <p>Have you considered intervention(s) that specifically target healthcare workers â for instance, by making them aware of the influence their interactions with parents may have, providing them with training in communication skills or increased supervision and support, or adapting the types of vaccination information healthcare workers have access to and provide to parents?

In particular, future qualitative studies should provide more detailed and transparent reporting of sampling methods and data analysis. These studies should also pay more attention to, and provide evidence for, the researchersâ roles in the study and their prior assumptions and standpoints, and how these may have impacted on the process and findings of the study (i.e. researcher reflexivity). </p> <p>Qualitative research about parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination needs to include a broader spectrum of contexts and population groups. In particular, more studies are needed in the regions of South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Moreover, more studies with parents from higher socioeconomic groups in LMICs and amongst minority or more marginalised groups in HICs would be beneficial. For example, the findings from a study included in this review amongst parents from higher socioeconomic groups in Brazil revealed that these parents may hold neoliberal values and views similar to those held by parents in HICs. It would be useful for studies in other LMICs to explore this issue further. Similarly, the findings from one study included in this review amongst Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller parents in Britain revealed that socioeconomic challenges in accessing vaccination services may reduce these parents' acceptance of vaccination in a similar way to many parents in LMICs. It would be useful for studies to determine the relevance of this issue amongst parents from other marginalised or minority groups in HICs. </p> <p>Future studies should also consider the perceptions of fathers, to help give us a better understanding of their viewpoints and how gender identities, roles, and relations might influence ideas and practices regarding childhood vaccination. This understanding would facilitate further development of conceptual and theoretical models in this area. Finally, more qualitative research is needed on the drivers of childhood vaccination acceptance and active demand (as opposed to hesitancy and refusal), which could provide important insights into how vaccination acceptance uptake might be sustained over time. </p> <p>Future quantitative studies on vaccination acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance that examine levels of influence beyond individual factors (i.e. to also incorporate community or contextual factors) would be worthwhile. Future trials should consider incorporating interventions that target a broader array of factors influencing parents' vaccination views and practices, with consideration of the factors identified in this review. Specifically, there is a need for more interventions which target parentsâ broader health beliefs and practices, the social networks and groups with which parents are affiliated, the interactions and forms of communication between healthcare workers and parents, and the contextâspecific factors potentially contributing to parents' distrust in vaccination.Â  </p> <p>In future updates of this review, we will consider how studies from nonâanglophone countries might be better represented; for example, by broadening the scope of regional databases searched, employing an alternative (potentially more aggregative) qualitative synthesis approach, or adding review authors who speak additional languages so that studies published in a wider range of languages can potentially be included. Moreover, for findings which were downgraded in the GRADEâCERQual assessments, in future updates of this review, we will consider whether any studies that were included but not sampled could contribute data to enhance confidence. </p> </section> </section> </section> <section class="summaryOfFindings"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD013265-sec-0008" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Summary of findings <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="summaryOfFindings" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD013265-sec-0008"></div> <div class="table" id="CD013265-tbl-0001"> <table class="summary-of-findings framed"><a class="open-table-viewer open-in-figure-viewer" href="#0">Open in table viewer</a><div class="table-heading"><span class="table-label">Summary of findings 1.</span>Â <span class="table-title">Summary of qualitative findings (SoQF) table</span></div> <tbody> <tr class="separated"> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Summary of review findings</b> </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Studies contributing to the review finding</b> </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>GRADEâCERQual assessment of confidence in the evidence</b> </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Explanation of GRADEâCERQual assessment</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr class="separated"> <th align="" class="headercell" colspan="4" rowspan="1" scope="col" valign="top"> <p><b>Â </b> </p> <p><b>Theme 1: ideas and practices surrounding (child) health and illness</b> </p> </th> </tr> <tr class="separated"> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>Finding 1: religious beliefs.</b> Some parents were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to the religious beliefs they held, and the view that illness, including in children, can only be prevented by divine providence.

These discourses understand health as individualised, and healthârelated risks and decisions as matters of individual choice and responsibility. Furthermore, these discourses suggest that being a âgoodâ and responsible person in the world means consistently assessing oneâs own, individual healthârelated risks, seeking and questioning evidence about such risks, proactively avoiding and managing such risks, and understanding that one is singularly accountable for the outcomes that ensue. Some parents experienced this worldview as in conflict with vaccination promotion messages, which tend to be informed by other types of discourses. The discourses underpinning vaccination promotion messages frequently emphasise generalised risk and safety statistics, claim that âdoctor knows bestâ, ask people to trust authorities and follow what they promote, and advocate for social responsibility and the health of the community. Parentsâ perceived tension between the discourses informing their own worldview and those of vaccination promotion messages led some to resist these messages and be less accepting of vaccination.Â  </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0112" title="RogersA , PilgrimD .

Social exclusion may involve economic disadvantage, residential segregation, a lack of political representation or power, discrimination and unequal protection of rights, and a myriad of socioeconomic barriers to good quality public services, including vaccination. Social exclusion weakened trustful governmentâcitizen relations, generated feelings of alienation from, and resentment towards, the state and others, and gave rise to frustration and demotivation in the face of structural challenges. These factors in turn led some parents who are socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, effort, (opportunity) costs and distress it creates. </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0097" title="LeachM , FairheadJ .

Various concepts and definitions have been used, sometimes interchangeably, including: nonacceptance, refusal, hesitancy, confidence, trust, demand, uptake. However, there is agreement in the literature that traditional understandings of individuals and groups as either âantiââ or âproââ vaccines are inadequate. Rather, vaccination views and practices are thought to exist along a continuum, from nonacceptance of all vaccines to active support of all immunisation recommendations (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0339" title="FeemsterKA .

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines vaccineâhesitant individuals as: "a heterogeneous group who hold varying degrees of indecision about specific vaccines or vaccination in general.

The âC frameworksâ seek to identify the psychological determinants of vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal, drawing on psychological models of decisionâmaking behaviour, such as the health belief model (HBM) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). In contrast, PerettiâWatel and colleagues have reformulated the âC frameworksâ to incorporate the major structural features of contemporary societies (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0416" title="Peretti-WatelP , LarsonHJ , WardJK , SchulzWS , VergerP .

Their model conceptualises vaccine hesitancy as a twoâdimensional decisionâmaking process, that depends on peopleâs level of commitment to modern societyâs risk culture, or âhealthismâ, and their trust in the authority of healthcare providers and mainstream medicine. </p> <p>Alternative approaches have drawn on adaptations of ecological models of health behaviour to identify the multiple and interrelated levels of influence impacting on vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0433" title="SturmLA , MaysRM , ZimetGD .

For example, the WHO has developed a 'Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix', which categorises factors under three domains: contextual influences, including sociocultural and health systems factors; individual and group influences, including those arising from personal perceptions of a vaccine; and vaccineâ or vaccinationâspecific issues, including individual assessments of risks and benefits and the effects of the mode of administration (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0444" title="The SAGE Vaccine Hesitancy Working Group, WHO.

In addition, while current models have provided important insights into what factors potentially influence vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance, few provide a comprehensive and theoretical understanding of how these factors operate and interact (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0319" title="CooperS , OkeibunorJC , WiyehA , WiysongeCS . Knowledge advances and gaps on the demand side of vaccination. Lancet Infectious Diseases2019;19(1):13-5.">Cooper 2019</a>). In addition, few existing models are based on empirical qualitative evidence. For example, the WHOâs 'Three C' framework was developed by reviewing existing conceptual models for grouping vaccine hesitancy determinants, and by taking into consideration model complexity, understandability, global applicability, breadth of factors considered, and potential usefulness in informing the development of vaccine hesitancy indicators and survey questions (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0392" title="MacDonaldNE . Vaccine hesitancy: definition, scope and determinants. Vaccine2015;33(34):4161-4.">MacDonald 2015</a>). Similarly, the WHOâs 'Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix' was derived from determinants identified in a commissioned systematic (quantitative) review of determinants, the collective experience and insights of members of the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) working group on vaccine hesitancy, and consultation with experts working in the field (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0380" title="LarsonHJ , JarrettC , EckersbergerE , SmithDM , PatersonP .

In addition to identifying what factors might be most relevant, we also sought to build theory about how different factors come together to reduce acceptance of routine childhood vaccination. This might contribute to the development or refinement of conceptual models of vaccination acceptance, built on a broader evidenceâbase and more theoretical in nature. </p> <p>In this review, we focus on factors that may âenhanceâ or âreduceâ acceptance of vaccination as a way of capturing the continuous, as opposed to categorical nature, of vaccination views and practices. If a study reported factors associated with a specific vaccination stance (e.g. delayed vaccination, nonacceptance, hesitancy, etc.), this was captured by the review findings. We also focused specifically on studies that reported on the views of parents and informal caregivers, and not those of other relevant stakeholders. This is because our intention was to understand the influencing factors considered important by, and meaningful to, vaccine target users themselves. If they reported that others had an influence on their vaccination views and practices, this was captured by the review findings. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0011"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0011">Why is it important to do this synthesis?</h3> <p>Currently, there is a large global focus on the demand side of vaccination. Various international working groups have been established to investigate this topic: a working group on vaccine hesitancy within the WHO's SAGE was formed in 2012 (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0428" title="SchusterM , EskolaJ , DuclosP .

The need is pressing to better understand the drivers of and barriers to vaccination uptake and to build national capacities to develop and implement tailored strategies to promote demand for immunisation services" (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0446" title="World Health Organization. 2018 Assessment Report of the Global Vaccine Action Plan.

The COVIDâ19 pandemic, and current global rollâout of COVIDâ19 vaccination programmes, has further heightened international concerns about, and focus on, vaccine hesitancy and refusal (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0404" title="National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

In particular, understanding parents' and informal caregivers' reasons for their vaccination views and practices could help inform the development of interventions to promote acceptance and uptake of vaccines that are better aligned with the norms, views, expectations, and potential concerns of target users, thereby potentially enhancing their acceptability and effectiveness. As stressed by Larson and colleagues, "emphasis should be placed on listening to the concerns and understanding the perceptions of the public to inform risk communication and to incorporate public perspectives in planning vaccine policies and programmes" (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0379" title="LarsonHJ , CooperLZ , EskolaJ , KatzSL , RatzanS . Addressing the vaccine confidence gap. Lancet2011;378(9790):526-35.">Larson 2011</a>). </p> <p>Qualitative research is wellâplaced for exploring complex perceptions, practices, and decisionâmaking, and for understanding how different factors influence these. Data arising from qualitative studies can help answer questions regarding what people think about vaccines, their practices around vaccination, their vaccination decisionâmaking processes, and the reasons for these views, practices, and decisions. A better understanding of these issues, and their impact in different settings, can help identify what factors influence parental vaccination decisionâmaking, and how they do so. This, in turn, can help us think through which interventions may be most appropriate for enhancing vaccination acceptance and uptake, and why. </p> <p>Various reviews have focused on the demand side of childhood vaccination (seeÂ <a href="#CD013265-tbl-0002">Table 1</a>Â for a summary of these reviews). Many of these reviews are dated, limited in geographical scope (i.e. include studies only from HICs), focused on specific vaccines or broader populations than children, and are not âsystematicâ in their approach. In addition, few existing reviews include qualitative studies, and amongst those that do, in most cases, the results were synthesised quantitatively or in a narrative summary. Carrying out an upâtoâdate qualitative review that systematically explores the factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, from the perspective of parents and informal caregivers and across a variety of regions and vaccines, will provide a single point of access for synthesised qualitative evidence on childhood vaccination acceptance to inform immunisation policy and strategies. </p> <div class="table" id="CD013265-tbl-0002"> <table><a class="open-table-viewer open-in-figure-viewer" href="#0">Open in table viewer</a><div class="table-heading"><span class="table-label">Table 1.</span>Â <span class="table-title">Summary of related published reviews focused on the demand side of childhood vaccination</span></div> <tbody> <tr> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><b>Author/</b> </p> <p><b>date</b> </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Title</b> </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Focus</b> </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"> <p><b>Methodology</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0335" title="DubeE , GagnonD , MacDonaldN , BocquierA , Peretti-WatelP , VergerP .

Therefore, we decided to use âconceptual richnessâ as our primary sampling criterion, to ensure that those studies included in the analysis were conceptually rich enough to enable translation and explanation of concepts which go beyond the settings of individual studies. </p> <p>While there is a tool to assess the data richness of qualitative studies (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0287" title="AmesH , GlentonC , LewinS . Purposive sampling in a qualitative evidence synthesis: a worked example from a synthesis on parental perceptions of vaccination communication. BMC Medical Research Methodology2019;19(1):26.">Ames 2019a</a>), to our knowledge, there is no existing tool to assess the conceptual richness of qualitative studies. Therefore, we developed our own assessment scale by drawing on the typology of the type and nature of qualitative findings developed byÂ <a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0426" title="SandelowskiM , BarrosoJ . Handbook for Synthesizing Qualitative Research. New York (NY): Springer Publishing Company, 2007.">Sandelowski 2007</a>. This typology conceives qualitative findings as being located along a continuous spectrum based on the degree of abstraction of analysis and interpretation of the data, or what is referred to as the extent of âdata transformationâ. At one end of the spectrum are more descriptive findings; that is, findings that describe patterns in the data. At the other end of the spectrum are interpretive or explanatory findings. These transformed findings have a high level of abstraction and provide theoretical interpretations or explanations of the patterns in the data. </p> <p>We created a simple 1 to 5 scale for categorising studies on this spectrum of data transformation (<a href="#CD013265-fig-0001">Figure 1</a>).

Comparison of their assessments revealed a fair degree of consensus. Therefore, one reviewer (SC) performed the assessment on the remaining eligible studies, which was subsequently checked by a second reviewer (BS). We sampled all studies that scored a 3 or higher on the scale, which comprised 30 studies from 56 articles. </p> <p>Metaâethnography requires studies that are not only conceptually rich, but which are also likely to make an important contribution to the synthesis (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0405" title="NoblitGW , HareRD .

London (UK): Sage, 1988.">Noblit 1988</a>;Â <a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0312" title="CampbellR , PoundP , MorganM , Daker-WhiteG , BrittenN , PillR , et al. Evaluating meta-ethnography: systematic analysis and synthesis of qualitative research. Health Technology Assessment2011;15(43):1-164.">Campbell 2011</a>). Thus, a study may be conceptually rich, but very little of the data may relate to the question of interest of the synthesis. For example, a study which focuses on parentsâ experiences of promoting infant health and development may be conceptually rich, but the data in relation to vaccination specifically may be conceptually thin. Similar to Ames and colleagues (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0287" title="AmesH , GlentonC , LewinS . Purposive sampling in a qualitative evidence synthesis: a worked example from a synthesis on parental perceptions of vaccination communication. BMC Medical Research Methodology2019;19(1):26.">Ames 2019a</a>), we therefore employed a second sampling criterion of ârelevanceâ to assess the studies that had already been sampled. We did this by reâexamining the studies that scored 3 or higher on the conceptualârichness scale to assess their relevance with regards to the phenomenon of interest of the synthesis. Here, we asked the question: âIs the study conceptually rich in relation to the question of interest of the synthesis?â, and employed a simple âyes/noâ approach to answer this question. Through this process, we removed three studies from our pool of sampled studies, as most of their data and focus were outside of the scope of the synthesis. This resulted in 27 studies from 53 articles sampled. </p> <p>Finally, and similar to Ames and colleagues again (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0287" title="AmesH , GlentonC , LewinS . Purposive sampling in a qualitative evidence synthesis: a worked example from a synthesis on parental perceptions of vaccination communication. BMC Medical Research Methodology2019;19(1):26.">Ames 2019a</a>), we considered the geographic distribution of the sampled studies. Our review sought to develop a global understanding of the factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, including similarities and differences across different settings. Moreover, as the majority of existing reviews on the demand side of childhood vaccination have been limited to studies from HICs (seeÂ <a href="#CD013265-tbl-0002">Table 1</a>), we felt it was important to ensure our review comprised a more representative geographical spread of findings. Therefore, we extracted information on the WHO region and income level (HIC or LMIC) of all included studies and considered the geographic representation of sampled studies. We agreed that the regional and incomeâlevel distribution of sampled studies was adequate, and as such made the decision to not undertake any further sampling. Therefore, we sampled and included a total of 27 studies from 53 articles in the analysis. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0028"> <h4 class="title">Data extraction</h4> <p>We extracted contextual and methodological data for each sampled study using a form designed specifically for this review. We used this form to extract the following information (where available): study author; date of publication; country of study; highâincome country/lowâ and middleâincome country; WHO region; participant details, including total number of participants, participant group (firstâtime parent/informal caregiver, older parent/informal caregiver, etc.), gender, socioeconomic status; type of vaccine; objectives or aim; study design, including overarching methodological approach, guiding theoretical or conceptual framework, data collection and analysis methods; other contextual details (any key political, historical, and cultural factors of potential relevance). </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0029"> <h4 class="title">Assessment of methodological limitations in the included studies</h4> <p>Our inclusion criteria specified that included studies needed to use both qualitative data collection and analysis methods.

For instance, we did not include questions about the appropriateness of qualitative methodology or the specific research design used, as these were already covered in our inclusion criteria.

As the central aim of this synthesis was to derive a new conceptual understanding of the factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, we decided that a metaâethnographic approach was the most appropriate synthesis method. Metaâethnography involves induction and interpretation to translate and synthesise conceptual data identified within included studies into higherâorder interpretations. The analysis is built up study by study, in a manner that both preserves the context of the primary data within individual studies, and facilitates an understanding of how concepts in different studies are related to each other (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0348" title="FranceEF , CunninghamM , RingN , UnyI , DuncanEA , JepsonRG , et al.

The final findings of our synthesis were the outcome of acombination of deep immersion in the data, detailed reading and prior knowledge of theory, team discussion and compromise, as well as rigour, reflection, and creativity. Ultimately, these processes continued until we reached an understanding of our phenomenon of interest, an understanding which is inevitably incomplete but one with which we were satisfied. </p> <div class="figure" id="CD013265-fig-0002"> <div class="figure-caption-wrapper-top"> <nav class="inline-nav-list has-dividers"> <ul> <li><a class="open-in-figure-viewer" href="#0">Open in figure viewer</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class="figure-label">Figure 2</div> </div> <hr class="top"/><img alt="Flow diagram to illustrate analysis phases" data-id="CD013265-fig-0002" src="/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013265.pub2/media/CDSR/CD013265/image_n/nCD013265-FIG-02.png"/><hr class="bottom"/> <div class="figure-caption-wrapper-bottom"> <div class="figure-caption"> <p>Flow diagram to illustrate analysis phases</p> </div> </div> </div> <section id="CD013265-sec-0031"> <h5 class="title">Stage 1: extraction of study author interpretations (secondâorder findings) and development of brief study summaries </h5> <p>The first stage of the analysis involved undertaking a close reading and rereading of all studies to identify and extract study author interpretations (secondâorder findings), as well as a selection of corresponding participant quotes (firstâorder findings) for illustrative purposes.

For example, in some studies, the concept of âinfant fragilityâ was found to enhance vaccination acceptance, whereas in other studies, it was found to reduce vaccination acceptance. We therefore conducted both a âreciprocalâ and a ârefutationalâ translation (see 'Stage 3') for the similar and the disconfirming findings, respectively (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0348" title="FranceEF , CunninghamM , RingN , UnyI , DuncanEA , JepsonRG , et al.

Two authors (SC, BS) used a matrixâmodel approach to create a comparative table that explored whether the underlying theories or components of the interventions included in the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness reflected or targeted the factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination identified by our review. </p> <p>To create the matrix, we first reviewed our four overarching themes of factors influencing parental views and practices around childhood vaccination, and devised questions which reflected their central idea or meaning. Theme four ('Accessâsupplyâdemand interactions') contained various core ideas and so, for this theme, we created various questions to reflect this. </p> <p> <ul id="CD013265-list-0013"> <li> <p>Have parentsâ broader health beliefs and practices been considered, and the meanings, concerns, or questions about vaccination these may give rise to? </p> </li> <li> <p>Have the social networks and groups (e.g. social, cultural, religious, geographical) with which parents are affiliated been considered and potentially included? </p> </li> <li> <p>Have parentsâ perceptions of the authorities associated with vaccination programmes (e.g. government, healthcare workers, medical researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, global health agencies, or other relevant stakeholders) been considered? Has an attempt been made to address parentsâ potential distrust of these authorities? </p> </li> <li> <p>Has an attempt been made to address the social or economic challenges parents face in accessing vaccination services? </p> </li> <li> <p>Has an attempt been made to address features of vaccination services that parents might find undesirable or inconvenient? </p> </li> <li> <p>Have parentsâ experiences of the social nature of vaccination services, as a place where people gather and interact, been considered? </p> </li> <li> <p>Has an attempt been made to ensure positive interactions between healthcare workers and parents, including ensuring healthcare workers are supportive, willing to have nonâjudgemental discussions with parents about their questions and concerns regarding vaccination, and provide information that parents perceive as impartial, balanced, and unbiased? </p> </li> </ul> </p> <p>Secondly, we created a table listing these seven questions. We then assessed whether the underlying theories or components of the interventions included in the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness reflected or targetted the influencing factors. We did this by creating a summary of the underlying theories or components of each intervention, and then applying the seven questions to each intervention. Each question could be answered as yes, no, partially, or not reported/unclear, to indicate whether the influencing factor was reflected in the underlying theories or components of the intervention. We listed all of the studies from the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness in our matrix table, and added our assessment for each of the seven questions. </p> <p>After removing duplicates, there were a total of 54 interventions from the related effectiveness reviews.

Most of the studies also provided detailed descriptions of the setting(s), and the broader socioeconomic and political contexts in which the research was conducted. This extensive reporting of data and context may be attributable, at least in part, to the fact that many of the studies were described in multiple sources: the 27 sampled studies were reported in a total of 53 full texts, including three books. Moreover, many of the articles were also published in social science journals, which are frequently less stringent with word limits in comparison to health research journals. </p> <p>Across most of the studies, however, there was generally poor reporting of the methods employed, a relatively common characteristic of sociological and anthropological research (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0355" title="GreenG , ThorogoodN . Qualitative Methods for Health Research. London (UK): Sage, 2004.">Green 2004</a>). In particular, most studies provided little or no detail of both the sampling strategies employed and data analysis methods. Evidence of reflexivity and sensitivity to ethical concerns were also limited in the majority of studies. Thus, the methodological limitations of most studies primarily related to poor or inadequate reporting, which made it challenging for us to assess the appropriateness of the research methods utilised. Details of the assessments of methodological limitations for individual studies can be found inÂ <a href="./appendices#CD013265-sec-0094">Appendix 2</a>. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0053"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0053">Confidence in the review findings</h3> <p>We used the GRADEâCERQual approach to grade our confidence in 19 review findings. We graded seven as high confidence, eight as moderate confidence, and four as low confidence.Â  </p> <p>Our main concerns were connected to the methodological limitations of the studies and the relevance of the data. Common methodological limitations included limited evidence of researcher reflexivity and sensitivity to ethical considerations, as well as poor reporting of sampling and data analysis methods. The data were often assessed as being only partially relevant, mainly because the studies contributing to the finding came from specific countries (e.g. only HICs); or included a subset of the population of interest (e.g. only parents who do not accept vaccination according to the recommended schedule); or focused on specific vaccines (e.g. only MMR or only polio vaccines). We downgraded some findings due to concerns about coherence, usually because of some ambiguous data. Many of the review findings were interpretive or explanatory in nature, and as such, were often complex and comprised multiple aspects. In cases where there was strong evidence for some aspects of the review finding, but insufficient data to support other aspects, we downgraded the review finding due to concerns about coherence.

That is, the way parents think about vaccination may be shaped by their conceptions of child health specifically, influences on it, and strategies to protect it and prevent illness.

">GilesâVernick 2016</a>), what appears to matter with regards to acceptance of vaccination (or not), is whether parentsâ own ideas about child health (and associated therapeutic traditions) fit with their own ideas about vaccines and what they can do. In other words, parents may accept vaccination even if they hold views about health and vaccination that fail to match or even contradict biomedical understandings of health, disease, and immunity. At the same time, parents may reject vaccination even if they hold 'correct' biomedical views about health and vaccination. What seems important regarding vaccination acceptance (or not), is whether parents' subjective beliefs about vaccines are compatible (or incompatible) with their subjective beliefs about health and illness.Â  </p> <p>Six specific secondâorder findings emerged within this broader theme as implicated in vaccination views and practices: 1) religious beliefs; 2) the âfragileâ infant; 3) primacy of ânatureâ and âthe naturalâ; 4) individualised health, immunity, and vaccineâresponse trajectories; 5) claiming parental expertise; and 6) personal choice and responsibility. </p> <section id="CD013265-sec-0057"> <h6 class="title">Finding 1: religious beliefs.

As described by the authors of these studies, this understanding of health and illness posits that the body generally and the immune system more specifically are ânaturallyâ robust and balanced. From this perspective, many biomedical interventions, including vaccination, are seen as unnatural or artificial intrusions, ultimately compromising the bodyâs natural equilibrium and innate capabilities to prevent or cure diseases. Therefore, people who hold this view often have a strong preference for ânaturalâ health interventions over what they see as chemical or technologicallyâmediated health interventions.

Many parents, predominantly from HICs, held a view that children possess unique bodies and immune systems, and therefore, individual vaccine needs and vulnerabilities.

This idea of the individuality or particularity of each child meant that, for many parents, the risks and benefits of vaccination are not set values that can be meaningfully captured by populationâlevel data or generalised risk calculations.

Rather, children were thought to possess unique vaccine needs and vulnerabilities that vary depending on their particular composition and socioâfamilial circumstances.

These factors were considered important for determining whether their child might be less resilient or of an especially weak constitution. For many parents, this additional fragility was perceived to reduce their capacity to handle vaccines and to increase their susceptibility to adverse vaccination outcomes. This underpinned some parentsâ decision to avoid or delay vaccination until their childâs constitution had strengthened or a period of particular susceptibility had passed: âWhen he was small â he was really small, he got pneumonia.

Those parents who held a âholisticâ understanding of health and illness (see above, "âPrimacy of ânatureâ and âthe naturalââ), were particularly confident that the lifestyle their family leads mitigates disease risk and renders vaccination unnecessary for their child. This belief is illuminated by this parentâs explanation for why she decided not to vaccinate her daughter: âWe also are very conscious about how she eats and how, you know, that she eats mostly organic foodâ¦ I made all of her food at home the firstâwhen she started solidsâand so we try to keep her immune system strong in that sense as wellâ (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0110" title="ReichJ .

The following narrative by one parent clearly captures the type of thought processes many parents conveyed in this regard: âMy child suffers with severe eczemaâ¦ therefore I did not want her to have MMR when her eczema is still so bad, and make it worse.

Many parents, predominantly from HICs, perceived healthcare decisionâmaking, including vaccination, to be a matter of personal responsibility and choice. In cases where the risks of a vaccine or vaccination in general were thought to outweigh the benefits for their particular child, then these values of personal responsibility and choice were often prioritised over collective responsibility. These parents in turn tended to be less accepting of vaccination for their children (high confidence).Â  </h6> <p>Another common perception amongst parents in various HICs (USA, United Kingdom, Australia) was that healthârelated decisions, including those pertaining to vaccination, are matters of personal choice (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0112" title="RogersA , PilgrimD .

The authors of this study found that this change in sentiment facilitated these parentsâ integration and sense of belonging within their new social circumstances. Many parents also described the difficulties they faced going against the social norm of vaccination nonacceptance. They spoke about the blame and ostracism they had experienced (or would experience) if they vaccinated their child in such settings. This view is clearly reflected in the following statement from a parent in India: âNobody here is too keen about injections. It is difficult for me to take initiativeâ¦ I am in favour of this [vaccination]. But if I decide alone and take the child for vaccination and after that if the child develops even a cold, all blame will be on meâ (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0137" title="VargheseJ , RamanKV , RamanathanM .

That is, and as articulated by the authors of one study, the practice of vaccination is âan act of identification â of opting in â of proclaiming âI belongâ and âI share your valuesââ (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0122" title="SoboEJ , HuhnA , SannwaldA , ThurmanL .

In other words, through their vaccination views and practices, parents proclaim their affiliation or social communion with particular communities and associated inâgroup norms and values. These authors go on to suggest how, in circumstances when nonacceptance of vaccination or vaccination hesitancy is a social norm, the âopting outâ of vaccination can be understood as a âpositively prosocial actâ of accepting or âopting inâ to the values, identities, and lifestyles of a particular community. Conformity to the norms, values, and lifestyles of a social group can be very rewarding for individuals, whereas noncompliance can have negative consequences.

Parents' vaccination views and practices also shaped their social networks. Shared vaccination ideas and practices were a powerful force in building social relations and ties. While this phenomenon occurred amongst parents across the spectrum of vaccination attitudes, it may be particularly significant for parents who are less accepting of vaccination. In these cases, parents may be afforded access to various types of social resources, in turn potentially reinforcing both their group affiliation and their vaccination views and practices (moderate confidence). </h6> <p>Various studies demonstrated how, at the same time that parentsâ social networks influenced their vaccination ideas and practices, through these ideas and practices social networks were also being forged, consolidated, or reinforced (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0109" title="LeachM , FairheadJ .

More than these issues, however, they argue that the concept of distrust, even when disaggregated and contextualised, may actually obscure more than it reveals. As they explain, â[in] our analyses of vaccination practicesâ¦the notion of trust rarely proved helpful.

The effect of these controversies was aptly summed up by one parent who concluded, âBecause of their history of government mismanagement of public health issues in this country I think a lot of people are very, very suspicious when the government says 'oh there's nothing to worry about, don't you worryâ (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0022" title="CasidayRE .

">Casiday 2007</a>, UK, participant quote). </p> <p>One study in Britain refuted these findings, with very few parents in this study mentioning these types of controversies as influencing their trust in the government and vaccination, and several parents even actively denying any link when asked directly (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0109" title="LeachM , FairheadJ .

That is, the value of personal choice and responsibility for some parents in Britain almost implicitly assumes, and takes into account, governmental fallibility. As the study authors note, â[p]eopleâs contemporary anxieties about stateâled technocracies reflect the emergence of individuated perspectives and political philosophies surrounding health, lifestyle and choice that are rooted far more deeply than are a few instances of government reputational damageâ (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0109" title="LeachM , FairheadJ .

As outlined in a study conducted in Northern Nigeria which explored parentsâ perceptions of the Polio Eradication Initiative, the Trovan controversy involved a Pfizerâorganised clinical trial of the antibiotic Trovan in Kano State in the north during the 1996 cerebrospinal meningitis epidemic in the country (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0111" title="RenneEP .

Bloomington (IN): Indiana University Press, 2010. ">Renne 2010</a>). Several children died during the trial, and a lawsuit was filed against Pfizer for failing to fully inform participants of the risks, for âlowâdosing the control drugâ, and for withholding the fact that approved treatment for meningitis was available. The study found that this incident, and what the author describes as the governmentâs failure to properly oversee it, was mentioned by numerous parents. Many of these parents attributed their suspicions of polio immunisation to this incident, which for them, served as evidence that both Western pharmaceutical companies and local government cannot be trusted. Many parents in this study also spoke about the 2003/2004 polio vaccine boycott, whereby various political and religious leaders questioned the safety of the oral polio vaccine, which led to the boycott of polio immunisation campaigns in five states in Northern Nigeria. According to the author of this study, although the ban was eventually lifted, its impact lingered within communities, who continued to question the safety of polio immunisation and the agendas of vaccination programmes more generally (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0111" title="RenneEP .

">Renne 2010</a>). </p> <p>A final example of how particular healthârelated controversies can produce and exacerbate mistrust in authorities, and the associated impact on vaccination views and practices, is the "Family Planning Program" of the 1970s in India. A study in India revealed how distrust of the government and resistance to polio vaccination amongst some Muslims was linked, at least in part, to historical fears pertaining to the controversial "Family Planning Program" of the 1970s which promoted sterilisation as a means of population control (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0069" title="HussainRS , McGarveyST , FruzzettiLM .

">Hussain 2015</a>). Various Muslim parents in this study believed that Muslims were specifically targeted for sterilisation during the program, and that polio vaccination was a continuation of this agenda. This is clearly illustrated by one Muslim parentâs characterisation of the Family Planning Program and polio immunisation: âBefore they had done forced sterilisation, now the government is not doing this, but doing this through the polio program so that there can be no future generationsâ¦. That same program is repeating. It is happening in another guise. In another lifeâ (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0069" title="HussainRS , McGarveyST , FruzzettiLM .

Like the abovementioned study in Nigeria, this study also revealed how perceptions of this controversy, and the impact it had on parentsâ vaccination acceptance, were embroiled in the intricacies of a much wider political economy of ethnic, religious, and class relations and identities in India, both historical and contemporary (see 'Finding 13: marginalisation, inadequate public services, and priority misalignmentâ below for further details in this regard). </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0071"> <h6 class="title">Finding 13: marginalisation, inadequate public services, and priority misalignment.

Through all these experiences, people may lose confidence that those in power have their best interests at heart, increasingly questioning the real intentions of their actions and what they promote.

According to these authors, the legacy of colonialism, the Partition, and the rise of Hindu nationalism in the 1990s have rendered Muslims a sociological minority within Indian society and the victims of ethnic violence and socioâpolitical exclusion. Moreover, segregated, Muslimâmajority slums have suffered significant underdevelopment, characterised by weak basic public services, including healthcare services.

Some conveyed resentment at what they perceived as the governmentâs failure to provide basic infrastructure, while compelling them to vaccinate. Many also expressed anger at what they perceived as a misalignment of their own priorities and those of the government.

This study showed how, during the 1990s, many Northern Nigerian states experienced a deterioration of public infrastructure due to a complex set of factors: political instability and neoliberal reforms emphasising a rollingâback of the state and costârecovery for basic services. The author of the study argues that this has, in turn, undermined the benevolence of stateâcitizen relations and fostered much public distrust of government. Many parents in this study mentioned distrust of the government as a major reason for rejecting the Polio Eradication Initiative. More specifically, they expressed suspicions of the motives of government, promoting a vaccine ostensibly offered for their benefit, when other services were notably neglected and underserviced. Several parents were also distrustful of the polio vaccine, which was given for free and vigorously promoted, when other vaccines and healthcare services often incurred costs and more effort to obtain: âWe are looking for medicine in the hospital to give to our children and we canât get it but this one [polio vaccine], they are following us to our houses to give it.

Many parents were also angered by the focus on polio, when, for them, other diseases, such as malaria, measles, and meningitis, were seen to pose much bigger threats to the lives of their children. As indicated by the study author, since the polio immunisation programme was not driven by their principal priorities and concerns, many parents experienced it as a topâdown initiative that therefore couldnât be trusted (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0111" title="RenneEP .

">Renne 2010</a>), revealed that nonacceptance of vaccination could be used as a mechanism for some parents to have their principal concerns and priorities addressed. For example, various parents in India agreed to vaccinate their children only if roads were built and other medical services provided (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0025" title="ChaturvediS , DasguptaR , AdhishV , GangulyKK , RaiS , SushantL , et al.

According to the study author, these demands were met with the implementation of Immunisation Plus Days in 2006 and 2007, a broaderâbased public health initiative that provided polio vaccines together with other services such as vitamin A drops, deworming medicines, and drugs and bednets to protect against malaria. Many parents in the study expressed considerable support for this initiative, and an associated change in their views about polio vaccination, as clearly illuminated by this parentâs comment: âReally, it is a good thing they are doingâ¦ I will agree for the polio people to do polio for my child because I need the bednetâ (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0111" title="RenneEP .

In fact, the study found that, in a reversal of earlier rejection of vaccination, some parents actually took their children to receive multiple doses of the polio vaccine at different sites so they could get additional bednets.

Some of these mothers therefore avoided or delayed vaccination for their child in order to eschew judgement and disapproval from others. Both these studies also found that infant health facilities have become highly feminised spaces, attended by pregnant and postnatal women who are often accompanied by their mothers, female neighbours, and other female kin.

Thirdâorder concepts</h4> <p>In the following two concepts, we present the views and interpretations of the <b>review authors</b> regarding potential pathways to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination. </p> <section id="CD013265-sec-0078"> <h5 class="title">Finding 18: neoliberal logic. Many parents, predominantly from HICs, held a worldview informed by neoliberal discourses. These discourses understand health as individualised, and healthârelated risks and decisions as matters of individual choice and responsibility. Furthermore, these discourses suggest that being a âgoodâ and responsible person in the world means consistently assessing oneâs own individual healthârelated risks, seeking and questioning evidence about such risks, proactively avoiding and managing such risks, and understanding that one is singularly accountable for the outcomes that ensue. Some parents experienced this worldview as in conflict with vaccination promotion messages, which tend to be informed by other types of discourses. The discourses underpinning vaccination promotion messages frequently emphasise generalised risk and safety statistics, claim that âdoctor knows bestâ, ask people to trust authorities and follow what they promote, and advocate for social responsibility and the health of the community. Parentsâ perceived tension between the discourses informing their own worldview and those of vaccination promotion messages led some to resist these messages and be less accepting of vaccination (moderate confidence). </h5> <p>One potential pathway to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination can be captured by the concept of âneoliberal logicâ. This concept encapsulates the interconnected and frequently coexisting ideas held by many parents, which come together to create a particular logic of care regarding vaccination. This logic of care was common amongst parents across socioeconomic divides in HICs. It also emerged amongst parents from middleâ and higherâ socioeconomic groups in Brazil (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0008" title="BarbieriCL , CoutoMT , AithFM . Culture versus the law in the decision not to vaccinate children: meanings assigned by middle-class couples in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Cadernos de Saude Publica2017;33(2):e00173315. BarbieriCL , CoutoMT . Decision-making on childhood vaccination by highly educated parents. Revista de Saude Publica2015;49(18):1-8. ">Barbieri 2017</a>). This logic can be characterised as follows. With a view of their childâs health as individualised and inevitably fragile, parents attempt to separate out the risks of disease and the potential benefits of vaccines as they pertain to their specific child. With a view of themselves as experts of their children and a skepticism of the expert systems implicated with vaccination, parents perceive themselves as best placed to conduct this riskâbenefit calculus for their child. With a strong conviction that they are singularly responsible for their childâs health, they see this risk assessment as a moral obligation and the vaccination decision taken as ultimately a matter of personal choice. </p> <p>This particular logic of care is not an âindividualâ belief held by a select few. Rather, it is deeply rooted in, and reflects, trends in thinking that have become ubiquitous within contemporary, industrialised societies. Within these contexts, the ideas of individual responsibility and personal choice have become dominant values in recent decades. This is related to the processes of individualisation and a rollback of the state to a political agenda stressing citizensâ own rights and responsibilities.

In this era, risks have intensified in magnitude and become increasingly global: Â international disease outbreaks, nuclear war, environmental pollution, global warming, accidents, terrorism, and so forth. The nature and scope of contemporary risks make them more difficult than in the past to calculate and control, creating a climate of increased vulnerability. At the same time, central institutions and systems (government, industry, science) are increasingly viewed as partly responsible for, and unable to control, the types of risks thrown up by the processes of modernisation. Distrust and suspicion of these institutions have therefore become pervasive features of contemporary social life. </p> <p>Within this context, there has been an intensification of concern with assessing, avoiding, and managing risk, processes which have become increasingly individualised and understood as matters of personal responsibility and choice.

These kinds of vaccination views, informed by neoliberal discourses, were common amongst parents across the spectrum of vaccination attitudes in HICs: those who accepted vaccination, those who were hesitant towards vaccination, and those who refused vaccination. However, for certain parents, these views were experienced as in conflict with vaccination promotion messages. Some of these parents were particularly uneasy with the populationâlevel riskâbenefit statistics that vaccination promotion discourses provide, which they felt disregarded their childâs individual vaccination needs and vulnerabilities. Other parents resented the emphasis such discourses placed on community obligation and the health of the âherdâ, when being a good parent is associated with taking personal responsibility for whatâs best for oneâs own child. Other parents resented the claim of âdoctor knows bestâ underpinning vaccination promotion messages, when they considered themselves to have the best knowledge of their childâs strengths and vulnerabilities. Many of these parents had an inherent distrust for health authorities, and therefore objected to vaccination promotion messages asking them to be âa blind follower of the stateâ and to âuncritically trustâ what health authorities promote. Some parents also pointed to and resented the inconsistencies between these messages and other health promotion discourses which advocate for independent, reflexive decisionâmaking and personal choice. </p> <p>Therefore, the source of conflict certain parents perceived between vaccination promotion messages and their views about health and healthcare informed by neoliberal discourses varied. However, what appeared common for these parents, and what potentially separated them from other parents who accepted vaccination, was that this experienced tension was absolute and unacceptable. This, in turn, may have led them to resist vaccination promotion messages and be less accepting of vaccination. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0079"> <h5 class="title">Finding 19: social exclusion. Some parents, predominantly from LMICs, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their experiences of social exclusion. Social exclusion may involve economic disadvantage, residential segregation, a lack of political representation or power, discrimination and unequal protection of rights, and a myriad of socioeconomic barriers to good quality public services, including vaccination. Social exclusion weakened trustful governmentâcitizen relations, generated feelings of alienation from, and resentment towards, the state and others, and gave rise to frustration and demotivation in the face of structural challenges. These factors, in turn, led some parents who are socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, effort, (opportunity) costs, and distress it creates (moderate confidence). </h5> <p>Another potential pathway to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination may be captured by the concept of âsocial exclusionâ. Here we define social exclusion as a state in which individuals, communities, or areas are unable to participate fully in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of society, as well as the process leading to and sustaining such a state (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0439" title="United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Leaving no one behind: the imperative of inclusive development. Report on the World Social Situation; 2016. Available at www.un.org/esa/socdev/rwss/2016/full-report.pdf.">United Nations 2016</a>). Studies included in this review revealed how social exclusion may entail various different dimensions: poverty and inequality, including deficiencies in and poor access to basic infrastructure and functioning vaccination and other public services; residential segregation; a lack of political representation or power; discrimination; and unequal respect for and protection of rights. All of these different dimensions of social exclusion may lead parents to be less accepting of vaccination through varying mechanisms of effect. Experiences of social exclusion may rupture trustful governmentâcitizenry relations, in turn leading excluded communities to lose confidence that those in power have their best interests at heart. They may become increasingly sceptical of initiatives ostensibly offered for their advantage, when they are disadvantaged in so many other aspects of their lives. In such cases, parents may be less accepting of vaccination for their children because they do not trust the safety of vaccines, the motivations of those delivering them, or the real benefits of vaccination programmes. </p> <p>Experiences of social exclusion may also generate a climate of alienation from, and anger towards, the state and others in society. Sociallyâexcluded communities may, in turn, resent having to take part in âpublic goodâ initiatives when they feel estranged from the public in whose interests they must cooperate, and disenfranchised by the authorities asking for their participation. They may begrudge being asked to vaccinate when what they consider to be their principal concerns are neglected. In such cases, childhood vaccination may be rejected by parents as a form of resistance to authorities, or what one study author â following political scientist James Scott (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0430" title="ScottJ .

That is, it may provide sociallyâexcluded parents with a degree of agency within contexts where they are fundamentally disempowered.

Overarching line of argument</h4> <p>In the following line of argument, we present the views and interpretations of the <b>review authors</b> regarding how one might conceptualise, more broadly, parental views and practices regarding childhood vaccination. </p> <p>The overarching line of argument emerging from the analysis of the data is as follows: parentsâ views and practices regarding childhood vaccination can be conceptualised as complex and dynamic social processes that reflect multiple webs of influence, meaning, and logic. That is, parentsâ vaccination decisions usually comprise an ongoing engagement that is contingent on unfolding personal and social circumstances. Such decisions usually emerge through interacting and relating, rather than through a deliberative calculus at a single moment in time. As such, vaccination views â whatever position is taken â may be best understood as a âprocessâ, rather than an a priori or fixed âstanceâ. The procedural nature of vaccination views also means that parents' vaccination views and practices change or can potentially change. </p> <p>Moreover, parentsâ vaccination views and practices are influenced by multiple forces and carry a variety of meanings: social, political, structural, moral, as well as biological. Through their vaccination choices, parents are often reflecting their experiences of, and the meanings they attach to, broader relations, entities, and processes â big and small, past and present, directly and indirectly related to vaccination. These include, for example, parentsâ engagements with other parents, peers and community members, with healthcare institutions and their providers, with the state, with science and medicine, with global institutions and programmes, with former colonial powers. Sometimes, parentsâ vaccination views and practices are more explicitly commenting on and even challenging the nature of these relations, entities, and processes. Therefore, through their vaccination decisions, parents are often communicating not just what they think about vaccines, but also who they are, what they value, and with whom they identify. </p> <p>As such, reduced vaccination acceptance is often not about âignoranceâ or âmisinformationâ. Rather, it forms an integral part of the wider social milieu in which parents live. Nor is reduced vaccination acceptance necessarily about irrational forms of thinking. The wider social milieu in which parents live frequently contains features that make vaccination hesitancy or nonacceptance not only possible, but seem entirely logical â whether in the neoliberal world of more affluent parents or the disadvantaged world of more sociallyâexcluded parents. While the logic may not conform to the logic of vaccination programmes, it makes sense within the political, moral, structural, and conceptual landscapes of those worlds. Ultimately, recognising these logics on their own terms could provide avenues for more effectively and sensitively bridging the goals of immunisation programmes with those of parents who decide against vaccination for their children. </p> </section> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0081"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0081">Results of integrating the review findings with the Cochrane intervention reviews</h3> <p>The results of our comparison of the findings from our qualitative evidence synthesis and the findings from the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness are presented in the matrix inÂ <a href="#CD013265-fig-0008">Figure 8</a>.

In these cases, we may have gained greater clarity about the intervention if we had searched for additional information in related publications or from study authors, rather than relying solely on the information provided in the publications included in the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0082"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0082">Review author reflexivity</h3> <p>Throughout the review process, none of us held a neutral position regarding vaccination. At the outset of the review, we all believed that childhood vaccination is an important individual and public health intervention. We all fully accepted childhood vaccination according to the recommended schedules. This was based on our shared view that vaccines are mostly safe and beneficial for individuals, and that most individuals can each absorb minimal risk to safeguard those in our communities who are most vulnerable. One member of the team had the experience of unintentionally delayed and incomplete vaccination for her children, which provided her with a more nuanced experience of parental decisionâmaking about childhood vaccinations. In addition, we all held the view that individuals have a right to make their own healthcare decisions, including about vaccination. Moreover, we believed that it is important for people to have easy access to balanced and transparent information about vaccination, including about adverse effects, evidence gaps, and uncertainties. We recognised that there are many potential tensions between public health, community obligation, and individual choice, tensions which we tried to hold and grapple with throughout the review process. </p> <p>While the review did not change any of our views about vaccination, we have all been required to engage seriously with the complex logics underpinning parentsâ vaccination views and practices that may differ from our own. Through this process, many of us have recognised parts of ourselves in these views and practices, and have in turn gained a more nuanced and less judgmental understanding of diverse perspectives. </p> <p>Much of the research on the demand side of vaccination focuses on understanding what parents think, feel, and do regarding vaccines. While we as a review team shared this interest, we also wished to provide a critical and contextualised understanding of these views, emotions, and practices. This motivation informed, at least in part, our choice of a metaâethnographic analysis approach and associated decision to use 'conceptual richness' as our primary sampling strategy. These decisions inevitably also shaped the interpretive process and synthesis of the findings. Before undertaking the review, many of us had considerable prior knowledge of existing conceptual frameworks on the demand side of vaccination, as well as many of the social theories employed by the studies included in the review. We anticipated that these former understandings could both enhance and negatively impact upon the interpretive process and synthesis of the findings. We therefore employed various strategies to mitigate this potentially negative impact, and to mitigate other ways in which we might inappropriately skew the interpretation of the data and our own review findings. The team regularly discussed progress and preliminary findings, with the aims of identifying assumptions in the data synthesis, clarifying procedures and choices, and documenting various challenges faced in the review process. These discussions were greatly enhanced by our having a multidisciplinary review team, which enabled both the exploration of multiple perspectives and productive contestation. Our review team comprised authors with disciplinary backgrounds in sociology (SC), anthropology (BS, AS, CC), psychology (NL, SC), health systems (NL, CW), vaccinology (CW), and epidemiology (BS, ES, CC, CW). During our team discussions, we also tried to remain mindful of our presuppositions and, as a team, to support each other to question our own viewpoints. We also used refutational analysis techniques (âdisconfirming analysesâ) as an integral part of the data analysis. We identified various incongruencies, inconsistencies, and refutations in the data, which we explored and accounted for in our synthesis of the findings. This process deepened our interpretations and further enhanced the reflexive stance of the review team. </p> <p>A final strategy we used to try operationalise a reflexive stance was to write ourselves explicitly into the text of the review findings; for example, by commonly making statements such as âwe interpreted this to meanâ, or âwe did not identifyâ, or âwe have attempted to move away fromâ. Through this approach, we hoped to make the interactions between the studies and our own views and positions more visible, and to provide review findings that ultimately reflect a âview from somewhereâ (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0359" title="HarrawayD .

Ames and colleagues also highlighted the importance of frontline healthcare workers in influencing parents' vaccination intentions.

Ames and colleagues also revealed the importance of trust/distrust in the context of vaccination. For example, the review found: that parental attitudes towards vaccination influenced which vaccination information sources they trusted; that parents who trusted their health workers also trusted the information they provided; and that some parents distrusted information sources linked to the government. Our review supports and extends these findings by revealing how, in addition to influencing views about information sources, parents' trust or distrust in healthcare workers, government, and other forms of authority also impacts upon their views and practices about vaccination. Ames and colleagues indicated that communication is one of many interacting factors that may influence parents' and informal caregivers' decisions to take their children for vaccination, and communication alone will therefore not address all aspects of vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, or refusal. Our review provides insights into what these other aspects may be. </p> <p>The findings from our review also have commonalities with findings from other qualitative and mixedâmethods reviews focused on the demand side of childhood vaccination (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0398" title="MillsE , JadadAR , RossC , WilsonK .

As in our review, these reviews found that the manner in which healthcare workers treat parents â and specifically whether parents feel respected, supported, and listened to (or not) by healthcare workers â can influence what parents think and do regarding vaccination for their children.

Factors underlying parental decisions about combination childhood vaccinations including MMR: a systematic review. Vaccine2010;28(26):4235-48.">Brown 2010</a>Â found that lower vaccine uptake was associated significantly with parents who valued the right to choose whether to vaccinate, who engaged in personal research on vaccination, and who had a preference for ânaturallyâacquiredâ immunity. Relatedly,Â in their qualitative review,Â <a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0335" title="DubeE , GagnonD , MacDonaldN , BocquierA , Peretti-WatelP , VergerP . Underlying factors impacting vaccine hesitancy in high income countries: a review of qualitative studies. Expert Review of Vaccines2018;17(11):989-1004.">Dube 2018</a>Â found that parents who expressed hesitancy towards or who refused vaccination for their children commonly expressed strong feelings of personal responsibility to their children and highlighted the importance of personal choice. These parents often also placed considerable emphasis on âhealthy, natural lifestylesâ, and conveyed resentment over the pressures they felt to risk their own childâs safety for public health benefits. Both reviews also found that, when making decisions about vaccination for their children, many parents prioritised individual risk assessments over generalised or populationâlevel statistics of risks and benefits. Our own review reflects these findings, but also enhances them by trying to bring them together theoretically through our concept of a âneoliberal logicâ. There is a persepctive in some health literature that the neoliberal values of individual responsibility and choice are more common amongst higher socioeconomic groups (e.g.Â <a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0390" title="LindbladhE , LyttkensCH . Polarization in the reaction to health risk information: a question of social positions?Risk Analysis2003;23(4):841-55.">Lindbladh 2003</a>). The findings from our review does not support this perspective, but rather suggests that, at least in HICs, neoliberal values and views may be held by parents across the socioeconomic spectrum. </p> <p>Many reviews focused on the demand side of childhood vaccination included studies only from HICs (seeÂ <a href="#CD013265-tbl-0002">Table 1</a>Â for a summary of these reviews). Our review addresses this gap by incorporating, and comparing the findings of, studies from both HICs and LMICs. We identified both differences and commonalities in the findings between these study groups. One of the main differences relates to potential sociocultural variations in ideas and practices surrounding health and illness, and associated perceptions of the role of vaccination. For example, we suggested that a âneoliberal logicâ of health may be more applicable to parents in HICs as a potential pathway to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination. However, one study conducted in Brazil included in our review (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0008" title="BarbieriCL , CoutoMT , AithFM . Culture versus the law in the decision not to vaccinate children: meanings assigned by middle-class couples in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Cadernos de Saude Publica2017;33(2):e00173315. BarbieriCL , CoutoMT . Decision-making on childhood vaccination by highly educated parents. Revista de Saude Publica2015;49(18):1-8. ">Barbieri 2017</a>), found this type of logic to be very common amongst parents from middle and higher socioeconomic groups. More research is needed to determine the relevance of this finding amongst parents from middle and higher socioeconomic groups in other LMICs. Another main difference our review found between findings from HIC and LMIC studies was the role of access challenges and suboptimal vaccination services and delivery logistics. These issues, common in many resourceâlimited settings, emerged as impacting negatively on vaccination acceptance amongst parents in many LMICs. However, access challenges were found to be an important issue impacting upon vaccination acceptance amongst Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller parents in one study in Britain included in this review (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0121" title="NewtonP , SmithDM .

Structural barriers to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisation uptake in Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities in the United Kingdom. Critical Public Health2017;27(2):238-47. ">Smith 2017</a>). More research is therefore needed to determine the relevance of this issue amongst parents from other minority or marginalised groups in HICs. </p> <p>There were, however, also many commonalities that emerged in the studies from HICs and LMICs. The mutuallyâreinforcing relationship between parentsâ vaccination ideas and practices and the social networks in which they are embedded was found in both HIC and LMIC studies. Moreover, a pertinent finding that emerged across study groups was the impact of distrust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination on vaccination acceptance. Similarly, the interactions parents have with frontline healthcare workers, and how these can positively and negatively influence vaccination acceptance, was another common finding between studies in HICs and LMICs. At the same time, our four thirdâorder themes and overarching line of argument were able to 'hold' and account for the findings from both HIC and LMIC studies. </p> <p>Ultimately, the <i>specific configurations</i> of influencing factors, and the particular conditions, relations, and dynamics in which they are rooted, may differ between HIC and LMIC (and potentially other) contexts. Yet we would argue that the <i>broader categories</i> of influencing factors developed and applied in this review, and our overarching conceptualisation of vaccination, are potentially applicable across country income divides. </p> <p>The findings from our review support and also enhance various existing conceptual and theoretical models of the demand side of vaccination. Our concept of âneoliberal logicâ aligns with, and provides empirical support for, the theoretical framework of vaccine hesitancy proposed by PerettiâWatel and colleaguesÂ (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0416" title="Peretti-WatelP , LarsonHJ , WardJK , SchulzWS , VergerP . Vaccine hesitancy: clarifying a theoretical framework for an ambiguous notion. PLoS Current Outbreaks2015;7.">PerettiâWatel 2015</a>). This framework conceptualises vaccine hesitancy as a twoâdimensional decisionâmaking process that depends on peopleâs level of commitment to modern societyâs risk culture, or âhealthismâ, and their trust in the authority of healthcare providers and mainstream medicine. Our reviewâs concept of âsocial exclusionâ provides possible insights into how this framework might be expanded to incorporate other major structural features of contemporary societies, thereby enhancing its potential generalisability. </p> <p>The four thirdâorder themes of our review also align with, and provide empirical support for, existing socioâecological conceptual models of vaccination acceptance, including the WHOâs âVaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrixâ (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0433" title="SturmLA , MaysRM , ZimetGD .

These models understand vaccination decisionâmaking as shaped by interrelated factors operating at multiple levels (e.g. intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community). Our review identifies several factors which may be important at different levels of influence. Our review also provides insights into how these factors might function and interact to influence vaccination views and practices. In particular, through our thirdâorder concepts of âneoliberal logicâ and âsocial exclusionâ, our review provides a theorised understanding of two potential mechanisms or pathways through which different factors, at different levels, might interact to reduce vaccination acceptance. </p> <p>These mechanisms or pathways may also supplement the core theoretical constructs of the various âC frameworksâ. The 'C frameworks' draw on psychological models (e.g. the Health Belief Model and Theory of Planned Behaviour, amongst many others) to understand the psychological processes underpinning vaccination decisionâmaking (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0444" title="The SAGE Vaccine Hesitancy Working Group, WHO.

Informed by critical social theories, the two thirdâorder concepts developed in this review (âneoliberal logicâ and âsocial exclusionâ) provide insights into potential social processes or mechanisms underpinning vaccination decisionâmaking. Therefore, these could potentially be used to complement and extend the core psychological constructs of the âC frameworksâ. </p> <p>In terms of the four related published Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness, as revealed in the matrix inÂ <a href="#CD013265-fig-0008">Figure 8</a>, many of the overarching factors our review identified as influencing parents' vaccination views and practices were underrepresented in the interventions tested in the studies. In particular, relatively few interventions considered or targeted parentsâ broader health beliefs and practices, the social networks and groups with which parents are affiliated, and the interactions and forms of communication between healthcare workers and parents. No interventions appeared to consider parentsâ experiences of the social nature of vaccination services. Moreover, seven of the eight interventions that addressed the issue of trust/distrust in vaccination focused specifically on providing a range of basic services or goods along with vaccination. Our review found that inadequate public services or goods may be just one of the many complex reasons for parents' distrust of vaccination. Future trials should consider incorporating interventions that target a wider array of factors influencing parents' vaccination views and practices. Specifically, there is a need for more interventions which target parentsâ broader health beliefs and practices, the social networks and groups with which parents are affiliated, the interactions and forms of communication between healthcare workers and parents, and the contextâspecific factors potentially contributing to parents' distrust in vaccination. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0086"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0086">Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence</h3> <p>The studies included in this review encompassed diverse countries and socioeconomic settings. The sampling approach we used (see 'Sampling of studies' above) was geared towards including only conceptuallyârich studies, and as such, the evidence of this review has a relatively high degree of depth, detail, and breadth. Moreover, nearly half (n = 13) of the studies used a longâterm ethnographic approach (sometimes spanning many years), including various types of observational and participatory methods. This may have enabled researchers to develop an inâdepth understanding of parentsâ unarticulated thoughts and actual practices, in addition to what they explicitly said. These insights may have further enhanced the completeness of the findings. It is possible, however, that our inclusion of studies published only in English, German, or French led to the omission of findings from cultural contexts where these languages are not the norm. Similarly, our use of a purposeful sampling approach may have led to the omission of findings relevant to particular populations, settings, and experiences. For example, our sampling approach resulted in all eligible studies from the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region being excluded from the analysis. </p> <p>All of the studies we included explored parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination. Yet a large majority of studies focused their analyses and findings on those views and practices associated with reduced acceptance (e.g. hesitancy or nonacceptance) of routine childhood vaccination. In addition, many studies only included parents who were hesitant towards or nonaccepting of routine childhood vaccination. This focus of the included studies is thus reflected in the findings of our review, which tend to concentrate on the factors associated with reduced acceptance of routine childhood vaccination. Factors that reduce and those that enhance vaccination are not necessarily binary categories that can be populated by their opposites. A greater focus specifically on the factors that enhance acceptance of routine childhood vaccination would add important insights into how acceptance might be sustained over time. </p> <p>While most of the studies targetted parents, the majority were conducted with mothers or female caregivers only. When fathers or male caregivers were included, the researchers generally did not distinguish between mothers' and fathersâ perspectives, nor did they explore any potential genderâbased differences in their analysis. Thus, we are uncertain whether fathers have the same perspectives and practices regarding childhood vaccination. </p> <p>Our review excluded studies that focused on hypothetical vaccines, future vaccines, and vaccines given in response to an outbreak situation, as we were interested in gaining a general understanding of parentsâ views and practices towards routine childhood vaccination. It is therefore unclear whether the findings of this review can be appropriately applied to nonroutine vaccines, such as those given in an outbreak. Moreover, some included studies focused on specific vaccines: six studies (all from the UK) focused exclusively on the MMR vaccine, and three studies (in India and Nigeria) focused exclusively on the polio vaccine. These vaccines in these settings have a particularly controversial history, including the publication of a nowâretracted research paper linking the combined MMR vaccine to colitis and autism spectrum disorders (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0354" title="GodleeF , SmithJ , MarcovitchH . Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent. BMJ2011;342:c7452.">Godlee 2011</a>), which was well known to the British public, and the historical, widespread social resistance to, and boycott of, the polio vaccine in India and Nigeria, respectively (<a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0379" title="LarsonHJ , CooperLZ , EskolaJ , KatzSL , RatzanS . Addressing the vaccine confidence gap. Lancet2011;378(9790):526-35.">Larson 2011</a>). Many of the findings of this review rely heavily on findings from these studies. It is possible that parentsâ views and practices regarding childhood vaccination were different in settings where these controversies occurred, compared to settings where they did not. </p> </section> <section id="CD013265-sec-0087"> <h3 class="title" id="CD013265-sec-0087">Limitations of the review</h3> <p>All of the studies included (and sampled) in our review were published in English, although various German and French studies were included at the fullâtext screening stage. The scarcity of studies identified from nonâanglophone countries may be partly attributble to the fact that we did not include regional databases as part of our search strategy (e.g. the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, LILACS; Biblioteca Regional de Medicina, BIREME; African Index Medicus). We also made the decision to only include studies published in languages spoken by the review authors, which meant that only articles in French, English, and German were eligible for inclusion. This decision was based on our use of a metaâethnographic approach, an interpretative synthesis methodology that depends upon an inâdepth and nuanced understanding of the meanings of complex conceptual data (see âLanguage translationâ for more details). Ultimately, the absence of studies from nonâanglophone countries means that we may have missed important findings of studies from cultural contexts where English is not the norm, a key limitation of our review. </p> <p>The volume of data included in the analysis meant that it was feasible for only one review author (SC) to lead the data analysis processes, albeit with regular discussion with, input, and verification from other review authors. We recognise that these processes are inherently interpretive: more than one review author undertaking these processes independently may have produced different interpretations and enhanced the exploration of alternative explanations. The volume of data also meant that, in the early stages of the analysis, we organised the data into preliminary broad themes which served as the basis for the translations. While this initial grouping was pragmatic, it may have constrained the emergence of new categories and interpretations during the subsequent translation and synthesis stages. Finally, based on our initial sense of a commonality in findings amongst studies in HICs and amongst those in LMICs, our analysis involved grouping the studies according to country income level. While this approach helped preserve one important aspect of context during the translation and synthesis processes, it may have also impacted on the overall interpretations of the synthesis. </p> </section> </section> </section> <div class="figures-list"> <div class="figure" id="CD013265-fig-0001"> <div> <p><a class="external" href="/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013265.pub2/media/CDSR/CD013265/urn:x-wiley:14651858:media:CD013265:CD013265-FIG-01" target="_blank"><b></b></a></p> </div><img alt="Conceptual richness 5âpoint scale (adapted from the typology of qualitative findings developed by Sandelowski 2007)" data-id="CD013265-fig-0001" src="/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013265.pub2/media/CDSR/CD013265/image_n/nCD013265-FIG-01.jpg"/> <div class="scolaris-modal-title">Figures and Tables - </div> <div class="figure-viewer-caption"> <div class="figure-label">Figure 1</div> <div class="figure-caption"> <p>Conceptual richness 5âpoint scale (adapted from the typology of qualitative findings developed by <a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0426" title="SandelowskiM , BarrosoJ .

These discourses understand health as individualised, and healthârelated risks and decisions as matters of individual choice and responsibility. Furthermore, these discourses suggest that being a âgoodâ and responsible person in the world means consistently assessing oneâs own, individual healthârelated risks, seeking and questioning evidence about such risks, proactively avoiding and managing such risks, and understanding that one is singularly accountable for the outcomes that ensue. Some parents experienced this worldview as in conflict with vaccination promotion messages, which tend to be informed by other types of discourses. The discourses underpinning vaccination promotion messages frequently emphasise generalised risk and safety statistics, claim that âdoctor knows bestâ, ask people to trust authorities and follow what they promote, and advocate for social responsibility and the health of the community. Parentsâ perceived tension between the discourses informing their own worldview and those of vaccination promotion messages led some to resist these messages and be less accepting of vaccination.Â  </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0112" title="RogersA , PilgrimD .

Social exclusion may involve economic disadvantage, residential segregation, a lack of political representation or power, discrimination and unequal protection of rights, and a myriad of socioeconomic barriers to good quality public services, including vaccination. Social exclusion weakened trustful governmentâcitizen relations, generated feelings of alienation from, and resentment towards, the state and others, and gave rise to frustration and demotivation in the face of structural challenges. These factors in turn led some parents who are socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, effort, (opportunity) costs and distress it creates. </p> </td> <td align="" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p><a href="./references#CD013265-bbs2-0097" title="LeachM , FairheadJ .
