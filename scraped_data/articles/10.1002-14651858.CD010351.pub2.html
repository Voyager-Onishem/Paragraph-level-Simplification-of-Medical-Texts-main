This resource may be underused as a health promotion tool to address the increasing burden of common health problems such as increased chronic diseases and mental health concerns. Outdoor environmental enhancement and conservation activities (EECA) (for instance unpaid litter picking, tree planting or path maintenance) offer opportunities for physical activity alongside greater connectedness with local environments, enhanced social connections within communities and improved self‐esteem through activities that improve the locality which may, in turn, further improve well‐being. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0002"> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0002">Objectives</h3> <p>To assess the health and well‐being impacts on adults following participation in environmental enhancement and conservation activities. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0003"> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0003">Search methods</h3> <p>We contacted or searched the websites of more than 250 EECA organisations to identify grey literature.

We searched the following databases (initially in October 2012, updated October 2014, except CAB Direct, OpenGrey, SPORTDiscus, and TRIP Database), using a search strategy developed with our project advisory groups (predominantly leaders of EECA‐type activities and methodological experts): ASSIA; BIOSIS; British Education Index; British Nursing Index; CAB Abstracts; Campbell Collaboration; Cochrane Public Health Specialized Register; DOPHER; EMBASE; ERIC; Global Health; GreenFILE; HMIC; MEDLINE‐in‐Process; MEDLINE; OpenGrey; PsychINFO; Social Policy and Practice; SPORTDiscus; TRoPHI; Social Services Abstracts; Sociological Abstracts; <i>The Cochrane Library</i>; TRIP database; and Web of Science.

Included studies examined the impact of EECA on adult health and well‐being. Eligible interventions needed to include each of the following: intended to improve the outdoor natural or built environment at either a local or wider level; took place in urban or rural locations in any country; involved active participation; and were NOT experienced through paid employment. </p> <p>We included quantitative and qualitative research. Includable quantitative study designs were: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, cluster quasi‐RCTs, controlled before‐and‐after studies, interrupted‐time‐series, cohort studies (prospective or retrospective), case‐control studies and uncontrolled before‐and‐after studies (uBA). We included qualitative research if it used recognised qualitative methods of data collection and analysis. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0005"> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0005">Data collection and analysis</h3> <p>One reviewer extracted data, and another reviewer checked the data. Two review authors independently appraised study quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool (for quantitative studies) or Wallace criteria (for qualitative studies). Heterogeneity of outcome measures and poor reporting of intervention specifics prevented meta‐analysis so we synthesised the results narratively. We synthesised qualitative research findings using thematic analysis. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0006"> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0006">Main results</h3> <p>Database searches identified 21,420 records, with 21,304 excluded at title/abstract. Grey literature searches identified 211 records. We screened 327 full‐text articles from which we included 21 studies (reported in 28 publications): two case‐studies (which were not included in the synthesis due to inadequate robustness), one case‐control, one retrospective cohort, five uBA, three mixed‐method (uBA, qualitative), and nine qualitative studies. The 19 studies included in the synthesis detailed the impacts to a total of 3,603 participants: 647 from quantitative intervention studies and 2630 from a retrospective cohort study; and 326 from qualitative studies (one not reporting sample size). </p> <p>Included studies shared the key elements of EECA defined above, but the range of activities varied considerably. Quantitative evaluation methods were heterogeneous. The designs or reporting of quantitative studies, or both, were rated as ‘weak’ quality with high risk of bias due to one or more of the following: inadequate study design, intervention detail, participant selection, outcome reporting and blinding. </p> <p>Participants’ characteristics were poorly reported; eight studies did not report gender or age and none reported socio‐economic status. Three quantitative studies reported that participants were referred through health or social services, or due to mental ill health (five quantitative studies), however participants' engagement routes were often not clear. </p> <p>Whilst the majority of quantitative studies (n = 8) reported no effect on one or more outcomes, positive effects were reported in six quantitative studies relating to short‐term physiological, mental/emotional health, and quality‐of‐life outcomes. Negative effects were reported in two quantitative studies; one study reported higher levels of anxiety amongst participants, another reported increased mental health stress. </p> <p>The design or reporting, or both, of the qualitative studies was rated as good in three studies or poor in nine; mainly due to missing detail about participants, methods and interventions. Included qualitative evidence provided rich data about the experience of participation. Thematic analysis identified eight themes supported by at least one good quality study, regarding participants' positive experiences and related to personal/social identity, physical activity, developing knowledge, spirituality, benefits of place, personal achievement, psychological benefits and social contact. There was one report of negative experiences. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0007"> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0007">Authors' conclusions</h3> <p>There is little quantitative evidence of positive or negative health and well‐being benefits from participating in EECA. However, the qualitative research showed high levels of perceived benefit among participants. Quantitative evidence resulted from study designs with high risk of bias, qualitative evidence lacked reporting detail. The majority of included studies were programme evaluations, conducted internally or funded by the provider. </p> <p>The conceptual framework illustrates the range of interlinked mechanisms through which people believe they potentially achieve health and well‐being benefits, such as opportunities for social contact. It also considers potential moderators and mediators of effect. </p> <p>One main finding of the review is the inherent difficulty associated with generating robust evidence of effectiveness for complex interventions. We developed the conceptual framework to illustrate how people believed they benefited. Investigating such mechanisms in a subsequent theory‐led review might be one way of examining evidence of effect for these activities. </p> <p>The conceptual framework needs further refinement through linked reviews and more reliable evidence. Future research should use more robust study designs and report key intervention and participant detail. </p> </section> </div> </section> <section class="pico-section" id="pico"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title">PICOs <i class="icon fa fa-info-circle" title="The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

A systematic review is a research method to identify, quality appraise and synthesise all relevant evidence about a particular topic. </p> <p>It is thought that contact with the natural environment has a positive impact on health and well‐being. For example, those living closer to green spaces have better mental health than those who don’t. Parks and countryside may also provide a place for healthy activities which can improve physical health. There is interest in understanding whether the natural environment can be a resource to improve public health. </p> <p><b>Methods</b>: We wanted to know if taking part in nature conservation, or other activities that enhance the environment (such as litter‐picking), can impact on health. The activities examined aimed to improve the outdoor environment in urban or rural locations. Participants were adult volunteers or were referred by a healthcare professional. </p> <p>We conducted a systematic review. We searched databases and contacted experts to identify all relevant academic and unpublished research (grey literature) from any country. </p> <p><b>Results</b>: We found 19 studies based on numerical data (quantitative) and text from interviews (qualitative). They came from the UK, US, Canada and Australia. </p> <p>The majority of quantitative studies reported no effect on health and well‐being. There was limited evidence that participation had positive effects on self‐reported health, quality of life and physical activity levels. Some also reported increased mental fatigue and greater feelings of anxiety. </p> <p>The qualitative studies illustrate the experiences of people taking part, and their perceptions of the benefits. People reported feeling better. They liked the opportunity for increased social contact, especially if they had been socially isolated through, for example, mental ill‐health. They also valued a sense of achievement, being in nature and provision of a daily structure. </p> <p><b>Limitations</b>: The results need to be treated with caution because the research methods used were not very robust and cannot show definitively that participation caused any health change. The quality of the research, in terms of study design and reporting, was low. </p> <p><b>Conclusions</b>: Given the quality of the evidence, we cannot draw any definite conclusions. More reliable research is needed to understand exactly how and why these activities may benefit health, and to assess whether they could be used as an effective health promotion tool. </p> </div> </section> <section id="vls" style="display: none"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title">Visual summary<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i></h2> </div> <a href="" target="_blank"><img alt="visual summary" src=""/></a> </section> <section class="conclusions"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD010351-sec-0136" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Authors' conclusions <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="authorsConclusions" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD010351-sec-0136"></div> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0137">Implications for practice</h3> <section id="CD010351-sec-0137"> <p>The evidence in this review is limited and somewhat conflicting; there is some indication that for some people participation in environmental enhancement or conservation activity impacts positively on health and well‐being, but also that some participants may experience increased mental strain. Any benefits are complex and not obvious; whilst often not central features of programmes, real benefits appear to be seen in the normalisation and daily structure of activities (which are task related) for some groups. </p> <p>The quality of the evidence base is one of the main findings of this review. There were a small number of studies which were of poor quality and often not well reported. Studies were mostly uncontrolled, and subject to high levels of bias, as well as often being conducted internally or funded by the provider. Qualitative studies were also of a low overall quality and lacked reporting detail. </p> <p>There was therefore insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about participation in specific activities by specific groups of individuals, but given the type and quantity of the evidence it is the potential mechanisms of action which were of most interest. The qualitative synthesis enhances understanding of the processes by which any effects might occur. This evidence suggested that individuals experiencing social isolation or mental ill health might gain greatest benefit. The social, structured nature of the enjoyable tasks was reported as being key for these individuals, rather than the health outcomes themselves. </p> <p>Projects engaging volunteers, or referrals, with EECA could therefore seek to maximise opportunities to enhance these pathways to maximise health impacts. Projects could also take into account the motivations of participants ‐ such as provision of day structure, and even attendance ‐ when formulating activities, and recognise that outcomes differ for differing groups. Additionally, for those referred groups, GPs and mental health workers might consider the appropriateness of referral in more cases given the outcomes identified as important, such as increased self‐esteem, social contact and day structure. </p> <p>More broadly, the mechanisms proposed in our conceptual framework (<a href="#CD010351-fig-0013">Figure 13</a>) (arising from the qualitative evidence base) might relate to activities which are not EECA focused. Any interventions which are group‐based, goal‐orientated and flexibly‐structured might also trigger many of these potential pathways to health. The framework also indicates potential intermediate outcomes that could be measured in future studies (i.e. sense of social contact) and the participants that would appreciate these. </p> </section> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0138">Implications for research</h3> <section id="CD010351-sec-0138"> <p>As noted above the evidence located was weak and future research should address the specific methodological problems which we have outlined. Evaluations of programmes should seek to use appropriate intervention study designs, such as randomised controlled designs, which would provide evidence of a causal link between participation and health impacts. Alternatively, realist approaches might elucidate what works, in what circumstances, for whom. Participants and controls should be selected from appropriate populations using rigorous sampling, interventions should be documented in detail and outcomes assessed over longer time scales using appropriate validated measures. Less reliance should be placed on self‐reported health and well‐being measures. </p> <p>As part of the output of this review we are working with our PRG to develop an evidence toolkit, which will take the form of a single page of recommendations for good practice based on the evidence collected and links to evaluation methods sources. </p> <p>Our conceptual model represents an illustration of the range of potential pathways through which EECA might influence health and well‐being. The wider applicability of the model needs further investigation, refinement and, ultimately, testing. We therefore recommend reviews into linked topics and groups including: </p> <p> <ul id="CD010351-list-0030"> <li> <p>gardening;</p> </li> <li> <p>farm‐care;</p> </li> <li> <p>horticulture therapy;</p> </li> <li> <p>school gardens; and</p> </li> <li> <p>Attention Restoration Therapy.</p> </li> </ul> </p> </section> </section> </section> <section class="background"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD010351-sec-0015" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Background <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="background" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD010351-sec-0015"></div> <section id="CD010351-sec-0016"> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0016">Description of the condition</h3> <p>There is growing research and policy interest in the potential of using the natural environment to enhance human health and well‐being (<a href="./references#CD010351-bbs2-0328" title="CapaldiC , DopkoR , ZelenskiJ .

We used only intervention terms in the strategy and used the search to identify both quantitative and qualitative evidence. The populations included were necessarily broad and we could not include terms to narrow the field. Similarly, included study designs prevented reduction by comparator group, as evidence was likely to exist which had single group samples. Grey literature and scoping searches had also highlighted the disparity in outcome labelling in this field, which prohibited the inclusion of outcome terms in the strategy. </p> <p>A year limit was applied, 1990‐current (last searches performed October 2014), which is the period in which environmental enhancement activities became widely recognised (the Green Gym project was developed in the late 1990s) and health impact research emerged. </p> <p>We did not limit our searches by country however we only included papers in English. While we recognise that there is a potential for bias to be introduced as a result of limiting the searches to English, the direction and degree of such bias is unknown. As outlined in the <i>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</i> (<a href="./references#CD010351-bbs2-0373" title="SterneJAC , EggerM , MoherD (editors) .

We began with a scoping stage of expert/stakeholder contact searching using web‐resources and speaking with organisations of relevance to identify unique or unpublished items (these organisations can be found in <a href="./appendices#CD010351-sec-0146">Appendix 4</a>). Items identified at this stage were entered into <a href="./references#CD010351-bbs2-0331" title="Thomson Reuters. Endnote. Version X5. New York: Thomson Reuters, 2011. ">Endnote 2011</a>. </p> <p>Pragmatically, our search for grey literature focused on UK organisations, who were contacted by telephone, and further contacts identified through snowballing, where existing contacts provided details of others. The requirement to discuss the project aims with contacts alongside the quantity of organisations in the field could not, realistically, be repeated globally. However we included evidence from non‐UK/European English‐speaking countries as far as possible, and searched international websites. </p> <p>Secondly, and again in development with the Project Reference Group, handsearching was conducted on the websites of relevant organisations, including non‐UK/European English‐speaking countries, a list of organisations identified can be found in <a href="./appendices#CD010351-sec-0147">Appendix 5</a>. We searched the sites using selected terms (see <a href="./appendices#CD010351-sec-0147">Appendix 5</a>) entered into website search boxes and a manual trawl of the first 100 results. If the first 100 results yielded a high level of includable items (i.e. &gt; 10%) then more hits were trawled. For websites where searches with a single term resulted in an excessive number of hits (for example the American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), terms were combined to return only relevant items.

All included studies reported on activities which fulfilled our criteria outlined in <a href="#CD010351-sec-0028">Types of interventions</a> (those which are all of the following: intended to improve the outdoor natural or built environment at either a local or wider level; take place in urban or rural locations; involve active participation; are entirely voluntary, or not; and are NOT experienced through paid employment), and so all came under the broad heading of EECA, however there was very limited reporting detail about the exact nature, scope, duration, and intensity of the interventions. Heterogeneity in the evaluation methodology used in the studies, and the relatively small total number of included studies, precluded subgroup analyses. </p> <p>Given the broad application of major theories (see <a href="#CD010351-sec-0039">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</a>), we could not undertake any meaningful grouping by theoretical background. </p> <p>Instead, we grouped studies by intervention intention; and sought to investigate differences in findings and participants descriptively through tabulating and comparing data from two groups of studies. We categorised some activities as “Green Gym” models (defined as a formalised programme of a activities intended to increase fitness and well‐being specifically through conservation) compared to the other models that did not explicitly have this distinct focus (for example, activities that were billed primarily as being about conservation). </p> <p>We also grouped studies by participation type, so that we could compare those individuals who were referred to the programme (for example through mental health services) and those who participated voluntarily. </p> </section> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0051"> <h4 class="title">Assessment of reporting biases</h4> <p>To counter the introduction of publication biases, we used three strategies. Firstly, searches included a comprehensive set of databases as identified by the Information Specialist (CC), and the search strategy was extensively discussed both within and outside the team to be as inclusive as possible. Secondly, two members of the review team (KH and RL) undertook grey literature searches and handsearching of relevant websites to identify unpublished reports and items which were location‐specific. Lastly, we contacted the Project Reference Group to identify unpublished literature (<a href="./appendices#CD010351-sec-0141">Appendix 1</a>). </p> <p>Identified research was subject to reporting bias: it was typically conducted by those also running the environmental enhancement/conservation activities, without formal research methods training, and it was not reported in the peer‐reviewed academic literature. Reported outcomes were not always complete (for example, only certain domains of the SF36) and were potentially based on post‐hoc decision making. It is therefore possible that negative or no‐effect results were under‐reported to some extent. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0052"> <h4 class="title">Data synthesis</h4> <section id="CD010351-sec-0053"> <h5 class="title">Quantitative studies</h5> <p>The included quantitative studies reported a range of different health and well‐being outcomes, which we grouped according to broad domain. The studies included did not allow for a formal meta‐analysis to establish pooled effect measures for the stated outcomes. Within broad outcome domains, specific outcome measures used were different and calculation of standardised effect estimates was not possible. </p> <p>Only the SF‐36 and the SF‐12 was used by more than one study included in the review. However, these were reported selectively, with studies reporting different domains of the scores. The only measures reported in more than one study were the physical component (PCS‐12) and mental component (MCS‐12) scores of SF‐12, and the physical component (PCS‐36), mental component (MCS‐36), total scores, social domain scores for SF‐36. However, the two studies reporting PCS‐12 and MCS‐12 did not report standard deviations (SD) or raw data, while all three studies reporting SF‐36 contained fewer than 20 participants and so were not considered reliable enough to meta‐analyse. </p> <p>We therefore summarised effectiveness results narratively. The synthesis reports outcomes grouped by category (physiological, quality of life etc.) and tabulates results for all studies reporting measures of this outcome category, which we also described narratively in the text. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0054"> <h5 class="title">Qualitative studies</h5> <p>Three review authors (KH, RG and RL) independently read and undertook thematic analysis of the qualitative studies included in the synthesis, to provide a comprehensive picture of the range of themes and concepts available across the studies, as well as commonalities between study findings. Through reading and re‐reading the text, we developed a coding frame, which identified nine themes describing people’s experiences of participating in EECA and how they thought they were affected by participation. </p> <p>After we had conducted the thematic synthesis, we used the qualitative findings to create and refine our conceptual framework which tried to elucidate how people thought that health and well‐being outcomes could be attained. This framework expresses how interventions may result in multiple health and well‐being impacts (see <a href="#CD010351-sec-0090">Effects of interventions</a>), we developed it through discussion among the review team and with the advisory groups about the findings from the evidence syntheses. We devised it using data from qualitative studies and it illustrates the mechanisms of action through which it is believed that involvement in environmental enhancement activities produces health and well‐being effects. In addition it illustrates the various factors (again derived from the qualitative evidence) that could mediate or moderate the mechanisms through which outcomes may occur, and the outcomes themselves. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0055"> <h5 class="title">Pooling quantitative evidence: controlled study designs</h5> <p>Although we identified two studies using controlled designs, they were of different study design and used different study outcomes so were unsuitable for pooling. </p> <p>One case‐control study (<a href="./references#CD010351-bbs2-0018" title="MooreM , TownsendM , OldroydJ .

The analysis of this data undertaken by researchers represents the way in which they have interpreted participants’ expressions of experience, and these are sometimes called 'second order constructs'. Qualitative analysis exists on a continuum, with descriptive findings being closest to the data, and representing the least transformation from it, and interpretive explanations of the data being furthest from the data, or most transformed through analysis (<a href="./references#CD010351-bbs2-0370" title="SandelowskiM , BarrosoJ .

Where qualitative analysis is descriptive, the work of the researchers represents more of an ordering and describing, rather than representing any deeper conceptualisation or theorising. In these cases, the first and second order constructs are often broadly similar. In this review, the included qualitative research was largely descriptive in nature. Since first and second order constructs were similar, they can be synthesised together using thematic analysis, and we have reported participants’ quotes to retain the immediacy and authenticity of participants’ voices. </p> <p>We imported findings from included qualitative studies into Microsoft Excel for coding.

The limitations in the quantitative evidence, in terms of extent, quality and consistency in outcome measures, prevented us from exploring heterogeneity statistically. Analysis of the qualitative research was also sensitive to these potentially important study contexts.

Using logic models to capture complexity in systematic reviews. Research Synthesis Methods2011;2:33‐42. ">Anderson 2011</a>). Further details can be seen in the <a href="#CD010351-sec-0120">Discussion</a> section of this report. The framework represents the reviewers’ attempt to graphically illustrate participants' perceptions (through qualitative evidence included in the review) to understand how participation in EECA might lead to health and well‐being impacts. These are sometimes referred to as mechanisms of action, or programme theories. </p> <p>The framework, expressed as a conceptual model, represents the range of potential pathways through which EECA might impact on health and well‐being. The model is not specific to any particular population as it tries to capture the possible pathways that any individual may experience; indeed, individuals may follow different pathways for different events in which they participate, and their experience may change over time. It is designed to illustrate that certain factors, such as motivations, the place in which the activity takes place and the purpose of the activity, could affect the types of outcomes achieved. We derived the model from included qualitative evidence and the review authors' interpretations. We sought the input of the Project Reference Group at two stages in the development of this framework. </p> <p>We developed the first iteration of the model in the summer of 2012, through a reading of the literature and the first PRG meeting, and we outlined the ways in which it appeared that participation in environmental enhancement and conservation activities could potentially impact on physical, mental and emotional well‐being. The development from this to the final version is described in the <a href="#CD010351-sec-0120">Discussion</a>). </p> </section> </section> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0060"> <h4 class="title">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</h4> <p>This review aimed to draw out the interacting effects between mechanisms, outcomes and sub‐groups, however this was limited by poor reporting and equivocal findings. As there was insufficient compatible data to investigate these statistically, we tried to explore possible differences using tabulation according to group factors, and juxtapose findings by various study and population characteristics. We also tried to capture the possible differences through illustrating potential mediator and moderator effects in the conceptual framework. </p> <p>Study findings were initially grouped based on outcome. Subsequently we grouped based on the route to participation (i.e. voluntary or referred), and also inclusion of formalised 'branded' programmes (Green Gym and Landcare) versus less formalised programmes. </p> <p>We investigated the impact of different types of programmes (e.g. woodland maintenance vs. path creation) and different contexts (e.g. urban setting vs. rural or woodland vs. coastal), however there was insufficient data to assess these characteristics as mediating variables. </p> <p>We also wanted to explore potential impacts on specific subgroups; such as those with mental ill health or older people, and also explored socio‐economic differences where data allowed. Initial exploration of the grey literature and scoping searches indicated that there was potential for levels of health inequality to be perpetuated across those from lower socio‐economic backgrounds and those with mental ill health. As such, these two groups were prioritised in our tabulations of study findings by subgroup. </p> </section> </section> </section> </section> <section class="results"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD010351-sec-0061" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Results <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="results" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD010351-sec-0061"></div> <section id="CD010351-sec-0062"> <h3 class="title">Description of studies</h3> <p>See: <a href="./references#CD010351-sec-0159" title="">Characteristics of included studies</a>; <a href="./references#CD010351-sec-0160" title="">Characteristics of excluded studies</a>. </p> <section id="CD010351-sec-0063"> <h4 class="title">Results of the search</h4> <p>The combined number of hits resulting from the database searches (completed in October 2012 and updated in October 2014), grey literature searches (conducted in September 2012) and citation chases, was 21,631. Two reviewers (KH and RL) independently carried out initial screening of titles and abstracts to remove clearly irrelevant studies, after which 327 items were considered to be potentially includable. Two reviewers independently assessed the full texts and excluded 297 items (see <a href="./references#CD010351-sec-0160" title="">Characteristics of excluded studies</a>). </p> <p>We found 21 studies which met the inclusion criteria of the review.

We assumed that the actual nature, frequency and intensity of the activities were likely to vary between deliverers, sessions and locations. This would have been the case both for badged activities like the 'Green Gym' and other volunteering activities. There is no indication that, for example 'Green Gym' activities would have been the same for all sessions running under this name. Indeed this may not be desirable, as part of the appeal of the Green Gym may be that varied activities were offered and that they were responsive to individual ability and local need. Individual participants attending the same session may have been more or less involved in different aspects which may have led to varying experiences between participants, including different levels of physical activity or skills gained. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0086"> <h4 class="title">Analyses</h4> <p>The papers provided few details about the approach to analysis, however most of the analyses were descriptive.

This, together with lack of comparative study designs and poor reporting of sample characteristics, precluded subgroup analyses. </p> <p>We found little quantitative evidence of positive or negative effects of participation in environmental enhancement and conservation activity, for any measured outcome. There was limited evidence of positive effect on outcomes in some studies, as well as some (also limited) evidence of negative effects. Most outcomes, however, were not statistically significant or were inconsistent. Of those few studies that did report statistically significant findings, none used both a controlled study design and objectively measured outcomes. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0123"> <h4 class="title">Qualitative evidence findings and limitations</h4> <p>The qualitative research also suffered from inadequate reporting of key details such as sample characteristics and recruitment methods. </p> <p>The qualitative evidence provided rich descriptions of the perceived potential mechanisms of effect (i.e. how benefits were thought to accrue), as well as participant motivations and experiences of taking part in EECA. The qualitative findings focused more on the potential pathways to health and well‐being rather than on actual impact in terms of outcomes; although physical and mental health was directly discussed in a small number of studies. We identified ten themes in the qualitative data, describing the experience of EECA and perceived routes to health and well‐being benefit. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0124"> <h4 class="title">Limitations relevant to both quantitative and qualitative evidence</h4> <p>The evidence base, quantitative and qualitative, was almost entirely located in grey literature, so a significant proportion of the studies were not academic, peer‐reviewed studies. Such programme evaluations may not be as methodologically rigorous as peer‐reviewed studies and may also be subject to increased levels of reporting bias, which has implications for our ability to make claims about the impacts of participation in EECA. </p> <p>In addition, such studies were potentially subject to conflicts of interest. The majority of included studies (10/19, 53%) appeared to be funded or supported by organisations promoting the use or protection, or both, of the natural environment, and three were written by authors working for the organisation providing the intervention. Two authors appear as authors or co‐authors on six of the included studies. There were no studies where the funder was both known and unlikely to have a potential conflict of interest. The prevalence of such internal evaluations is due to the limited resources, both time and financial, available to researchers in this field and the relative infancy of the field itself. The primary aim of much of the research conducted was as an internal evaluation of the programme. As no studies were included which were assessed as free from this potential bias we were unable to assess the impact on results. </p> <p>All the interventions met our inclusion criteria provided in <a href="#CD010351-sec-0028">Types of interventions</a>, however there was insufficient reporting detail to allow exploration of findings by intervention specifics. </p> <p>The activities explored in the research were predominantly rural, in open countryside, woodland, nature reserves, with some urban based projects.

Some participated in activities as volunteers and some participants had been referred onto programmes. A number of studies included participants who had, or were currently experiencing mental ill health. One study included offenders. </p> <p>The use of theory in included studies was inconsistent and was often applied uncritically. Grouping of study findings by theoretical background was not possible, however the less formal lay theories (programme theories articulated by participants and activity organisers) helped develop our conceptual framework. The conceptual framework illustrates the range of interlinked mechanisms through which people believe they have potential to achieve the health and well‐being benefits of EECA, such as enhanced opportunities for social contact. It also considers potential moderators and mediators of effect, such as participant motivation, or nature of activities. </p> <section id="CD010351-sec-0125"> <h5 class="title">Conceptual framework</h5> <p>A key outcome of our synthesis was the development of a conceptual framework to illustrate the proposed ways through which health benefits might be accrued by taking part in conservation activities. To develop this framework, we used the participants' perceptions from qualitative studies, the authors’ interpretations of the overall evidence, the programme theories described in the studies and input from both reference groups. Our initial conceptual framework was refined through this input (see <a href="#CD010351-sec-0052">Data synthesis</a>). </p> <p>The evidence collected supported differing ways to well‐being, linking with barriers, facilitators, and outcomes through interventions, thus the first iteration of the model provided a good base. Studies included in the review indicated that it was lacking in both detail and structural nuance, however. Detail, in that each set of characteristics (well‐being features, barriers, facilitators, outcomes) needed extension and amendment through detailed thinking. Structure, in that the linearity of the original model did not represent the cyclical, somewhat complex nature of intervention effect reported (i.e. feedback loops and process outcomes). Therefore, during the synthesis, we revised and extended all aspects of this draft model. We devised a new framework that emerged from the qualitative evidence base. We used all studies to inform about participant characteristics and range of activities as a way to understand what possible moderators and mediators might be (a version with study identifiers populating our links can be seen here: <a href="http://wp.me/p31J6p-6C" target="_blank">http://wp.me/p31J6p‐6C</a>). Our initial model was an expression of the project reference groups' discussion of the most likely mechanisms and impacts prior to the review, and so the second phase is also an illustration about how plausible theories in this field are or are not substantiated by empirical evidence. </p> <p>The final version is shown in <a href="#CD010351-fig-0013">Figure 13</a>. The model represents the authors’ interpretation of the overall data and is intended to represent the range of potential pathways through which health impacts may come about. It is also an illustration about how plausible theories are or are not supported by empirical evidence. Emphasis was placed on the presence of mechanisms rather than on the evidential strength which, given the types and quality of the evidence available, seemed most applicable. Further, the model does not represent commonality between the studies. This version was designed in conjunction with a data visualisation specialist (WST), and circulated amongst the two advisory groups for further comments. </p> <div class="figure" id="CD010351-fig-0013"> <div class="figure-caption-wrapper-top"> <nav class="inline-nav-list has-dividers"> <ul> <li><a class="open-in-figure-viewer" href="#0">Open in figure viewer</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class="figure-label">Figure 13</div> </div> <hr class="top"/><img alt="Final conceptual framework (Qualitative Synthesis: Proposed Links Between Conservation Activities and Health Outcomes), representing potential health and wellbeing impacts from participation in EECA." data-id="CD010351-fig-0013" src="/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010351.pub2/media/CDSR/CD010351/image_n/nCD010351-AFig-FIG13.png"/><hr class="bottom"/> <div class="figure-caption-wrapper-bottom"> <div class="figure-caption"> <p>Final conceptual framework (Qualitative Synthesis: Proposed Links Between Conservation Activities and Health Outcomes), representing <i>potential</i> health and wellbeing impacts from participation in EECA. </p> </div> </div> </div> <p>The model proposes the range of pathways through which health and well‐being impacts may come about following participation in environmental enhancement and conservation activities; it tries to capture a programme theory (i.e. how it is believed that health and well‐being impacts may come about through participation in EECA). It also shows aspects relating to participants and activity types that may cause variation in the mechanisms or the outcomes experienced, or both. </p> <p>In the model, “moderators” refers to factors which the qualitative evidence suggested might influence the extent to which outcomes or mechanisms are experienced by participants. Three types of moderators were identified as of potential importance; first, the mechanisms of action; second, the environment in which an activity is undertaken (e.g. rural vs urban); and third, those that related to the types of activity itself (e.g. who it was undertaken with, and for what purpose). </p> <p>“Personal mediators” refer to those factors, such as personal expectations and physical ability, which the qualitative evidence suggested were potentially of relevance and which may influence the outcomes. We placed motivation separately because it emerged as a key factor as to how people approach and potentially benefit from the programme. </p> <p>The pathway shown in the model in a dark red colour (spirituality) is only thought to influence mental health, while the orange/brown pathways are those that might influence both mental health or social function, or both, and the orange pathways might influence any or all of the three outcomes. </p> <p>It should be noted that there is no evidence of tangible health impacts for six months following participation in EECA from all available evaluations. As noted above, self‐selection of participants introduces high levels of bias into all included quantitative and qualitative studies, and so what is presented is also subject to these possible biases. The model is built from a small body of heterogenous evidence, the majority of which was rated as 'poor' (all but three of the qualitative studies). Therefore, the model does not illustrate proven pathways to impact, rather the range of potential ways in which participation may impact on health. It shows how participants in the studies believed they were deriving benefit from the activities in which they were involved and that factors that could influence the nature and extent of the effects. </p> <p>The model tries to capture complexity, and is not specific to any particular population. Instead it is designed to illustrate that factors such as a person’s motivation, the place in which the activity takes place and the purpose of the activity could affect the types of outcomes achieved. Some of these outcomes are particularly difficult to measure, such as confidence or spirituality, and no evidence of effect was reported in quantitative studies. This could be because there is no effect, but may also relate to the studies being small and of poor quality, or even because the wrong outcomes were measured. </p> <p>The health related ‘outcomes’ in the model are broadly those that we stated we would assess in the review protocol. The circularity of the model is used to demonstrate that participation is likely to be a process over time subject to variation and feedback loops and, therefore, any outcomes, or processes possibly leading to outcomes, are neither strictly linear nor independent of each other. An example of a feedback loop was identified in the qualitative evidence which suggested that increased social contact led to improvement in a participant’s confidence which resulted in further opportunities for social contact, ability to take on leadership roles and so on. </p> <p>The 'mechanisms of change/process outcomes' were derived from the qualitative evidence and demonstrate some of the proposed pathways through which the health‐related outcomes appear to be related to the environmental enhancement and conservation activities. Many of the process outcomes could also be considered to be important potential impacts. For example, increased opportunities for physical activity may lead to improved physical and mental well‐being, but is also a desirable process outcome in itself. The mechanisms of change and process outcomes are broad categories and many have several sub‐themes that it was not possible to show on the model. </p> </section> </section> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0126"> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0126">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</h3> <section id="CD010351-sec-0127"> <h4 class="title">Completeness</h4> <section id="CD010351-sec-0128"> <h5 class="title">Quantitative studies</h5> <p>We found evidence relating to all of the outcome groups described in the protocol apart from physical health, and we grouped outcomes according to broad domain.

From what we can ascertain from the poor reporting of intervention specifics only two activities that we anticipated finding evidence on, were not examined; 1) litter picking and 2) re‐greening in built environments. Whilst we identified studies which included these specific activities and which were methodologically includable (see <a href="./references#CD010351-bbs2-0032" title="AustinME .

The socio‐demographics of the participants were poorly reported. Where reporting allowed for an assessment it appeared that the studies considered a range of groups, including conservation volunteers, retired people, people in receipt of support from the social and health services, environmental tourists and men leaving the prison system. </p> <p>We were unable to perform formal sub‐group analyses because of the poorly reported studies, heterogeneity in outcome, and selective use of measures. Included studies often provided an age breakdown for included individuals, but outcomes were not reported for separate groups.

The qualitative evidence from these studies greatly increased the completeness of the review; the consideration of how people experienced participation revealed the underlying mechanisms through which participants felt EECA impacted on their health and well‐being. These studies provided evidence that addressed the differing ways in which particular groups might derive benefit from participation. </p> <p>Overall, the quantitative and qualitative evidence we located addressed the majority of the categories of outcome, intervention and participant which we had anticipated. However we were unable to differentiate between sub‐groups, activities and outcomes. This limited the completeness of the review and impacted on the conclusion we were able to draw. </p> </section> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0132"> <h4 class="title">Applicability</h4> <p>As discussed previously, whilst meeting our inclusion criteria, the studies were heterogeneous (activity specifics, outcomes and measures) and poorly reported. This has prevented us from drawing any firm conclusions about the impact of particular activities on particular groups of people. In this developing field there is a need for methodologically rigorous and comprehensively reported studies in order to assess fully the effects of different interventions. </p> <p>Where reporting allowed assessment, it appeared that outcome data were collected immediately following a period of participation in EECA (see <a href="#CD010351-sec-0077">Risk of bias in included studies</a>). We were therefore unable to conclude how durable the impacts of EECA may be, further limiting the applicability of the findings. </p> <p>The qualitative evidence synthesis indicated that socially excluded groups were those who potentially accrued greatest benefit from EECA and so it is perhaps these groups to which the findings of the review are particularly applicable. Features of interventions highlighted by these groups as addressing key health and social problems (e.g. daily structure, employability skills, social contact) are therefore potentially of use in programmes addressing health inequalities more broadly. Indeed, the rich descriptions of the mechanisms provided by participants in included studies demonstrated the need for careful consideration of process outcomes and outcomes in any study addressing equity issues. </p> <p>The types of conservation and environmental enhancement activities that were addressed in the included studies (see <a href="#CD010351-sec-0028">Types of interventions</a>) share commonalities with those of related projects and programmes such as communal gardening and urban re‐greening. It is feasible that the impacts of EECA and the programme theory, shown in the conceptual framework, may be applicable to these other related types of activities. The mechanisms of action which may be common to these other programmes include physical activity, being in nature, gaining skills, being away from stressors, and undertaking a communal, goal‐orientated and rewarding activity. </p> <p>Finally it should be noted that the evidence base was limited to English‐speaking, largely Western nations and so there is potentially limited applicability to other global communities. </p> </section> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0133"> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0133">Quality of the evidence</h3> <p>Please refer to <a href="#CD010351-sec-0077">Risk of bias in included studies</a> for a summary. A detailed risk of bias table for each included study is provided in <a href="./references#CD010351-sec-0159" title="">Characteristics of included studies</a>. </p> <p>All quantitative studies were rated as weak. The primary reason studies were considered to be of poor quality was a lack of reported detail. For example, it was often impossible to tell how participants had been selected or what activity was undertaken. Selection bias was a central problem for all studies; certain projects noted the difficulty in keeping people enrolled (e.g. <a href="./references#CD010351-bbs2-0005" title="British Trust for Conservation Volunteers(BTCV) . Wellbeing Comes Naturally: Year One Report. Doncaster: BTCV, 2010. ">BTCV 2010a</a>). It is likely that samples were therefore biased towards those who voluntarily completed the programmes (i.e. those most committed) experiencing benefits. </p> <p>Quantitative evidence used less robust study designs, being mostly uBAs, and even in those with stronger designs the comparator or control selection was either unclear or not rigorously conducted. Follow‐up periods, where data was supplied, were largely the length of the intervention, typically between three and six months, and so we could not draw any conclusions about the sustained effect of participation. </p> <p>A further issue which affected the assessment of the reliability of the studies was the publication of results from a single study in more than one location. Results were often written up in part across a number of papers and had to be located and collated into a single data extraction. Lack of clarity in reporting participants and methods made this task difficult. </p> <p>Overall, the quality of the included quantitative evidence was relatively weak. We did not find any randomised controlled evidence, and the majority of included quantitative studies were uBAs, limiting the resulting findings to associations between EECA and health and well‐being. We could not uncover any causal processes, nor could we unpick the contributory factors to the observed outcomes (e.g. time spent in the outdoors, social contact, or of the actual activities themselves). All included quantitative studies suffered from detection bias as participants could not be blinded to the intervention. </p> <p>The qualitative evidence was also weak, with three rated as 'good' (<a href="./references#CD010351-bbs2-0007" title="CaissieLT , HalpennyEA .

Given the prevalence throughout Europe of English as the primary language of scientific publication it is likely that this is because EECA is simply not undertaken to the same extent as in the UK (also suggested by one of the referees for the protocol for this review). </p> <p>We conducted searches in October 2012 and updated them in October 2014. We did not conduct any further searches due to financial and time constraints. We were unable to search CAB Direct, OpenGrey, SPORTDiscus, and TRIP Database in update searches (conducted in October 2014) due to changes in institutional access. Our searches were biased toward the UK, this was due to the resource costs of direct contact with organisations. We were realistically unable to replicate this level of contact outside the UK (despite comprehensive top‐level website trawls) and this is, we believe, reflected in the location of studies by country of origin. This, combined with the lack of evidence located in the database searches, means that an element of bias towards UK organisational reports is introduced. We accept that there is likely to be significant evidence from elsewhere in the world which is not included. </p> <p>Our approach to identifying grey literature, largely completed through telephone conversations and web searches, was unusual but particularly useful in gaining information. We could not realistically have reproduced this process across multiple countries, and certainly not across multiple languages. </p> <p>The poor reporting and unpublished nature of many studies relating to EECA meant that we excluded a number of potentially eligible studies due to lack of the specific information (in relation to the location and specifics of activities, methodologies etc.) necessary to clarify whether they met the inclusion criteria. We tried to contact authors and source further data in relation to these potentially includable studies. </p> <p>Given the complexity of the interventions and outcomes, the equivocal nature of the results of studies, and despite applying a language search limit, we feel that the results of the review were unlikely to have been different and would have reflected the complexity and uncertainty in the identified evidence base. </p> </section> <section id="CD010351-sec-0135"> <h3 class="title" id="CD010351-sec-0135">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</h3> <p>To our knowledge there are no systematic reviews which examine the impact of environmental enhancement and conservation activities on health and well‐being in adults. We are unable to draw firm conclusions from the evidence collected, however we feel that existing primary studies examining EECA overstate the evidence base and discuss promising but unproven mechanisms, something which we recommend extending below. </p> </section> </section> </section> <div class="figures-list"> <div class="figure" id="CD010351-fig-0001"> <div> <p><a class="external" href="/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010351.pub2/media/CDSR/CD010351/urn:x-wiley:14651858:media:CD010351:CD010351-AFig-FIG01" target="_blank"><b></b></a></p> </div> <div> <p><a class="external" href="/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010351.pub2/media/CDSR/CD010351/image_t/tCD010351-AFig-FIG01.png" target="_blank"><b></b></a></p> </div><img alt="Study Flow diagram." data-id="CD010351-fig-0001" src="/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010351.pub2/media/CDSR/CD010351/image_n/nCD010351-AFig-FIG01.png"/> <div class="scolaris-modal-title">Figures and Tables -
