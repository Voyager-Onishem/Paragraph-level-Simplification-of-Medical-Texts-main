People after cancer have been found to have higher rates of other conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other cancers. It is therefore sensible for people after cancer to look at changing their diet. It was important to undertake this review to assess the evidence on dietary advice for people who have survived cancer. </p> <p><b>Aim of the review</b><br/> This review evaluates evidence on dietary interventions for people after cancer. </p> <p><b>Quality of evidence</b><br/> The quality of evidence is generally low to very low. Most studies did not evaluate dietary interventions for key review outcomes, particularly mortality and morbidity. However, a few study outcomes with moderate‐certainty evidence focused on dietary intake and physical measurements. Included studies compared dietary interventions versus control or usual care. We pooled data from similar randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide a summary estimate of the effects of an intervention, and we judged how confident (certain) we were of these findings by using an established method (GRADE). </p> <p><b>Main findings</b><br/> We identified 25 RCTs involving 27 different comparisons. For some outcomes, we found absence of evidence for dietary interventions. We found some evidence showing that dietary interventions probably did not modify energy intake; however, some evidence shows what is probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake (moderate‐certainty evidence<i>)</i> . Evidence on dietary fibre was mixed for different advice on weight reducing or healthy eating. Dietary interventions compared to control probably improved the Diet Quality Index (moderate‐certainty evidence<i>)</i> . For physical measurements, we found a probable reduction in body mass index (BMI) with dietary interventions compared to controls (moderate‐certainty evidence) but little evidence showing any change in waist‐to‐hip ratio (low‐certainty evidence<i>)</i>. For quality of life (QoL), results were mixed due to the wide variety of tools used. No adverse events were reported. </p> <p><b>Conclusion</b><br/> Available evidence shows that dietary interventions can be helpful in modifying fruit and vegetable servings and diet quality; modification of fibre intake was variable, and some benefits were seen for anthropometric measurements, including BMI. Most of the evidence is based on women with breast cancer, so more research is needed for patients with other cancers. Gaps identified in the evidence involved the use of new technologies, comorbidities, and body composition data. </p> </div> </section> <section id="vls" style="display: none"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title">Visual summary<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i></h2> </div> <a href="" target="_blank"><img alt="visual summary" src=""/></a> </section> <section class="conclusions"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD011287-sec-0160" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Authors' conclusions <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> <div class="section-language-toggles"> <span class="section-languages-legend">available in</span> <nav class="section-languages"> <li class="section-language"> <a class="is-active" href="full/en#CD011287-sec-0160">English</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/es#CD011287-sec-0241">Español</a> </li> </nav> </div> </div> <section class="authorsConclusions" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD011287-sec-0160"></div> <h3 class="title" id="CD011287-sec-0161">Implications for practice</h3> <section id="CD011287-sec-0161"> <p>Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that dietary interventions can modify food and nutrient intakes and can positively affect some anthropometric measurements, particularly for women after breast cancer. Outcomes that showed evidence of some probable improvement were intake of fruits and vegetables and diet quality. Energy intake was not shown to be affected by dietary interventions. Body mass index was probably slightly reduced with dietary interventions. Lack of evidence from one included study suggests that dietary interventions improve overall mortality, and we found no evidence on the effects of dietary interventions on morbidities. Short‐term changes in dietary intake and in anthropometric measurements were not always shown to be sustained over a longer period. </p> <p>In relation to quality of life (QoL), we are uncertain about study results.</p> <p>Included studies described some positive benefits of dietary intervention for cancer survivors, although inconsistencies between included studies suggest that people may benefit differently from dietary interventions in terms of alterations in dietary intake and anthropometry, depending on type of cancer, nutritional status, and regular eating habits. </p> <p>Different personnel administered the dietary interventions, but dietitians did so in most studies. It is important to note that training and appropriate understanding are required when dietary interventions are provided to people who have survived cancer. Some studies described in detail the behaviour change strategies used, and it is important to note that as modifications to dietary intake represent a behaviour change, it is essential to incorporate these behaviours into dietary interventions used in practice. </p> </section> <h3 class="title" id="CD011287-sec-0162">Implications for research</h3> <section id="CD011287-sec-0162"> <p>Implications for future research include the following.</p> <p>We identified 26 ongoing studies that are relevant to this review, including 11 studies on breast cancer, three on colorectal cancer, three on gynaecological cancer, and nine on mixed cancer types, indicating that this area is developing rapidly. Studies are now being undertaken to examine previously neglected cancer sites. In addition, long‐term follow‐up data on participants already randomised into cohorts are being reported, adding to the evidence base as studies mature. </p> <p>Evidence in some areas is incomplete or lacking, and further research is required, including evaluation of dietary interventions for participants with cancer at sites other than the breast. These tumour sites could include colorectal or endometrial cancer, where a link has been established between occurrences and either dietary intake or obesity, making these important areas for future research. Moreover, a number of large ongoing studies recruiting participants with colorectal cancer will add substantially to the evidence. </p> <p>In relation to measurement of outcomes, we found a lack of data on body composition when routinely available imaging was used to evaluate changes in body composition. Use of mobile or digital applications to deliver interventions was limited, and this may well be an approach that will facilitate delivery of dietary interventions in the future. Developing outcomes that make use of digital technologies and routine imaging in assessment of dietary interventions would add to future research. No studies in this review included comorbidities as an outcome measure, and this is a huge reason why modifying dietary intake studies that include comorbidities as an outcome would enhance findings in future research. </p> <p>We identified some high‐quality studies, although not all trials followed <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/" target="_blank">CONSORT</a> guidelines and could be improved in relation to quality and standards of reporting. There were only a few studies that attempted to blind assessors; this would be a feasible way to decrease risk of bias in future research. </p> <p>This review is focused on survivors who were enrolled into studies after all treatments were completed, so it would be interesting to undertake further review of dietary interventions in patients who are living with cancer, particularly in light of the advancement of biological agents and hormone therapies used in prostate, breast, and gynaecological cancers. The optimal time to administer dietary interventions for healthy eating within cancer pathways for all cancer sites is a topic that remains controversial, as different studies included participants at different time points after their cancer treatment. Determining the optimal time to deliver dietary interventions is therefore worthy of further research. </p> <p>Studies investigating dietary interventions and changes in anthropometrics need long‐term follow‐up to identify differences in clinical outcomes including mortality and morbidity. This is often difficult due to the resource implications of conducting studies with long‐term follow‐up. The use of surrogate markers as early indicators for tumour recurrence may offer an advantage in studies where cancer recurrence is an important outcome in the evaluation of dietary interventions.

Evidence on dietary interventions for survivors of cancer is now developing, so it is timely to review the literature to summarise the research, to inform clinical practice and policy development, and to identify gaps in the literature for further research. </p> </section> </section> </section> <section class="objectives"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD011287-sec-0063" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Objectives <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> <div class="section-language-toggles"> <span class="section-languages-legend">available in</span> <nav class="section-languages"> <li class="section-language"> <a class="is-active" href="full/en#CD011287-sec-0063">English</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/es#CD011287-sec-0198">Español</a> </li> </nav> </div> </div> <section class="objectives" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD011287-sec-0063"></div> <p>To assess the effects of dietary interventions for adult cancer survivors on morbidity and mortality, changes in dietary behaviour, body composition, health‐related quality of life, and clinical measurements. </p> </section> </section> <section class="methods"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD011287-sec-0064" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Methods <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> <div class="section-language-toggles"> <span class="section-languages-legend">available in</span> <nav class="section-languages"> <li class="section-language"> <a class="is-active" href="full/en#CD011287-sec-0064">English</a> </li> <li class="section-language"> <a class="" href="full/es#CD011287-sec-0199">Español</a> </li> </nav> </div> </div> <section class="methods" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD011287-sec-0064"></div> <section id="CD011287-sec-0065"> <h3 class="title">Criteria for considering studies for this review</h3> <section id="CD011287-sec-0066"> <h4 class="title">Types of studies</h4> <p>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs published in peer‐reviewed journals that compared a dietary intervention versus a control consisting of no intervention or written information. </p> </section> <section id="CD011287-sec-0067"> <h4 class="title">Types of participants</h4> <p>All adult cancer survivors, defined as those who have lived beyond a cancer diagnosis that occurred after the age of 18 years and have completed all active anti‐cancer interventions, such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy.

For each study, these factors have been outlined in <a href="#CD011287-tbl-0002">Table 1</a>. Studies recorded dietary intake in different ways; some reported energy intake and nutrients, and others reported food groups or scales. In the results, we report dietary intake using energy intake, fruit servings per day, vegetable servings per day, fruit and vegetable servings per day in combination, fibre intake, and Diet Quality Index. The way dietary intake was recorded varied between studies, as did the methods of assessing dietary intake. Assessment methods included food diaries that were monitored by participants, three‐day diet recalls, diet history questionnaires, food frequency questionnaires, and three‐day diet diaries. All dietary assessment methods used are recorded in <a href="#CD011287-tbl-0002">Table 1</a>. Dietary intake was also reported over differing lengths of time; these are shown in <a href="#CD011287-tbl-0002">Table 1</a>. Due to lack of standardised methods of recording and assessing dietary intake, only a few studies could be incorporated into meta‐analyses, so we have given a narrative summary of results when appropriate. </p> <div class="table" id="CD011287-tbl-0002"> <table><a class="open-table-viewer open-in-figure-viewer" href="#0">Open in table viewer</a><div class="table-heading"><span class="table-label">Table 1.</span> <span class="table-title">Characteristics of dietary interventions, outcomes, and length of follow‐up</span></div> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Author and date</p> </td> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Personnel providing dietary intervention</p> </td> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Description of intervention</p> </td> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Method of dietary assessment</p> </td> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Frequency of contact</p> </td> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Outcomes recorded</p> </td> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Follow‐up length</p> </td> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Nutritional status at recruitment</p> </td> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Behavioural change therapy</p> </td> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p>Control or comparison group</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign=""> <p><a href="./references#CD011287-bbs2-0001" title="BefortCA , KlempJR , FabianC , PerriMG , SullivanDK , SchmitzKH , et al.

Most participants were women with breast cancer; we found a small amount of research on colorectal, prostate, and gynaecological cancer survivors. The evidence was very mixed overall for reported outcomes (mortality, dietary intake, anthropometry, quality of life, and biochemistry). See <a href="./full#CD011287-tbl-0001">summary of findings Table for the main comparison</a>. The main findings are summarised below. </p> <section id="CD011287-sec-0144"> <h4 class="title">Effect of dietary intervention on mortality and morbidity</h4> <p>Low‐certainty evidence assessed after 7.3 years suggested little if any benefit of dietary intervention for survival or secondary malignancy. Other comorbidities were not recorded. </p> </section> <section id="CD011287-sec-0145"> <h4 class="title">Effect of dietary intervention on dietary intake</h4> <p>Evidence assessed for dietary intervention after 12 months showed little or no effect on energy intake (moderate‐certainty evidence). When fruit and vegetable servings were combined, dietary intake was probably increased with dietary intervention (moderate‐certainty evidence), although for dietary fibre, the results were mixed. Evidence showed a probably positive effect of dietary intervention on Diet Quality Index (moderate‐certainty evidence). </p> </section> <section id="CD011287-sec-0146"> <h4 class="title">Effect of dietary intervention on anthropometry</h4> <p>Evidence assessed after 12 months showed little or no effect of dietary intervention on body weight (high‐certainty evidence). Evidence showed a probably slight decrease in body mass index after 12 months of dietary intervention (moderate‐certainty evidence). Evidence suggested little or no effect of dietary intervention on waist‐to‐hip ratio after 12‐months (low‐certainty evidence). We found no evidence on measurements of body composition. </p> </section> <section id="CD011287-sec-0147"> <h4 class="title">Effect of dietary intervention on quality of life after 12 months</h4> <p>We are uncertain about effects on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), Short Form (SF)‐36, cancer‐related fatigue, and global quality of life measures after 12 months of dietary intervention based on the evidence found (very low‐certainty evidence). </p> </section> <section id="CD011287-sec-0148"> <h4 class="title">Effect of dietary intervention on biochemistry</h4> <p>We are uncertain if dietary intervention has any effect on total cholesterol or triglycerides (very low‐certainty evidence). </p> </section> </section> <section id="CD011287-sec-0149"> <h3 class="title" id="CD011287-sec-0149">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</h3> <p>For this review, we searched only for studies including people living beyond cancer. We therefore excluded all studies that recruited participants at the start of their treatment programme or at any point in the care pathway when they were receiving treatment. We excluded from this review studies including people receiving hormone treatment who still had a malignant tumour. </p> <p>Evidence of effectiveness for most outcomes evaluated is incomplete, particularly for mortality, morbidity, some nutrients, body composition measurements, and quality of life (QoL) measures related to patient‐reported outcomes. In addition, evidence was often incompletely reported with missing standard deviations of the mean and reported differences in weights and measurements that varied from grams to number of servings and number of people consuming recommended amounts of food or nutrient. When we encountered missing data, we contacted some study authors to request further data, and only one study author provided data; however we did not incorporate these data into the review. This made it difficult to perform meta‐analyses for these outcomes, and when we did perform meta‐analyses, we included multiple analyses to present results reported in different formats. In some instances, heterogeneity was high, so we performed subgroup analyses to explore these based on ‘a priori’ criteria including different cancer types and varying nutritional status. </p> <p>When data were included but not in a form suitable for meta‐analysis, we tried to report these data in a narrative format when possible; however, we did not grade this evidence. </p> <p>In terms of specific outcomes, we found evidence on the primary outcome mortality, which showed little if any difference between groups, although there may be limitations in the time frame the evidence was reported, as it may have not been sufficient for dietary interventions to influence overall survival. Morbidity as a surrogate marker was not reported by any of the studies identified for this review, apart from secondary malignancies. Dietary interventions were found to have little effect on energy levels, and several studies reported this with a moderate level of certainty after 12 months. For fruit and vegetable intake, dietary intervention probably had some positive effects. We found evidence showing that diet quality was probably improved with dietary intervention, although results for dietary fibre were mixed. We found limited evidence for some cancer sites and noted differences on subgroup analyses conducted to examine sites of cancer and nutritional status. </p> <p>Researchers reported anthropometry using different measurements, some self‐reported. For body mass index, we found sufficient evidence to ascertain the effects of dietary interventions. Studies reporting body composition for fat and muscle as outcomes were lacking, so the evidence base is incomplete. </p> <p>For QoL measurements, included studies reported a variety of measurements, which meant there was no compelling evidence by which to determine overall effect. We found no evidence on patient‐reported outcomes. </p> <p>The evidence found was primarily based on women with breast cancer, so these results have limited generalisability to people with cancer at different sites. </p> </section> <section id="CD011287-sec-0150"> <h3 class="title" id="CD011287-sec-0150">Quality of the evidence</h3> <p>Most evidence is generally of low or very low‐certainty as assessed by GRADE (<a href="./references#CD011287-bbs2-0145" title="HigginsJPT , GreenS , editor(s) . Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011). London, UK: The Cochrane Collaboration,2011. ">Higgins 2011</a>), with most studies not evaluating effects of dietary interventions on key review outcomes, particularly the primary outcomes of mortality and morbidity (<a href="#CD011287-tbl-0008">Table 7</a>). Nonetheless, a few included studies did stand out, as they provided moderate‐certainty evidence on dietary intake and anthropometry (<a href="#CD011287-tbl-0009">Table 8</a>; <a href="#CD011287-tbl-0010">Table 9</a>). These studies included people with breast cancer and mixed cancer groups. Evidence was often undermined by unclear study methods or by study design limitations and small sample sizes, which led to downgrading of the evidence due to imprecision of estimates. Outcomes were often measured via self‐report tools and findings were poorly controlled in terms of definitions and judgements, particularly for some dietary assessment methods. Studies included were frequently downgraded for risk of bias due to absence of blinding for subjective outcomes. In addition, compliance with dietary interventions was seldom reported or assessed by objective tools. Adequate reporting of compliance with interventions is particularly problematic for dietary intervention studies. Furthermore, blinding of participants and professionals to dietary interventions is difficult when the intervention is based on food. </p> <div class="table" id="CD011287-tbl-0008"> <table><a

Some interventions were provided by telephone, others face‐to‐face or by mail, and others were web‐based. Different healthcare professionals provided information to participants including dietitians, healthcare workers, and trained coaches. The dietary intervention in some instances incorporated behavioural change theory, and in other instances did not involve behavioural change theory. Some included studies used a variety of modes to provide dietary interventions during the same study. </p> <p>Our definition of cancer survivorship may have led to potential biases in the approach to this review. Consequently, we may have favoured inclusion of studies on women with breast cancer and excluded studies on men with prostate cancer who have ongoing malignancies, which can be managed with biological agents and hormone therapies. The inclusion of a large proportion of studies on breast cancer has led to a bias in the review towards women. We are therefore uncertain if some of the evidence presented relates to men who have survived cancer. The definition of cancer survivors excluded studies that provided dietary interventions before cancer treatment, but those interventions could have been based on the same recommendations for survivorship. </p> <section id="CD011287-sec-0152"> <h4 class="title">Search methods</h4> <p>We did not handsearch all related journals and conference proceedings; we looked only at abstracts from the American Institute of Cancer Research that were available online. This may have led to our missing some abstracts. This decision was made at the protocol stage because to search all nutrition journals by hand would have been time‐consuming and would have been very resource‐intensive. We searched a number of databases and attempted to track down all reports of the same studies. However, due to the large number of reports identified and the volume of research reported in this area, some studies and reports may have been missed, even though efforts to follow the methods outlined in the protocol were extensive. </p> </section> <section id="CD011287-sec-0153"> <h4 class="title">Study selection</h4> <p>We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and we included only studies that reported a comparison between dietary intervention and usual care or written materials. We did not include studies that compared dietary interventions or different diets in people who had survived cancer. This limits our findings on comparison of dietary interventions to people who have survived cancer. </p> </section> <section id="CD011287-sec-0154"> <h4 class="title">Data extraction and analysis</h4> <p>When studies reported outcomes for multiple time points, we tried to report the time points at three, six, and 12 months, and for mortality at the last time point reported. When data were missing and we could calculate from the reports, we did so, and we used Cochrane tools to assist in some calculations. However, if data were not available and were not retrieved by contacting authors, we reported findings in a narrative format. We used the random‐effects model for all meta‐analyses, irrespective of statistical heterogeneity, as at the protocol stage, we anticipated that clinical heterogeneity with respect to study populations and interventions would be high across all included studies. All subgroup analyses that were performed were pre‐specified in the protocol. Subgroup analyses were performed by cancer site and nutritional status. We did not grade the certainty of evidence for narrative results. </p> </section> </section> <section id="CD011287-sec-0155"> <h3 class="title" id="CD011287-sec-0155">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</h3> <p>A number of other reviews have presented evidence on dietary interventions in people who have survived cancer (<a href="./references#CD011287-bbs2-0137" title="Demark‐WahnefriedW , RogersLQ , AlfanonCM , et al.

We reported on evidence from women with breast cancer including four studies that showed a slight reduction in body mass index (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, not all of these studies had dietary interventions that were aimed at weight reduction. Data from meta‐analysis on mean weight measured between groups in kilograms showed no differences among five studies after 12 months, although it has to be acknowledged that mean weight is not an ideal outcome to show differences between groups because it does not take into account changes as a proportion of overall body size.
