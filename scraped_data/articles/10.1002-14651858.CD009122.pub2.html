The patient populations varied widely across studies with one study only including children, one study only including patients after a kidney transplant, one study with newly diagnosed adult patients, and several studies where patients had retinopathy or microalbuminuria at baseline. The mean follow‐up duration across studies varied between one and 6.5 years. The majority of the studies were carried out in the 1980s and all trials took place in Europe or North America. Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies could be carried out in a blinded fashion so that the risk of performance bias, especially for subjective outcomes such as hypoglycaemia, was present in all of the studies. Fifty per cent of the studies were judged to have a high risk of bias in at least one other category. </p> <p>Under intensive glucose control, the risk of developing microvascular complications was reduced compared to conventional treatment for a) retinopathy: 23/371 (6.2%) versus 92/397 (23.2%); RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.42); P &lt; 0.00001; 768 participants; 2 trials; high quality evidence; b) nephropathy: 119/732 (16.3%) versus 211/743 (28.4%); RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.68); P &lt; 0.00001; 1475 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence; c) neuropathy: 29/586 (4.9%) versus 86/617 (13.9%); RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.53); P &lt; 0.00001; 1203 participants; 3 trials; high quality evidence. Regarding the progression of these complications after manifestation, the effect was weaker (retinopathy) or possibly not existent (nephropathy: RR 0.79 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.70); P = 0.55; 179 participants with microalbuminuria; 3 trials; very low quality evidence); no adequate data were available regarding the progression of neuropathy. For retinopathy, intensive glucose control reduced the risk of progression in studies with a follow‐up duration of at least two years (85/366 (23.2%) versus 154/398 (38.7%); RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.76); P &lt; 0.0001; 764 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence), while we found evidence for an initial worsening of retinopathy after only one year of intensive glucose control (17/49 (34.7%) versus 7/47 (14.9%); RR 2.32 (95% CI 1.16 to 4.63); P = 0.02; 96 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence). </p> <p>Major macrovascular outcomes (stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely, and no firm evidence could be established regarding these outcome measures (low quality evidence). </p> <p>We found that intensive glucose control increased the risk for severe hypoglycaemia, however the results were heterogeneous and only the 'Diabetes Complications Clinical Trial' (DCCT) showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment. A subgroup analysis according to the baseline haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of participants in the trials (low quality evidence) suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia is possibly only increased for patients who started with relatively low HbA1c values (&lt; 9.0%). Several of the included studies also showed a greater weight gain under intensive glucose control, and the risk of ketoacidosis was only increased in studies using insulin pumps in the intensive treatment group (very low quality evidence). </p> <p>Overall, all‐cause mortality was very low in all studies (moderate quality evidence) except in one study investigating renal allograft as treatment for end‐stage diabetic nephropathy. Health‐related quality of life was only reported in the DCCT trial, showing no statistically significant differences between the intervention and comparator groups (moderate quality evidence). In addition, only the DCCT published data on costs, indicating that intensive glucose therapy control was highly cost‐effective considering the reduction of potential diabetes complications (moderate quality evidence). </p> </section> <section id="CD009122-sec-0007"> <h3 class="title" id="CD009122-sec-0007">Authors' conclusions</h3> <p>Tight blood sugar control reduces the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications. The evidence of benefit is mainly from studies in younger patients at early stages of the disease. Benefits need to be weighed against risks including severe hypoglycaemia, and patient training is an important aspect in practice. The effects of tight blood sugar control seem to become weaker once complications have been manifested. However, further research is needed on this issue. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence from RCTs on the effects of tight blood sugar control in older patient populations or patients with macrovascular disease.

It is generally agreed that achieving 'good' blood sugar control while avoiding episodes of very low blood sugars (severe hypoglycaemia) should be the primary treatment goal for individuals with type 1 diabetes. However, clinical guidelines differ regarding their recommended blood glucose targets. </p> <p><b>Study characteristics</b> </p> <p>We identified 12 relevant studies, which included a total of 2230 participants. The participant populations varied widely across studies regarding age, disease duration, and existing diabetes complications. The mean follow‐up duration across studies varied between one and 6.5 years. The majority of the studies were carried out in the 1980s and all studies took place in Europe or North America. </p> <p><b>Key results</b> </p> <p>We found that intensive glucose control was highly effective in reducing the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications, such as retinopathy (eye disease), nephropathy kidney disease), and neuropathy (nerve disease). For developing retinopathy, 63 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 232 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication. For developing nephropathy, 159 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 284 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication. For developing neuropathy, 49 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 139 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication. </p> <p>A weaker effect was found on the progression of retinopathy, while we could not find clear evidence of benefit of tight blood sugar control on the progression of nephropathy once participants had developed microalbuminuria (the kidney leaking small amounts of the protein albumin into the urine); no adequate data were available regarding the progression of neuropathy. </p> <p>Major macrovascular outcomes (such as stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely; therefore we could not draw firm conclusions from the studies included in this review. </p> <p>We found that intensive glucose control can increase the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, however the results varied across studies and only one big study showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment. An analysis according to haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (a long‐term measure of glucose control) at the start of the study suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia with intensive glucose control is possibly only increased for people who started the study with relatively low HbA1c values (less than 9.0%). </p> <p>There were very few data on health‐related quality of life, death from any cause, and costs. Overall, mortality was very low in almost all studies. The effects of intensive glucose control on health‐related quality of life were unclear and were consistent with benefit or harm. One study reported that intensive glucose control could be highly cost‐effective when considering the potential reduction of diabetes complications in the future. </p> <p>Tight blood sugar control reduced the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications. The main benefits identified in this review came from studies in younger individuals who were at early stages of the disease. Appropriate patient training is important with these interventions in order to avoid the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. The effects of tight blood sugar control seem to become weaker once complications occur. However, further research is needed on this issue. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effects of tight blood sugar control on older patient populations or individuals with macrovascular disease.

Treatment targets in current guidelines vary between an HbA1c of 6.5% and 7.5% and it is unclear how these targets were established based on the evidence available. The evidence we have presented in this systematic review supports targeting tight (close to normal) glucose levels in young people at relatively early stages of the disease. Our results indicate that for this patient group intensive therapy leads to a reduced risk regarding the development of microvascular complications. The decision to implement these interventions needs to consider managing the risk of hypoglycaemia, highlighting the need for appropriate patient training and support. With the progression of microvascular diabetic complications, intensive treatment becomes less effective but can still slow the progression of retinopathy and possibly also other microvascular complications. Good blood glucose control might still be important, especially since there are likely to be many patients who exhibit some complications but not others. Overall, however, in the case of nephropathy the treatment of symptoms associated with these complications as well as the control of other risk factors, for example high blood pressure, diet and cholesterol levels, might become more important for the further progression of the diabetic complications. There is a general lack of evidence regarding the effects of intensive treatment in type 1 diabetes patients who are older or those who have already developed diabetic complications. We do not know the risks or benefits associated with introducing intensive treatment in older patients or patients with cardiovascular disease. </p> <p>Overall, no firm evidence exists regarding HbA1c thresholds for all type 1 diabetes patients; it seems necessary to set treatment goals at the individual patient level depending on age, disease progression, macrovascular risk, ability to avoid hypoglycaemic episodes, as well as psychological factors such as burden of tight blood glucose control on health‐related quality of life, fear of hypoglycaemia, or the mental capabilities of the patient to successfully manage the various components necessary for tight blood glucose control. </p> </section> <h3 class="title" id="CD009122-sec-0107">Implications for research</h3> <section id="CD009122-sec-0107"> <p>Further research is especially needed on whether intensive glucose control should be recommended for patients with type 1 diabetes who are of older age, at advanced stages of the disease, or with cardiovascular disease. The existing results based on randomised trials do not provide adequate data to give insights for such patient populations. Studies on patients with type 2 diabetes showed that especially for the subgroups of patients with long‐lasting diabetes or cardiovascular disease, tight blood glucose control does not show any benefits and might be associated with a higher mortality risk (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0090" title="GersteinHC , RiddleMC , KendallDM , CohenRM , GolandR , FeinglosMN , et al.

Good glycemic control remains crucial in prevention of late diabetic complications‐‐the Linkoping Diabetes Complications Study. Pediatric Diabetes2009;10(3):168‐76. ">Nordwall 2009</a>), many efforts are made to reduce blood glucose to as low as possible. Different types of approaches could be taken when aiming for a low glucose target. For example, one could change to a different insulin regimen, which might be more effective in lowering blood sugar levels than another regimen, or one could switch to a different type of insulin, which could potentially be more successful than other types. In general, all these efforts should be nested in patient counselling and education efforts, which are further factors helping to achieve good glycaemic control (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0056" title="AschnerP , HortonE , LeiterLA , MunroN , SkylerJS . Practical steps to improving the management of type 1 diabetes: recommendations from the Global Partnership for Effective Diabetes Management. International Journal of Clinical Practice2010;64(3):305‐15. ">Aschner 2010</a>). The primary research question for this review was to assess the effects of different blood glucose treatment targets and determine whether very low, near normoglycaemic values are of additional benefit. To answer this question, ideally only studies targeting different glycaemic levels but using identical insulin regimens in the treatment groups (for example multiple daily injections in both groups) should be considered. However, in previous studies with  type 1 diabetic patients, for example in the 'Diabetes Control and Complications Trial' (DCCT) (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0071" title="The DCCT Research Group. The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long‐term complications in insulin‐dependent diabetes mellitus. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group. The New England Journal of Medicine1993;329(14):977‐86. ">DCCT 1993</a>), the term 'intensive' therapy has often implied much more than just a lower glucose treatment target. In fact, intensive treatment usually refers to a multi‐factorial intervention with an intensified treatment regimen and additional factors such as patient education, individual counselling and increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring compared to the 'conventional' treatment. The results of these studies can only be attributed to a combination of factors rather than the effects of different glycaemic targets alone. </p> <p>Since the results of the DCCT became known, 'intensive insulin therapy' has become the standard therapy that is recommended by most clinical guidelines for patients with type 1 diabetes. In addition, most clinical guideline recommendations (see <a href="#CD009122-tbl-0002">Table 1</a>) take their evidence from the results (based on the achieved glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level) of the DCCT, in which the HbA1c treatment target of the intervention group was 6.05%. This target, however, was reached by less than 5% of the patients. On average, the HbA1c in this group could be reduced by 1.8% from 9.1% at baseline to a mean level of 7.1% throughout the randomised follow‐up period in the intervention group (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0071" title="The DCCT Research Group.

The results showed a substantial reduction in the risk of developing microvascular complications during the follow‐up period in the intervention group compared to the control group. The results regarding macrovascular complications were less clear. Although the number of macrovascular events was higher under conventional treatment than intensive treatment, the overall number of events was small so that the power of the study might not have been high enough for the effect to reach statistical significance (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0074" title="The DCCT Research Group.

Hypoglycemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular events. Diabetes Care2010;33(6):1389‐94. [PUBMED: 20508232] ">Desouza 2010</a>). To date it is not clear whether the situation could be similar in type 1 diabetes. A meta‐analysis from 2006 has found a decrease in long‐term clinical outcomes associated with strict glycaemic control (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0148" title="StettlerC , AllemannS , JuniP , CullCA , HolmanRR , EggerM , et al. Glycemic control and macrovascular disease in types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus: Meta‐analysis of randomized trials. American Heart Journal2006;152(1):27‐38. ">Stettler 2006</a>). However, in this analysis little attention was paid to differences regarding age, study duration and diabetes duration. Furthermore, this meta‐analysis analysed the risk of macrovascular disease but did not consider any other outcomes. It also did not study adverse effects of tight blood sugar control, such as hypoglycaemia, weight gain or a potential burden on the quality of life. In contrast to our review, Stettler et al (2006) did not focus on the effects of different treatment targets. They included all trials that compared regimens with the aim of improving glycaemic control compared to conventional treatment. Whether different treatment targets were set for the intensive and conventional treatment was not an inclusion criterion. </p> <p>Since the completion of the DCCT in 1993 intensive insulin therapy as well as other treatment innovations, such as new insulin analogues (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0145" title="SiebenhoferA , PlankJ , BergholdA , JeitlerK , HorvathK , NarathM , et al. Short acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin in patients with diabetes mellitus. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2006;19(2):CD003287. ">Siebenhofer 2006</a>), have become widely available to many type 1 diabetic patients. In addition, there have been improvements regarding the treatment of co‐morbidities such as hypertension. These factors have a significant impact on the clinical course of type 1 diabetes so that patients’ prospects today are much better than what they have been in the past (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0129" title="NathanDM , ZinmanB , ClearyPA , BacklundJY , GenuthS , MillerR , et al.

Archives of Internal Medicine2009;169(14):1307‐16. ">Nathan 2009</a>). This, however, also implies that in the future many more type 1 diabetic patients might reach old age and it will become an important question whether the treatment goals, which are predominantly based on relatively young patients, can be applied to an older age group. An analysis of different age subgroups as part of this meta‐analysis could potentially provide further insight. </p> <p>The recommended glycaemic target for type 1 diabetic patients varies between less than or equal to 6.5% and less than 7.5% in different clinical guidelines (see <a href="#CD009122-tbl-0002">Table 1</a>). Considering that more than 50% of type 1 diabetic patients do not achieve the highest target of less than 7.5%, as well as evidence from studies on type 2 diabetes that strict glucose control could potentially lead to an increased mortality risk, the balance of all harms and benefits related to interventions aimed at lowering glycaemic levels should be carefully evaluated. To date the risks of strict glycaemic control in type 1 diabetic patients are not fully understood and might differ depending on factors such as duration of diabetes, age, hypoglycaemic unawareness, baseline HbA1c levels and cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, a thorough evaluation of the potential benefits and harms that depend on these factors is important. </p> <p>At the heart of this review lies the question, considering that with current treatment very few type 1 diabetic patients achieve glycaemic levels close to those of a healthy person, should the optimal treatment always consist of aiming for a lower HbA1c; or could, depending on different patient factors, a higher glycaemic level be considered optimal when taking into account all harms and benefits? </p> </section> </section> </section> <section class="objectives"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD009122-sec-0035" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Objectives <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="objectives" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD009122-sec-0035"></div> <p>The primary objective of this review was to assess the effects of intensive versus conventional glycaemic targets in patients with type 1 diabetes in terms of long‐term complications and determine whether very low, near normoglycaemic values are of additional benefit. </p> </section> </section> <section class="methods"> <div class="section-header section-collapse-header" id="CD009122-sec-0036" lang="en"> <h2 class="title section-collapse-title"> Methods <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-caret-up section-collapse-icon"></i> </h2> </div> <section class="methods" lang="en"> <div class="section-header" id="CD009122-sec-0036"></div> <section id="CD009122-sec-0037"> <h3 class="title">Criteria for considering studies for this review</h3> <section id="CD009122-sec-0038"> <h4 class="title">Types of studies</h4> <p>Randomised controlled clinical trials with a parallel group design comparing different glycaemic treatment targets in people with type 1 diabetes that assess any of the outcome measures of interest for this review and have a follow‐up period of at least one year. </p> </section> <section id="CD009122-sec-0039"> <h4 class="title">Types of participants</h4> <p>Females and males of any age with type 1 diabetes mellitus were considered.

For studies using different treatment regimens (for example multiple daily injections versus conventional therapy), inclusion was accepted if a difference in glycaemic target could be clearly identified. Trials aiming for the same treatment targets or unspecified treatment targets in the different groups, although achieving differences in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at follow‐up, were excluded from this review. Either HbA1c (or equivalent, such as total glycosylated haemoglobin) target levels or target levels measured by fasting blood or plasma glucose or postprandial blood or plasma glucose had to be presented to fulfil the criteria for inclusion. </p> </section> <section id="CD009122-sec-0041"> <h4 class="title">Types of outcome measures</h4> <section id="CD009122-sec-0042"> <h5 class="title">Primary outcomes</h5> <p> <ul id="CD009122-list-0001"> <li> <p>Macrovascular complications (nonfatal and fatal myocardial infarction, stroke).</p> </li> <li> <p>Microvascular complications (manifestation and progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and endstage renal disease). </p> </li> <li> <p>Severe hypoglycaemic episodes.</p> </li> </ul> </p> </section> <section id="CD009122-sec-0043"> <h5 class="title">Secondary outcomes</h5> <p> <ul id="CD009122-list-0002"> <li> <p>Health‐related quality of life.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adverse events (e.g. hypoglycaemic episodes, ketoacidosis, weight gain).</p> </li> <li> <p>All‐cause mortality.</p> </li> <li> <p>Costs.</p> </li> </ul> </p> <section id="CD009122-sec-0044"> <h6 class="title">Timing of outcome measurement</h6> <p>If possible, outcomes were assessed as short‐term (less than two years) and long‐term (two years or more) measurements. </p> </section> </section> </section> </section> <section id="CD009122-sec-0045"> <h3 class="title">Search methods for identification of studies</h3> <section id="CD009122-sec-0046"> <h4 class="title">Electronic searches</h4> <p>We searched the following sources from inception of each database to the specified date. </p> <p> <ul id="CD009122-list-0003"> <li> <p><i>The Cochrane Library</i> (2012, Issue 12)<i>.</i> </p> </li> <li> <p>MEDLINE (until December 2012).</p> </li> <li> <p>EMBASE (until December 2012).</p> </li> </ul> </p> <p>We also searched the following trial registers: ClinicalTrials.gov (<a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank">www.clinicaltrials.gov/</a>), Current Controlled Trials metaRegister (<a href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/" target="_blank">http://www.controlled‐trials.com/mrct/</a>), the European (EU) Clinical Trials register (<a href="http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/" target="_blank">www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/</a>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<a href="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/" target="_blank">http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/</a>). </p> <p>For detailed search strategies see <a href="./appendices#CD009122-sec-0111">Appendix 1</a>.

">MDCCT 1994</a> reported a much higher incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events in the intensive treatment group compared to the control group (1.7 episodes per patient‐year versus &lt; 0.1 episodes per patient‐year). It was also reported that there were 26 hospital visits due to severe hypoglycaemia in the intervention group and three visits in the control group. Even though the number of patient‐years in the two groups that was used for the calculation of the incidence rates was not given, it is difficult to understand how such a low rate in the control group could be achieved. </p> <p>In the remaining 11 studies, 834 out of 2108 patients experienced at least one severe hypoglycaemic episode during follow‐up. A meta‐analysis of these studies provided a RR of 1.50 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.91; P = 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 52%; 2108 participants; 11 trials; <a href="./references#CD009122-fig-0022" title="">Analysis 1.18</a> ). <a href="./references#CD009122-fig-0023" title="">Analysis 1.19</a> and <a href="./references#CD009122-fig-0024" title="">Analysis 1.20</a> show the combined results of only those studies that had defined severe hypoglycaemia as an episode requiring the assistance of another person (RR 1.64 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.12); P = 0.0002; I<sup>2</sup> = 71%; 1653 participants; 4 trials) or those studies that used a definition that required either coma or hospital admission (RR 1.67 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.55); P = 0.02; I<sup>2</sup> = 63%; 1818 participants; 7 trials). However, heterogeneity was substantial in both analyses so that the pooled effect measures of these analyses should be interpreted with caution. The DCCT was included in both analyses since results on both outcomes were provided. Irrespective of the outcome definition, the analysis showed a higher risk of severe hypoglycaemia in the intensive treatment group. </p> <p>Results were dominated by the DCCT cohort. Leaving out the DCCT resulted in no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups (<a href="./references#CD009122-fig-0025" title="">Analysis 1.21</a>). </p> <p>We also checked whether the effect of intensive treatment on severe hypoglycaemia could be influenced by the baseline HbA1c level. <a href="#CD009122-fig-0004">Figure 4</a> shows that the HbA1c at baseline was correlated with the rate of severe hypoglycaemia across studies, which varied between 0 and 66 episodes per patient‐year and between 0 and 50 episodes per patient‐year in the treatment and control groups, respectively. </p> <div class="figure" id="CD009122-fig-0004"> <div class="figure-caption-wrapper-top"> <nav class="inline-nav-list has-dividers"> <ul> <li><a class="open-in-figure-viewer" href="#0">Open in figure viewer</a></li> </ul> </nav> <div class="figure-label">Figure 4</div> </div> <hr class="top"/><img alt="Relationship between baseline HbA1c and risk of severe hypoglycaemia." data-id="CD009122-fig-0004" src="/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009122.pub2/media/CDSR/CD009122/image_n/nCD009122-AFig-FIG04.png"/><hr class="bottom"/> <div class="figure-caption-wrapper-bottom"> <div class="figure-caption"> <p>Relationship between baseline HbA1c and risk of severe hypoglycaemia.</p> </div> </div> </div> <p>A meta‐analysis stratified the studies according to whether the studies demonstrated a baseline HbA1c equal to or greater than 9.0% or below 9.0%. It showed an increased risk for the intensive treatment groups in studies with participants starting at lower HbA1c values (RR 1.68 (95% CI 1.29 to 2.19); P = 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 78%; 1583 participants; 3 trials; <a href="./references#CD009122-fig-0026" title="">Analysis 1.22</a>.1), but no statistically significant effect for studies that had a high baseline HbA1c (RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.64); P = 0.86; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 525 participants; 8 trials; <a href="./references#CD009122-fig-0026" title="">Analysis 1.22</a>.2).

The cost difference between intensive and conventional treatment was largely due to the higher frequency of outpatient visits and the increased blood glucose self‐monitoring in the intensive treatment group. Also the costs for treating side effects were three times as high in the intervention group compared to the control group. However, overall treatment of side effects only constituted 5% of the costs. The higher costs of insulin pump therapy (CSII) compared to MI were entirely due to the higher costs of pump supplies.

Regarding the progression of these complications after manifestation, the effect is weaker (retinopathy) or possibly non‐existent (nephropathy). </p> <p>Based on the trials included in this review, we cannot provide results regarding the development of macrovascular complications since the incidence of major macrovascular events (strokes and myocardial infarctions) was too low. </p> <p>We found that intensive glucose control can be associated with a higher risk of adverse events, such as severe hypoglycaemic episodes, ketoacidosis and weight gain. The results regarding severe hypoglycaemia showed some heterogeneity, particularly in both DCCT cohorts. This heterogeneity could potentially be explained by study differences regarding the baseline HbA1c. Our results suggest that the risk of severe hypoglycaemia is particularly relevant for patients with lower HbA1c levels (&lt; 9.0%) who aim for more intensive glucose targets. </p> <p>We found that the risk of ketoacidosis was only increased in those studies that used insulin pumps in the intervention group. Therefore, ketoacidosis seems to be an adverse event of insulin pump therapy but not necessarily of intensive glucose control. </p> <p>Weight gain was not consistently assessed across the different trials but in those trials that presented results patients in the intervention group consistently showed a higher amount of weight gain. Whether this weight gain could be considered an adverse effect in the sense that it leads to patients being overweight was only analysed in the DCCT, in which the percentage of overweight patients increased under intensive treatment. </p> <p>Other outcomes assessed were health‐related quality of life, costs and all‐cause mortality. The former two were only assessed in the DCCT, showing no statistically significant effect regarding health‐related quality of life and higher costs associated with intensive treatment, which was however considered cost‐effective when taking into account the reduction in later diabetes complications. Mortality rates were similar in the treatment and control arms although overall the mortality rates were very low. </p> </section> <section id="CD009122-sec-0101"> <h3 class="title" id="CD009122-sec-0101">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</h3> <p>Our results are based on studies identified through an extensive and systematic literature search, including articles in all languages.

Some studies included only patients with background retinopathy, other studies looked at a patient population only of individuals with microalbuminuria and one study was carried out on patients who had received a kidney transplant. While the inclusion of all these different studies allowed us to cover a wide range of patients, as represented in the general population of patients with type 1 diabetes, our results should be interpreted with caution. First of all, the number of studies was too small to carry out extensive subgroup analyses that would allow us to investigate to what extent our results can be applied to all patients or only certain subgroups of patients. Secondly, apart from one study (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0012" title="HersheyT , BhargavaN , SadlerM , WhiteNH , CraftS .

We do not know how these changes could affect the results observed in the studies included in this review. Finally, most of the studies excluded patients above a certain age or with very long disease durations. Looking at the characteristics of the included trials, we can see that we do not have any evidence for old people with type 1 diabetes, nor for those who have lived with the disease for a long time nor those who received a late diagnosis. The exclusion of these patients might also be a reason for the lack of results on macrovascular complications, so that any evidence we have on this topic today is purely based on observational studies. </p> <p>The glycaemic targets that were defined in the included studies varied substantially from trial to trial, with definitions sometimes using pre‐ or postprandial blood glucose and sometimes HbA1c values.

Overall, the evaluation of the bias risks was hampered by the lack of information provided in many of the publications, so that we frequently had to judge the risk of bias as unclear. </p> <p>A major limitation of this review is that the intervention of interest (different glycaemic targets) was confounded by the type of treatment used in the two study arms. There was not a single study that only compared different glycaemic targets while keeping all other aspects of treatment constant. Therefore, our results cannot be fully attributed to the difference in treatment targets alone but might also be due to other differences in the treatment arms, such as type of insulin regimen, intensity of support through nurses and doctors, and more frequent blood glucose monitoring. </p> <p>The quality of the evidence provided in this review might further be limited by the heterogeneity among included trials due to baseline differences between patient groups, different lengths of follow‐up, and also due to a high variability regarding the definition of outcomes. We explored this heterogeneity through subgroup and sensitivity analyses but only to an extent considered adequate given the low number of trials included. The subgroups that were analysed sometimes only included two studies; therefore these results should be considered explorative and only seen in the context of the literature. </p> <p>Several outcomes, such as adverse events or mortality, were not assessed as the primary outcome in any of the trials. Therefore, reporting on these outcomes was frequently incomplete and the studies were not sufficiently powered to find effects on these outcomes. We tried to avoid outcome reporting bias by asking authors for additional data on these outcomes. However, since the studies included in this review were carried out many years ago many author requests remained unanswered or the study authors told us that it would not be feasible for them to access the original data of the trial (for more information on author requests see <a href="./appendices#CD009122-sec-0123">Appendix 13</a>). </p> <p>Diabetes complications are long‐term complications that often only develop after many years of the disease. RCTs with a follow‐up duration of just a few years can therefore only capture a small window out of the full time course for the development of these complications. If an intervention needs to be introduced at an early stage of the disease to be effective, as seems to be the case with intensive glucose control, it becomes almost impossible to study the effects on long‐term outcomes such as mortality or endstage renal disease within an RCT. </p> <p>Some of the included studies investigated the introduction of intensive treatment in patients who had already developed complications, but for some outcomes the amount of data in this patient population is still insufficient to draw reliable conclusions. None of the studies have focused on the progression of neuropathy, and for the progression of nephropathy the amount of data available in these studies is insufficient to clearly establish whether intensive therapy can still slow down further progression or becomes ineffective once a certain stage of the disease has been reached. </p> </section> <section id="CD009122-sec-0103"> <h3 class="title" id="CD009122-sec-0103">Potential biases in the review process</h3> <p>Many of the trials included in this review were relatively small, and we often observed a high amount of heterogeneity among these trials.

In general, the RCTs performed on intensive glucose control do not provide sufficient data to obtain reliable estimates on the mortality risks in the intervention and control arms. The results of the EDIC study on mortality are yet to be published but investigators have already mentioned that an increased risk of mortality as observed in the ACCORD study on type 2 diabetes (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0090" title="GersteinHC , RiddleMC , KendallDM , CohenRM , GolandR , FeinglosMN , et al.

However, the EDIC is likely to be the wrong study to provide an answer to the question of whether intensive therapy could be associated with an increased mortality risk, as described in some studies on type 2 diabetes. Such a study would need to investigate the introduction of (more) intensive therapy in an older population of patients with type 1 diabetes, where a large proportion of patients would show cardiovascular risk factors and may have already developed several other diabetic complications. There is currently a lack of data on this kind of patient population. </p> <p>Some observational data are available on old patients with type 1 diabetes who have lived with diabetes for more than 50 years (<a href="./references#CD009122-bbs2-0149" title="SunJK , KeenanHA , CavalleranoJD , AsztalosBF , SchaeferEJ , SellDR , et al.

Interestingly, in this patient cohort no association can be found between diabetic complications and the current or longitudinal HbA1c over the last 15 years. This further supports the idea that tight glycaemic control, while clearly being effective in a young and relatively healthy patient population, might not show the same effects in other patient groups. </p> </section> </section> </section> <div class="figures-list"> <div class="figure" id="CD009122-fig-0001"> <div> <p><a class="external"
